abstract = {Study objective: The main purpose of this paper was to assess the impact of the outdoor and indoor air quality on the growth rate of preadolescent children after accounting for parental height and potential confounders. The data were collected from a cohort prospective epidemiological study on the effect of air pollution on respiratory diseases in children in Krakow. Participants: Of the 1044 children covered by the study, the records were complete for 958 children. Characteristics of the outdoor air pollution level in the residence area was based on the communal air pollutants, such as SPM (suspended particulate matter) and SO2. In the city center (highly polluted area) the mean level of SPM over a 5-year period for the winter season was 103.5 $\mu$g/m3 and that of SO2 was 86.9 $\mu$ $\mu$g/m3; the corresponding values in the summer season were 32.3 $\mu$g/m3 and 41.8 $\mu$g/m3. The body growth rates of children were assessed by their height changes over a 2-year period. Main results: The body growth rates over the 2-year period in children from the highly polluted area was lower by 1.5 cm than those from the control area. Of the total growth rate variability explained by the multivariate model over the follow-up, about 3.1% has been explained by air pollution in the residence area. The compromising effect of higher air pollution in the residence area on height gain was about the same in shorter and taller children. Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that a child's growth rate is related to the postnatal air pollution level in the residence area. The results may have important implications for epidemiological studies on lung function in children related to environmental exposures. As the height gain is lower in exposed subjects and this does produce a height deficit, the estimates of adjusted lung function to body size may be biased. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

abstract = {We investigated how public perceptions of the links between air pollution and health varied with contextual factors describing individuals and their locality. Information was collected via postal surveys on 2744 adults resident in five neighborhoods in Northeast England. Perceptions were compared by individual factors (health status, age, and gender) and locality factors (relative deprivation, proximity to industry and district - Teesside or Sunderland, with different amounts of heavy industry). There was relatively little variation in views about air pollution and health links between neighborhoods. The greatest contrasts were found when comparing those living near or further from industry and between the two districts. Any differences were related more to awareness of illness in the neighborhood thought to be affected by air pollution, rather than belief that a particular disease was linked to air pollution. Chronic illness status and age were sometimes found to be associated with perceptions of disease affected by air pollution, but gender and material deprivation were not central to differences in risk perceptions among the population studied. In understanding public perceptions about the links between air quality and health, research should focus on the characteristics of places as well as of people. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {In the early days of abundant resources and minimal development pressures, little attention was paid to growing environmental concerns in Malaysia. The haze episodes in Southeast Asia in 1983, 1984, 1991, 1994, and 1997 imposed threats to the environmental management of Malaysia and increased awareness of the environment. As a consequence, the government established Malaysian Air Quality Guidelines, the Air Pollution Index, and the Haze Action Plan to improve air quality. Air quality monitoring is part of the initial strategy in the pollution prevention program in Malaysia. Review of air pollution in Malaysia is based on the reports of the air quality monitoring in several large cities in Malaysia, which cover air pollutants such as Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM). The results of the monitoring indicate that Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) are the predominant pollutants. Other pollutants such as CO, Ox, SO2, and Pb are also observed in several big cities in Malaysia. The air pollution comes mainly from land transportation, industrial emissions, and open burning sources. Among them, land transportation contributes the most to air pollution. This paper reviews the results of the ambient air quality monitoring and studies related to air pollution and health impacts. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this study we considered confounding from air pollutants and chronological variables in the relation between humidex, a summer temperature and humidity index, and nonaccidental mortality, from 1980-1996 in Toronto, Canada. Changes in the risk of death by age group, gender, and combined cardiac-respiratory cause of death were estimated for both 1°C and 50-95th percentile increases in humidex using a generalized additive linear model. With air pollution terms in the models, relative risk (RR) point estimates narrowly exceeded 1.0 for all groups. Humidex effects were most apparent for females (RR=1.006, 95% CI=1.004-1.008 per 1°C humidex and RR=1.089, 95% CI=1.058-1.121 for 50th to 95th percentile humidex). When air pollution was omitted from the model, RR in the 50-95th percentile analysis increased less than 1.71% for all groups except females, for which RR decreased 1.42%. Differences in RR per 1°C humidex were all less than 0.12%. Confidence intervals narrowed slightly for all groups investigated. Heat stress has a statistically significant, yet minimal impact on Toronto populations, and air pollution does appear to have a small, but consistent confounding effect on humidex effect estimates. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {In Durban, South Africa studies have shown that more than seven out of ten households in low-income metropolitan areas rely on kerosene for domestic purposes, leading to widespread problems of poor indoor air quality. In light of the known health effects of kerosene usage, this study aimed to quantify the health risk for people living in a densely populated informal settlement known as Cato Crest within the Durban metropolitan area. The pollutants investigated included nitrogen dioxide, benzene and toluene. Nitrogen dioxide is known to affect both respiratory and immune systems, benzene is carcinogenic while toluene has a neurological health end point. All three pollutants are harmful when inhaled. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) health risk assessment (HRA) framework was applied. Information on the exposure patterns of residents in Cato Crest were acquired through questionnaires in which data on fuel use, building structure, cooking habits and time-activity patterns were collected. Air quality monitoring of nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds was also conducted in the households. The time-activity pattern survey revealed that the exposure periods of individuals in Cato Crest were far greater than the default exposure periods used by the US EPA. The results of the HRA showed that the residents of Cato Crest may experience significant health risks as a result of kerosene usage in their homes. Exposure to 1-h nitrogen dioxide concentration is not likely to produce adverse health effects, whereas exposure over a 24-h period indicates a potential health risk to sensitive individuals in two of the households when US EPA exposure values are used and in all of the households when locally derived exposure values are used. Benzene poses a health risk to sensitive individuals in 50% of the households when local exposure parameters are used, whereas there is no health risk associated with exposure to toluene. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Daily emergency room admissions to the Institute of the Heart of the University of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, as well as data concerning daily air pollutant levels and meteorological variables, were collected from January 1994 to August 1995. Generalized additive Poisson regressions were fitted to the logarithm of the expected values of total emergency room visits due to angina or acute myocardial infarction, controlling for smooth functions of season and weather and indicators for days of the week. All investigated pollutants were positively associated with ischemic cardiovascular disease emergency room visits, and the time lags were relatively short, but only CO presented an effect that was statistically significant. An interquartile range increase in CO was associated with an increase of 6.4% (95% CI: 0.7-12.1) in daily angina or acute myocardial infarction emergency room visits. This result did not change when estimates were done using linear models and natural cubic splines.

abstract = {We conducted a mortality time series study to investigate the association between daily mortality for congestive heart failure (CHF), and daily concentrations of particles and gaseous pollutants in the ambient air of Montreal, Quebec, during the period 1984-1993. In addition, using data from the universal Quebec Health Insurance Plan, we identified individuals ≥65 years of age who, one year before death, had a diagnosis of CHF. Fixed-site air pollution monitors in Montreal provided daily mean levels of pollutants. We regressed the logarithm of daily counts of mortality on the daily mean levels of each pollutant, after accounting for seasonal and subseasonal fluctuations in the mortality time series, non-Poisson dispersion, weather variables, and other gaseous and particle pollutants. Using cause of death information, we did not find any associations between daily mortality for CHF and any air pollutants. The analyses of CHF defined from the medical record showed positive associations with coefficient of haze, the extinction coefficient, SO2, and NO2. For example, the mean percent increase in daily mortality for an increase in the coefficient of haze across the interquartile range was 4.32% (95% CI: 0.95-7.80%) and for NO2 it was 4.08% (95% CI: 0.59-7.68%).

abstract = {Many studies have shown a positive association between ambient ozone levels and mortality. Typically, these findings are based on models that assume a linear relationship between log mortality and ozone level. In this study, we adapted generalized additive models in which ozone effects are presumed to occur in three different ways: as a simple linear term, as a cubic natural spline term, and as a combination of two linear terms (a threshold model). We applied these models to daily time-series data for Seoul, Korea for the years 1995-1999 and found that the threshold model always fits best among the three. A 2.6% (95% CI: 1.7-3.5) increase of estimated relative risk (RR) in the total mortality associated with a 21.5ppb increase of daily 1-h maximum ozone lagged by 1 day was observed by linear Poisson's regression. However, a 3.4% (95% CI: 2.3-4.4) increase in the estimated RR was observed using the threshold model. Adjustments for other ambient pollutants caused little changes to these results; 2.4-2.5% in the linear models and 3.2-3.4% in the threshold models. In addition, the largest difference in the estimated RRs of the linear and threshold models was observed in the summer: 1.9% (95% CI: 0.5-3.3) by the linear model and 3.8% (95% CI: 2.0-5.7) by the threshold model. These findings indicate that the conventional time-series Poisson regression model, which dose not take threshold into consideration, could underestimate the true risk of the ozone effect on daily mortality. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this study was to assess the possible effects of Asian dust storms on the mortality of residents in Taipei, Taiwan, during the period from 1995 to 2000. We identified 39 dust storm episodes, which were classified as index days. Daily deaths on the index days were compared with deaths on the comparison days. We selected two comparison days for each index day, 7 days before the index day and 7 days after the index day. The strongest estimated effects of dust storms were increases of 7.66% in risk for respiratory disease 1 day after the event, 4.92% for total deaths 2 days following the dust storms and 2.59% for circulatory diseases 2 days following the dust storms. However, none of these effects were statistically significant. This study found greater specificity for associations with respiratory deaths, and this increases the likelihood that the association between dust events and daily mortality represents a causal relationship. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

At four different sites in Austria (3 urban and one rural site) an extended monitoring program was conducted for PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 as well as particle number concentration for 12 months each. Beside continuous measurements using TEOM and beta attenuation high-volume sampling of PM2.5 and PM10 provided samples for chemical analyses of various ions, heavy metals and organic compounds. Furthermore, carbonaceous material (TC, EC, OC) year round and PAHs on selected days were analyzed. From collocated public monitoring stations also pollutant gases (SO2, NO, NO2, O3, CO) and meteorological components are available. In winter and summer campaigns aerosol size spectra including chemical components were measured for at least one week each. All data are collected in a project data base (CD-ROM). While extensive data analysis will be presented in following papers, some general results are presented within this paper: annual averages for PM1 are between 10 and 20$\mu$gm -3, for PM2.5 between 15 and 26mgm-3 and for PM10 between 20 and 38$\mu$gm-3. Number concentrations are between 10,000 and 30,000cm-3. Urban concentrations are usually higher in winter, rural concentrations in summer. PM2.5 is in average around 70% of PM10, for PM1 this fraction is about 57%. Several studies on health effects are included in this project: a cross-sectional study on preschool and school children regarding lung function measurements and questionnaires about respiratory impairment in the surrounding area of the monitoring sites as well as time series studies on mortality and respiratory morbidity on the general population. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Pollutants emitted to the atmosphere in the course of cement production were modeled. The ISC3-ST model was applied to estimate air dispersion of the contaminants emitted by the cement plant. Air concentrations of NO2, SO2, PM10, metals, and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), as well as the potential exposure in the vicinity of the facility, were assessed via models based on US EPA guidance documents. PCDD/F and metal concentrations were also modeled for soil and vegetation. Based on these concentrations, the levels of human exposure were calculated. Individual cancer and noncancer risks for the emissions of the cement kiln were assessed. Health effects due to NO2, SO2, and PM10 emissions were also evaluated. Risk assessment was performed as a deterministic analysis. The main individual risk in the population was evaluated in a central-tendency and a high-end approach. The results show that the incremental individual risk due to emissions of the cement plant is very low not only with regard to health effects, but also in relation to toxicological and cancer risks produced by pollutants such as metals and PCDD/Fs emitted by the cement kiln. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

We investigated the distribution over time of effect of air pollution on short-term mortality among subjects aged 65 years and older and of all ages in Bordeaux, France. Statistical analysis was based on generalized additive models using either loess or penalized spline smoothing. Our study found a significant positive association between air pollution and all nonaccidental mortality and specific mortality in both group of population (all ages and elderly) with a greater effect among the elderly, particularly for respiratory mortality. For this case, we observed a greater effect according to distributed lag models (0-5 days) among the elderly, with an estimated increase of 9.2% in the daily number of deaths for 10$\mu$g/m3 of daily black smoke [95% CI, 3.4-15.3].

abstract = {Building occupants, including cleaning personnel, are exposed to a wide variety of airborne chemicals when cleaning agents and air fresheners are used in buildings. Certain of these chemicals are listed by the state of California as toxic air contaminants (TACs) and a subset of these are regulated by the US federal government as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). California's Proposition 65 list of species recognized as carcinogens or reproductive toxicants also includes constituents of certain cleaning products and air fresheners. In addition, many cleaning agents and air fresheners contain chemicals that can react with other air contaminants to yield potentially harmful secondary products. For example, terpenes can react rapidly with ozone in indoor air generating many secondary pollutants, including TACs such as formaldehyde. Furthermore, ozone-terpene reactions produce the hydroxyl radical, which reacts rapidly with organics, leading to the formation of other potentially toxic air pollutants. Indoor reactive chemistry involving the nitrate radical and cleaning-product constituents is also of concern, since it produces organic nitrates as well as some of the same oxidation products generated by ozone and hydroxyl radicals. Few studies have directly addressed the indoor concentrations of TACs that might result from primary emissions or secondary pollutant formation following the use of cleaning agents and air fresheners. In this paper, we combine direct empirical evidence with the basic principles of indoor pollutant behavior and with information from relevant studies, to analyze and critically assess air pollutant exposures resulting from the use of cleaning products and air fresheners. Attention is focused on compounds that are listed as HAPs, TACs or Proposition 65 carcinogens/reproductive toxicants and compounds that can readily react to generate secondary pollutants. The toxicity of many of these secondary pollutants has yet to be evaluated. The inhalation intake of airborne organic compounds from cleaning product use is estimated to be of the order of 10mgd-1person-1 in California. More than two dozen research articles present evidence of adverse health effects from inhalation exposure associated with cleaning or cleaning products. Exposure to primary and secondary pollutants depends on the complex interplay of many sets of factors and processes, including cleaning product composition, usage, building occupancy, emission dynamics, transport and mixing, building ventilation, sorptive interactions with building surfaces, and reactive chemistry. Current understanding is sufficient to describe the influence of these variables qualitatively in most cases and quantitatively in a few. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There is increasingly growing evidence linking urban air pollution to acute and chronic illnesses amongst all age groups. Therefore, monitoring of ambient concentrations of various air pollutants as well as quantification of the dose inhaled becomes quite important, specially in view of the fact that in many countries, policy decisions for reducing pollutant concentrations are mainly taken on the basis of their health impacts. The dose when gets combined with the likely responses, indicates the ultimate health risk (HR). Thus, as an extension of our earlier studies, HR has been estimated for three pollutants, namely, suspended particulate matter (SPM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) for Delhi City in India. For estimation and analyses, three zones have been considered, namely, residential, industrial and commercial. The total population has been divided into three age classes (infants, children and adults) with different body weights and breathing rates. The exercise takes into account age-specific breathing rates, body weights for different age categories and occupancy factors for different zones. Results indicate that health risks due to air pollution in Delhi are highest for children. For all age categories, health risks due to SO2 (HR_SO 2) are the lowest. Hence, HR_SO2 has been taken as the reference with respect to which HR values due to SPM and NO2 have been compared. Taking into account all the age categories and their occupancy in different zones, average HR values for NO2 and SPM turn out to be respectively 22.11 and 16.13 times more than that for SO2. The present study can be useful in generating public awareness as well as in averting and mitigating the health risks. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Epidemiological data show an association between exposure to elevated levels of particulate matter (PM), in particular the fine fraction (<2.5 $\mu$m in diameter), and an increase in cardiovascular mortality and respiratory symptoms. The aim of this study was to compare the in vitro toxicity of coarse and fine particulate matter collected with a cascade impactor during winter in an urban area of Rome in relation to their physicochemical characterization (size distribution and chemical composition) as assessed by analytical electron microscopy (SEM/EDX). The X-ray microanalysis data of single particles of coarse and fine matter were analyzed by hierarchical cluster analysis to determine the principal component of the two granulometric fractions. The main chemical difference between the two fractions was the greater abundance of carbonaceous particles in the fine fraction. We compared the ability of coarse and fine fractions, carbon black (CB), and residual oil fly ash (ROFA) to induce arachidonic acid release and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) production in the monocytic-macrophagic RAW 264.7 cell line at concentrations of 30 and 120 $\mu$g/mL. Our results showed that CB and ROFA were consistently less effective than both fractions of urban particles at inducing an inflammatory reaction in RAW 264.7 cells. Both PM fractions dose-dependently increased TNF-$\alpha$ production in RAW 264.7 cells after 5 and 24 h of incubation, and only the TNF-$\alpha$ production induced by coarse particles at 30 $\mu$g/mL decreased significantly (P<0.01) after 24 h of treatment. In our in vitro model the winter fine fraction was more reactive than the winter coarse fraction, in contrast to a previously examined summer sample. In the summer sample, coarse particles produced higher levels of inflammatory mediators than fine particles and the CB was consistently less effective than the urban particles. The different behaviors between summer and winter urban fractions may be due to their different physicochemical characteristics; in fact, the comparison of the two samples' characterization by SEM/EDX and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that in winter the carbonaceous particles are more abundant than in summer and that winter particles carry a greater quantity of organic compounds. We suggest that the higher concentration of organic compounds on fine carbonaceous particles may partially explain the higher activation of RAW 264.7 cells by fine particles. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this study was to assess the possible associations of ADS on the hospital stroke admissions of residents in Taipei, Taiwan, during the period from 1996 to 2001. We identified 54 dust storm episodes, which were classified as index days. Daily stroke admissions on the index days were compared with admissions on the comparison days. We selected two comparison days for each index day, 7 days before the index days and 7 days after the index days. The study results indicated a statistically significant association between ADS events and daily primary intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke admissions 3 days after the event (relative risk of 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-10.10). We also found a positive but nonsignificant association between ADS events and ischemic stroke admissions 3 days following the dust storms. This was due mainly to PM10. We conclude that more attention be given to ADS events and health in the future. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies typically utilise one or few central monitoring stations as a proxy for personal exposure to particulate matter air pollution. However, recent research indicates that central monitoring sites may not accurately characterize the spatial complexities of the particulate field across an urban area. Consequently, intraurban assessment of exposure to air pollution has become a priority area of study. This paper reviews particulate air pollution exposure studies with a focus on monitored-data studies at the intraurban spatial scale. Portions of the literature provide contradictory conclusions as to the homogeneity of intraurban particulate concentrations, due in part to local conditions such as source composition, meteorology, locations of monitoring sites and topography, but which may also be a result of the methods and definitions used to quantify relative and absolute spatial concentration variations. Comparative analyses of the literature by particle size fraction, method of determining heterogeneity, and sampling characteristics were performed. We find that particular attention should be given to local conditions and methods when using one or few monitoring sites to characterise wider population exposures. The utilisation of absolute and relative measures of homogeneity such as the coefficient of divergence which are based on data from several monitoring sites (e.g., n>4) in combination with an appropriate sample size (e.g., n≥50) may reduce the possibility of misclassification based on incorrect assumptions about heterogeneity. The errors in exposure misclassification based on these assumptions about intraurban concentration variations are especially critical in long-term cohort epidemiological analyses that assess the effects of exposure variations in air pollution upon health. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A model for simulating desert dust cycle was adapted and applied for a dust storm case in the southwest United States (US). This is an initial test of the model's capability as part of a future public health early warning system. The modeled meteorological fields, which drive a dust storm, were evaluated against surface and upper-air measurement data. The modeled dust fields were compared with satellite images, in situ surface PM2.5 and PM10 data, and visibility data in the areas affected by the dust event. The model predicted meteorological fields reasonably well. The modeled surface and upper-air field patterns were in agreement with the measured ones. The vertical profiles of wind, temperature, and humidity followed closely with the observed profiles. Statistical analyses of modeled and observed meteorological variables at surface sites showed fairly good model performance. The modeled dust spatial distributions were comparable with the satellite-observed dust clouds and the reduced visibility patterns. Most encouragingly, the model-predicted and observed PM2.5 peak hours matched reasonably well. The model produced better PM2.5 peak hours than PM10 peak hours. The temporal varying trends of daily and hourly PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations at most of the measurement sites were similar to those observed. Discrepancies between the values of the modeled and the measured surface PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations differed with time and location. Sometimes the modeled and measured concentrations can have one order of magnitude differences. These revealed there were possible deficiencies in the simulation of the dust production strength and location, and the representation of dust particle size in the modeling. Better land surface data and size representation of the dust production are expected to further improve model performance. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present a proof-of-concept analysis of the measurement of the health damage of ozone (O3) produced from nitrogen oxides (NO x=NO+NO2) emitted by individual large point sources in the eastern United States. We use a regional atmospheric model of the eastern United States, the Comprehensive Air quality Model with Extensions (CAMx), to quantify the variable impact that a fixed quantity of NOx emitted from individual sources can have on the downwind concentration of surface O 3, depending on temperature and local biogenic hydrocarbon emissions. We also examine the dependence of resulting O3-related health damages on the size of the exposed population. The investigation is relevant to the increasingly widely used "cap and trade" approach to NO x regulation, which presumes that shifts of emissions over time and space, holding the total fixed over the course of the summer O3 season, will have minimal effect on the environmental outcome. By contrast, we show that a shift of a unit of NOx emissions from one place or time to another could result in large changes in resulting health effects due to O3 formation and exposure. We indicate how the type of modeling carried out here might be used to attach externality-correcting prices to emissions. Charging emitters fees that are commensurate with the damage caused by their NOx emissions would create an incentive for emitters to reduce emissions at times and in locations where they cause the largest damage. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Emissions from power plant pose a potentially large risk to human health and the environment. This pollution source is of particular concern in Mexico, where a large share of electricity is generated by the burning of high-sulfur fuel oil. In this paper, we estimate the health impacts due to air pollution from one of the Mexico's largest power plants, Tuxpan, located on the eastern coast. We calculate the annual average concentrations of primary and secondary (sulfates and nitrates) particulate matter, by modeling representative periods during the year 2001 using the CALPUFF-CALMET modeling system. We find that emissions from the power plant resulted in annual average concentrations of 0.12 $\mu$g m-3 (min-max: 0.00-1.43) for primary PM2.5, 0.64 $\mu$g m-3 (0.01-2.84) for secondary PM2.5 and 3.09 $\mu$g m-3 (0.01-41.54) for SO2 in the 120 km×120 km modeling domain. Such concentrations, while mostly affecting a relatively rural area, could result in significant public health and economic impacts for the local population. It is important to consider such damages when evaluating different electricity generation and control technologies. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A total of 756 individuals in three population strata (elderly, students, and workers) provided first morning void urine specimens the day after exposure and food surveys were administered. Arsenic intake from drinking water was estimated from analysis of tap water samples, plus 24-h dietary recall and food frequency questionnaires. Multilevel analysis was used to evaluate the effects of the age group and city factors adjusted by predictor variables. Arsenic levels in drinking water and urine were significantly higher in Antofagasta compared with the other cities. City-and individual-level factors, 12% and 88%, respectively, accounted for the variability in urinary arsenic concentration. The main predictors of urinary arsenic concentration were total arsenic consumption through water and age. These findings indicate that arsenic concentration in drinking water continues to be the principal contributing factor to exposure to inorganic arsenic in the Chilean population. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Hospital admissions for CVD and ambient air pollution data for Taipei were obtained for the period 1997-2001. The relative risk of hospital admission was estimated using a case-crossover approach, controlling for weather variables, day of the week, seasonality, and long-term time trends. For the one-pollutant models, on warm days (≥20°C) statistically significant positive associations were found between levels of particulate matter <10-$\mu$m aerodynamic diameter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3). On cool days (< 20°C), all pollutants except O3 and SO 2 were significantly associated with CVD admissions. For the two-pollutant models, CO, NO2, and O3 were significant in combination with each of the other four pollutants on warm days. On cool days, PM10 remained statistically significant in all the two-pollutant models. This study provides evidence that higher levels of ambient pollutants increase the risk of hospital admissions for CVD. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We carried out this mortality time series study in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to confirm these observations and to determine whether diabetics who had other health conditions were also at higher risk of dying when air pollution increases. Methods and results: In one analysis, we related daily deaths from diabetes (using the underlying cause) to daily concentrations of particles and gaseous pollutants. In another analysis, we created subgroups by identifying subjects diagnosed 1 year before death with diabetes and other major health conditions from billing and prescription data from the universal Quebec Health Insurance Plan. The analysis made use of parametric log-linear Poisson models that were adjusted for long-term temporal trends and daily weather conditions. We found positive associations between most air pollutants and daily mortality from diabetes as well as among subjects diagnosed with diabetes 1 year before death. In the latter group of subjects, greater effects were found generally in the warm season and especially among subjects who had diabetes and who also had any cardiovascular disease, chronic coronary disease, and atherosclerosis. We did not find evidence of associations among persons who only had diabetes (i.e., did not also have cancer, cardiovascular disease, or lower respiratory disease). Conclusions: These data indicate that individuals with diabetes who also have cardiovascular disease may be susceptible to the short-term effects of air pollution. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Annual mean concentrations of benzene, CO, NO2, NOx, PM10 and SO2 were calculated, in front of the 108 schools attended by the children, by the validated STREET 5 software, which combines data on regional and local components of AP. STREET contains a database of emissions estimated by the IMPACT 2.0 software developed by ADEME-France and results of ambient concentrations modelled by the WinMISKAM 4.2 dispersion model. The input data required were background AP, traffic conditions (daily traffic density; average speed; percentage of gridlocks and proportion of each type of vehicle) and dispersion conditions (topography of the street segments modelled and meteorology). Emissions of air pollutants in front of the 108 schools were considerably scattered. Calculated concentrations ($\mu$g m-3) also varied considerably at: [1.0-5.1] for benzene, [303.8-988.1] for CO, [17.8-78.9] for NO2, [23.3-195.2] for NOx, [10.0-52.0] for PM 10 and [2.4-16.4] for SO2. About 64% (29%, respectively) of the schools had annual mean concentrations of NO2 (PM 10, respectively) exceeding the European quality objectives (40 and 30 $\mu$g m-3, respectively). These exposure indicators, capable of identifying small area variations in AP contrary to surrogate measures usually used in epidemiology, will enable better studies on the impact of urban AP on health. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Urban centers in Latin American often face high levels of air pollution as a result of economic and industrial growth. Decisions with regard to industry, transportation, and development will affect air pollution and health both in the short term and in the far future through climate change. We investigated the pollution health consequences of modest changes in fossil fuel use for three case study cities in Latin American: Mexico City, Mexico; Santiago, Chile; and S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil. Annual levels of ozone and particulate matter were estimated from 2000 to 2020 for two emissions scenarios: (1) business-as-usual based on current emissions patterns and regulatory trends and (2) a control policy aimed at lowering air pollution emissions. The resulting air pollution levels were linked to health endpoints through concentration-response functions derived from epidemiological studies, using local studies where available. Results indicate that the air pollution control policy would have vast health benefits for each of the three cities, averting numerous adverse health outcomes including over 156,000 deaths, 4 million asthma attacks, 300,000 children's medical visits, and almost 48,000 cases of chronic bronchitis in the three cities over the 20-year period. The economic value of the avoided health impacts is roughly $21 to $165 billion (US). Sensitivity analysis shows that the control policy yields significant health and economic benefits even with relaxed assumptions with regard to population growth, pollutant concentrations for the control policy, concentration-response functions, and economic value of health outcomes. This research demonstrates the health and economic burden from air pollution in Latin American urban centers and the magnitude of health benefits from control policies. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Blood pressure was measured by a digital monitor. Particle concentrations (PM10) were obtained from the AIRAQ association that operates a local monitoring network of the air quality. To represent the ambient urban air pollution, stations had to be sufficiently correlated (i.e., correlation >0.70) and to have sufficiently similar mean levels of pollution. Linear regression was used to model the association between concentrations of particles (PM10) and systolic blood pressure. We observed associations between the fifth lag hour and systolic blood pressure for an increase of 10 $\mu$g/m 3 of PM10 ($\beta$=-1.12, 95% confidence interval: [-1.90; -0.30]). Despite contradictory results, fine particles must be considered nowadays as a major component of atmospheric air pollution in which everything must be put into practice in terms of public health actions in order to protect the general population and particularly the elderly group. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The importance of airborne particulate matter (PM) in causing increases in morbidity and mortality in humans has been confirmed by numerous epidemiological and laboratory studies. It has been proposed that PM might deliver transition metals to the airways were they react and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus promoting the expression of inflammatory mediators, and cytotoxicity. In Puerto Rico (PR), the northern Guaynabo area is a US EPA non-attainment zone for PM10 (PM with a mass median aerodynamic diameter ≤10 $\mu$m), and a previous study found that organic PM10 extracts from this area were cytotoxic. The purpose of this research project is to compare the toxicity between organic PM extracts from Guaynabo (a coastal urban site) and Fajardo (a coastal rural town) based on their polarity, collection season, and geographical location. We will also evaluate if the metal content of such extracts is associated with their biological activity. PM10 filters from both locations were subjected to a sequential Soxhlet extraction using hexane and acetone. Normal and transformed bronchial epithelial cells were then exposed to the extracts. Using the neutral red assay to measure cell viability we found that coastal urban PM from PR generally exhibits higher cytotoxicity than coastal rural PM. However, this effect is dependent on the polarity of the extracts and the collection season (in winter hexane PM10 is more toxic, whereas during the summer acetone PM10 is more toxic). We also found that non-polar organic constituents in PM from PR are generally more toxic than the polar organic constituents. The main conclusion from this work is that the metal contents of the organic PM extracts from PR could play a minor role in the cytotoxicity observed. This is supported by the findings of elements such as As, V, Ni, and Cu in the most cytotoxic extracts. However, organic compounds probably play the major role. The presence of bioactive fractions of PM underscores the importance of conducting more detailed studies. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Unusual air pollution episodes, such as when smoke from wildfires covers a large urban area, can be used to attempt to detect associations between short-term increases in particulate matter (PM) concentrations and subsequent mortality without relying on the sophisticated statistical models that are typically required in the absence of such episodes. The objective of this study was to explore whether acute increases in PM concentrations from wildfire smoke cause acute increases in daily mortality. The temporal patterns of daily nonaccidental deaths and daily cardiorespiratory deaths for June of 2002 in the Denver metropolitan area were examined and compared to those in two nearby counties in Colorado that were not affected by the wildfire smoke and to daily deaths in Denver in June of 2001. Abrupt increases in PM concentrations in Denver occurred on 2 days in June of 2002 as a result of wildfire smoke drifting over the Denver area. Small peaks in mortality corresponded to both of the PM peaks, but the first mortality peak also corresponded to a peak of mortality in the control counties, and cardiorespiratory deaths began to increase on the day before the second peak. Further, there was no detectable increase in cardiorespiratory deaths in the hours immediately following the PM peaks. Although the findings from this study do not rule out the possibility of small increases in mortality due to abrupt and dramatic increases in PM concentrations from wildfire smoke, in a population of over 2 million people no perceptible increases in daily mortality could be attributed to such events. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Cancer is a health endpoint influenced by a multitude of factors, including genetic history, individual behavior, and environmental insults. The ubiquity of toxicants in the environment has raised questions about the extent of their role in causing cancer in humans. More specifically, it is desirable to understand the cancer incidence due to airborne toxicants in anthropogenic pollution. One particular class of such pollutants is volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This paper reports an epidemiological investigation of the incidence of cancer in the 92 counties of Indiana. We evaluated the relationship between the amount of VOCs released in each county, as reported by the Toxic Release Inventory, and the county-by-county incidence of various types of cancer, especially those of less common organ systems not directly associated with the absorption or distribution of toxicants. Our evaluation considered chlorinated versus nonchlorinated emissions as well as stack versus fugitive emissions. We evaluated three models: linear, quadratic, and polynomial. Of these, the quadratic model appeared to be the best predictor (highest r2) for most endpoints for which there was a positive correlation. However, the linear model was the most sensitive (lowest P-value) for skin, melanoma, and endocrine-related cancers, including female genital system cancers. Our results indicate a relationship between emissions of VOCs and the incidence of some types of cancers. Most notable were strong correlations between VOC emissions and cancers of the brain, nervous system, endocrine system, and skin. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The aim of the study was to evaluate whether parental smoking might lead to asthma and allergies taking into account family history of asthma, personal atopy, breast feeding as confounders and owing pets and day-care during the first 6 months of life as modifiers. About 9000 children of fourth and fifth grade were selected in six cities of France. About 7798 answered an epidemiological questionnaire, underwent a medical examination including skin prick test positivity to common allergens, skin examination for eczema, and run test to assess exercise-induced asthma (EIA). Prevalence of allergies was, respectively, 25.2% for eczema, 12.9% for rhinitis, 9.9% for asthma and 25% for atopy. About 8.3% had an EIA. About 21.6% of children were exposed to maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy. Maternal smoking, in utero and later, was significantly related to lifetime wheezing (odds ratio (OR): 1.24[1.10-1.56]) and asthma (OR: 1.22[1.04-1.66]). There was no association between atopy, rhinitis, eczema and parental smoking, respectively. ETS remains a risk factor of wheezing in childhood. Counselling parents of children to quit smoking still remains a public health policy. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In Asia, limited literature has been published on the association between daily mortality and ambient air pollution. We examined the associations of daily cause-specific mortality with daily mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with a mass median aerodynamic diameter less than 10 $\mu$m (PM10) in Wuhan, China using 4 years of data (2001-2004). There are approximately 4.5 million residents in Wuhan who live in the city core area of 201 km2 where air pollution levels are higher and pollution ranges are wider than the majority of cities in the published literature. We use quasi-likelihood estimation within the context of the generalized additive models (GAMs) (natural spline (NS) models in R) to model the natural logarithm of the expected daily death counts as a function of the predictor variables. We found consistent PM10 effects on mortality with the strongest effects on lag 0 day. Every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10 daily concentration at lag 0 day was significantly associated with an increase in non-accidental (0.36%; 95% CI 0.19-0.53%), cardiovascular (0.51%; 95% CI 0.28-0.75%), stroke (0.44%; 95% CI 0.16-0.72%), cardiac (0.49%; 95% CI 0.08-0.89%), respiratory (0.71%; 95% CI 0.20-1.23%), and cardiopulmonary (0.46%; 95% CI 0.23-0.69%). In general, these effects were stronger among the elderly (≥65 years or ≥45 years) than among the young. The exploration of exposure-response relationships between PM10 and cause-specific mortality suggests the appropriateness of assuming linear relationships, where the PM10 concentration in Wuhan ranged from 24.8 to 477.8 $\mu$g/m3. We conclude that there is consistent evidence of acute effects of PM10 on cardiopulmonary mortality. A linear no threshold exposure-response relationship is suggested between PM10 and the studied cause-specific mortality. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In humans, immune development begins early in embryonic life and continues throughout the early postnatal period. Although a number of pesticides have been observed to induce developmental immunotoxicity in mice, few human studies have examined the long term effects of in utero pesticide exposure on childhood morbidity. Empirical evidence suggests that the vulnerable period for toxic insults to the developing immune system extends from early gestation to adolescence in humans and animals. Using data from the Ontario Farm Family Health Study, we examined the relationship between farm couple exposures to pesticides during pregnancy and subsequent health outcomes in their offspring, including: persistent cough or bronchitis, asthma, and allergies or hayfever. No strong associations between pesticide exposures during pregnancy and persistent cough or bronchitis, or asthma were found. There was suggestive evidence that allergies and hayfever appeared to be more common in offspring, especially male offspring, exposed to certain specific pesticides during the period of pregnancy. Nevertheless, given the indirect indicators of pesticide exposure used in this study, and the scarcity of human studies on in utero exposure to pesticides and the development of allergies and other child health outcomes, these findings serve primarlily to generate hypotheses for future research. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background: Fine particulate matter has been linked to allergies by experimental and epidemiological data having used aggregated data or concentrations provided by fixed-site monitoring stations, which may have led to misclassification of individual exposure to air pollution. Methods: A semi-individual design was employed to relate individual data on asthma and allergy of 5338 school children (10.4±0.7 years) attending 108 randomly chosen schools in 6 French cities to the concentrations of PM2.5 (fine particles with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 $\mu$m) assessed in proximity of their homes. Children underwent a medical visit including skin prick test (SPT) to common allergens, exercise-induced bronchial (EIB) reactivity and skin examination for flexural dermatitis. Their parents filled in a standardised health questionnaire. Results: After adjustment for confounders and NO2 as a potential modifier, the odds of suffering from EIB and flexural dermatitis at the period of the survey, past year atopic asthma and SPT positivity to indoor allergens were significantly increased in residential settings with PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 10 $\mu$g/m3 (WHO air quality limit values). The relationships were strengthened in long-term residents (current address for at least 8 years). Conclusions: Findings support the hypothesis that changes in allergy prevalence observed in recent decades might be partly related to interactions between traffic-related air pollution and allergens. Further longitudinal investigations are needed to corroborate such results. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Results: Statistical analysis showed a significant negative loading between CVD and meteorological variables as well as thermal comfort indices. The CVD curve was a U-shaped, showing higher value for cold stress than for heat stress. The results clearly show seasonal variations in CVD mortality rates, which were higher in winter. Meteorological variables were found to play an important role as well as through the thermal comfort indices.

abstract = {Objectives
To describe the degree of annoyance caused by air pollution and noise in pregnant women in a birth cohort; to determine the modifying factors and their relation with exposure to ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2).
Methods
The study population was 855 pregnant women in Valencia, Spain. Annoyance caused by air pollution and noise, and explanatory factors were obtained from 786 pregnant women through a questionnaire. NO2 levels were determined combining measurements at 93 points within the area of study and using geostatistical techniques (kriging).
Results
In all 7.9% of the women reported high annoyance caused by air pollution and 13.1% high annoyance caused by noise. There was a significant difference in the degree of annoyance due to both air pollution and noise depending on the area where the women lived and their working status. The degree of annoyance correlated better with measured NO2 at the municipality level (air pollution: r=0.53; noise: r=0.44) than at the individual level (air pollution and noise: r=0.21). On multivariate analysis, being a housewife, higher NO2 levels and high traffic density were associated with higher degrees of annoyance.
Conclusions
There was a high percentage of women who perceived medium–high annoyance due to noise and air pollution. Annoyance caused by environmental pollutants could lead to some psychological effects, which impair the quality of life, or even physiological ones, which affect prenatal development.},

abstract = {The goal of this study is to describe linkages between the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) air monitoring data, specifically how the linkage method affects characteristics and exposure estimates of study samples and estimated associations between exposure and health. In the USA, nationally representative health data are collected in the NHIS and annual air quality data are collected by the EPA. The linkage of these data for research is not straightforward and the choices made may introduce bias into results. The 2000–2003 NHIS and air quality data for six air pollutants were linked by residential block group and monitor location, which differ by pollutants. For each pollutant, three annual exposure variables were assigned to respondents: (1) average of all monitors in the county, (2) of monitors within a 5-mile radius of the distance between block group and monitor, and (3) within a 20-mile radius. Exposure estimates, study sample characteristics, and association between fine particle exposure and respondent-reported health status were compared for different geographic linkage methods. The results showed that study sample characteristics varied by geographic linkage method and pollutant linked. Generally, the fewer the NHIS respondents linked, the higher is the pollution exposure and lower is the percentage of non-Hispanic whites. After adjustment for sociodemographic and geographic factors, associations between fine particles and health status were generally comparable across study samples. Because exposure information is not available for all potential participants in an epidemiological study, selection effects should be considered when drawing inferences about air quality–health associations. With the current monitoring data system, the study sample is substantially reduced when linkage to multiple pollutants is performed.},

abstract = {This paper presents characterization factors (CFs) for human health effects of fine particulate (PM10) and ozone in Europe for the purpose of life cycle impact assessment. The CFs express the change in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) of European inhabitants due to a change in emissions of PM10, ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). The CF consists of an intake factor, an effect factor, and a damage factor. The intake factor was modeled as the change in population exposure to primary and secondary aerosols, and ozone due to a change in emission of a substance. This was done with the models EUTREND (aerosols) and LOTOS–EUROS (ozone). A combined human effect and damage factor, represented by the change in DALY due to a change in population intake was derived from epidemiological-based relative risks of short-term mortality, long-term mortality, and morbidity. Primary PM10 causes 260 DALYs per kton emission, while secondary aerosol formation results in CFs between 51 and 83 DALYs per kton of precursor emitted. Applying CFs for high and low stack sources separately for PM10 and SO2 life cycle emissions can lead to a better estimation of human health damage due to these pollutants. CF related to ozone formation emissions appear to be much lower (0.04 DALY per kton, calculated based on maximum daily 8-h average ozone concentration) compared to the CF for primary and secondary PM10. When calculating CF based on 24-h average ozone concentration, NMVOC causes 0.04 DALYs per kton, while the CF for NOx causing ozone formation is negative due to reactivity of ozone with NO in areas with high NOx levels (−0.12 DALYs per kton). Total European emissions of the five priority air pollutants in year 2000 are attributed to 4.2 million DALYs for the European population, which corresponds on average to 0.25 DALYs per person over a lifetime (80 years).},

Frequency domain indexes were estimated in absolute (ms2) and in normalized units (nu) (low frequencies (LF), high frequencies (HF) and low/high frequency ratio (LF/HF)) in 5min periods by standard methods. Data were transformed into natural logarithmic scale (ln). Comparisons were made between genders and positive and negative HUT subjects. LF were larger and HF were smaller in negative HUT males. Multivariate analysis with GEE models, adjusted for each index, showed a significant decrease of HRV (LFln −0.194 95% CI, −0.4509, 0.0627, and HFln −0.298 95% CI, −0.5553, −0.0401) associated to an increase in PM2.5 air pollution in positive and negative HUT subjects which was larger for HFln in outdoor environments.

abstract = {This paper evaluates the ranking of 21 priority air pollutants with three indicator schemes: environmental pressure indicator (EPI), environmental quality indicator (EQI), and human health effect indicator (HEI). The EPI and EQI compare the emissions and concentrations with the target emissions and target concentrations, respectively. The HEI comprehends the steps from cause (i.e. national emissions) to effect (i.e. human health effects), and is the total human health burden, expressed in Disability Adjusted Life Years per year of exposure (DALYsyear−1). We estimated a health burden in the Netherlands of 41×103DALYsyear−1 caused by Dutch air emissions of PM10 and its precursors in the year 2003. The burden due to 17 carcinogenic substances emitted to air, was much lower (140DALYsyear−1). In contrast, when the same substances were evaluated regarding environmental pressure and environmental quality, carbon tetrachloride (pressure) and benzo[a]pyrene (quality) were of highest importance, whereas the importance of PM10 was substantially lower. This result is remarkable, because for the majority of substances evaluated, the target concentrations and target emissions are based on preventing human health damage. The differences in relevance are explained by the different weighting of interests in the indicators. The HEI is based on concentration–response relations, whereas the EPI and EQI also depend on other, policy-based, principles and on technical feasibility. Therefore, to effectively prioritize emission reduction measures in policy-making, substances should not only be evaluated as to whether emission targets and environmental quality targets are reached, but they should be evaluated regarding their human health impact as well. In this context, the HEI is a suitable indicator to evaluate the human health impact.},

abstract = {Improved understanding of the sources of air pollution that are most harmful could aid in developing more effective measures for protecting human health. The Denver Aerosol Sources and Health (DASH) study was designed to identify the sources of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) that are most responsible for the adverse health effects of short-term exposure to PM2.5. Daily 24-h PM2.5 sampling began in July 2002 at a residential monitoring site in Denver, Colorado, using both Teflon and quartz filter samplers. Sampling is planned to continue through 2008. Chemical speciation is being carried out for mass, inorganic ionic compounds (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium), and carbonaceous components, including elemental carbon, organic carbon, temperature-resolved organic carbon fractions and a large array of organic compounds. In addition, water-soluble metals were measured daily for 12 months in 2003. A receptor-based source apportionment approach utilizing positive matrix factorization (PMF) will be used to identify PM2.5 source contributions for each 24-h period. Based on a preliminary assessment using synthetic data, the proposed source apportionment should be able to identify many important sources on a daily basis, including secondary ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate, diesel vehicle exhaust, road dust, wood combustion and vegetative debris. Meat cooking, gasoline vehicle exhaust and natural gas combustion were more challenging for PMF to accurately identify due to high detection limits for certain organic molecular marker compounds. Measurements of these compounds are being improved and supplemented with additional organic molecular marker compounds. The health study will investigate associations between daily source contributions and an array of health endpoints, including daily mortality and hospitalizations and measures of asthma control in asthmatic children. Findings from the DASH study, in addition to being of interest to policymakers, by identifying harmful PM2.5 sources may provide insights into mechanisms of PM effect.},

The aims of this work were to characterize the aerobiology of the Platanus, Acer, Salix, Quercus, Betula and Populus pollen, linking it with monthly emergency hospital admissions and to identify the different reactivity levels in sensitized patients. This information would be of great importance to evaluate the convenience of changing the inventory of pollen producer trees related to the risk of allergenic reactions. The study was conducted in Porto, Portugal, from 2005 to 2007. Airborne pollen was sampled using a Hirst-type volumetric trap. The antigenic and allergenic properties of Acer negundo, Betula pendula, Platanus occidentalis, Populus hybrida, Quercus robur and Salix babylonica pollen, collected in public gardens or sidewalks, were investigated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunological techniques using polysensitized-patient sera. Monthly hospital admissions of asthma or dyspnea related with respiratory diseases were obtained from the Emergency Room database of Hospital Geral de Santo Ant{\'{o}}nio. Tree pollen and hospital admissions were positively correlated. Tree pollen peaked in March which coincides with the hospital admissions maximum. The highest binding affinity was observed with A. negundo, S. babylonica and P. occidentalis pollen extracts and the lowest with P. hybrida. Consistently, Acer and Platanus maximum airborne pollen concentrations were observed during March attaining levels considered moderate to high risk for allergenic reactions. Prominent bands with approximately 71, 35, 31, 22, 19, 16, 14, 13 and 11kDa were revealed. A 52kDa band was shared by all analyzed sera. High levels of airborne pollen and emergency hospital admissions were related. High binding affinity of specific IgE to pollen extracts of the most abundant tree pollen present in the atmosphere was observed. Patient sera revealed multiple similar allergenic bands shared by the different extracts. This multidisciplinary approach is useful in day-to-day medical practice to help in diagnostic, therapeutic and allergy alerting system adjusting.},

The aim of this study is to investigate the association between exposure to black smoke (BS; particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <4$\mu$g/m3) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) during the first trimester of pregnancy and risk of congenital anomalies. We used a case–control study design among deliveries to mothers resident in the UK Northern health region during 1985–1990. Case data were ascertained from the population-based Northern Congenital Abnormality Survey and control data from national data on all births. Data on BS and SO2 from ambient air monitoring stations were used to average the total pollutant exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy over the daily readings from all monitors within 10km of the mother's residence. Logistic regression models estimated the association via odds ratios. A significant but weak positive association was found between nervous system anomalies and BS (OR=1.10 per increase of 1000$\mu$g/m3 total BS; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.18), but not with other anomaly subtypes. For SO2, a significant negative association was found with congenital heart disease combined and patent ductus arteriosus: OR significantly <1 for all quartiles relative to the first quartile. The relationship between SO2 levels and other anomaly subtypes was less clear cut: there were either no significant associations or a suggestion of a U-shaped relationship (OR significantly <1 for moderate compared to lowest levels, but not with high SO2 levels). Overall, maternal exposure to BS and SO2 in the Northern region had limited impact on congenital anomaly risk. Studies with detailed exposure assessment are needed to further investigate this relationship.},

abstract = {Exposure to traffic-related air pollution in urban environment is common and has been associated with adverse human health effects. In utero exposures that result in DNA damage may affect health later in life. Early effects of maternal and in utero exposures to traffic-related air pollution were assessed through the use of validated biomarkers in blood cells from mother–newborn pairs. A cross-sectional biomonitoring study with healthy pregnant women living in the Greater Copenhagen area, Denmark, was conducted. Bulky DNA adducts and micronuclei (MN) were measured in blood from 75 women and 69 umbilical cords, concurrently collected at the time of planned Caesarean section. Modeled residential traffic density, a proxy measure of traffic-related air pollution exposures, was validated by indoor levels of nitrogen dioxide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in 42 non-smoking homes. DNA adduct levels were similar and positively correlated in maternal and cord blood (1.40 vs. 1.37n/108 nucleotides; r=0.99; p<0.01). Maternal MN frequencies were significantly associated with age (p<0.01), and higher than those of the newborns (7.0 vs. 3.2 MN per 1000 binucleated cells). Adduct levels were highest among mother–newborn pairs who lived near medium-traffic-density (>400–2500vehiclekm/24h; p<0.01) places. MN frequencies among newborns from women who lived at high-traffic-density homes (>2500vehiclekm/24h) were significantly increased (p=0.02). This trend remained after adjusting for potential confounders and effect modifiers. For the first time increased bulky DNA adducts and MN in cord blood after maternal exposures to traffic-related air pollution are found, demonstrating that these transplacental environmental exposures induce DNA damage in newborns. Given that increased DNA damage early in life indicate an increased risk for adverse health effects later in life, these findings justify intervention of pregnant women.},

Overall, PM10 (usually 200-day accumulation) and ozone (3-day accumulation) were the two important predictors of outcome but their effect was not uniform across the nine cities. Many models exhibited thresholds (25–45 $\mu$m g/m3 for PM10, and 10–45 ppb for O3). Our preliminary exploratory analyses suggest that the use of a linear, no threshold, model for pollution studies is not consistent with the observed data.

abstract = {Background
Studies suggest that increases of fine particle concentrations (PM2.5) could be linked with a rise in cardiovascular disease. With approximately 25% of American adults aged 30 and older reporting having either heart disease or hypertension it is possible that exposure to air pollution could have significant public health consequences. This study examined the relationship between PM2.5 and the prevalence of self-reported hypertension and heart disease using data from a large nation-wide survey.
Study design
Adults, 30 years of age or older, who participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 1999 to 2005 were linked to annual PM2.5 data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (N=132,224). Annual air quality estimates were averaged from monitors within 20 miles of the respondent's residential block group. Respondents who reported being told they had hypertension by a health professional on two or more separate occasions were defined as hypertensive. Heart disease was defined as answering, “yes” to one or more of three NHIS questions on heart disease.
Results
A 10$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure was associated with a small elevated risk of hypertension (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00–1.10) risk of heart disease (1.08 95% CI 1.00–1.16). The association between PM2.5 and hypertension was found in non-Hispanic white adults (OR 1.10 95% CI 1.04–1.17) but not in non-Hispanic black or Hispanic adults.
Conclusions
Findings from this study complement those from other studies and indicate that PM2.5 adversely affects cardiovascular health. Our results are consistent with other studies in showing a small association between exposure to PM2.5 and cardiovascular outcomes.},

abstract = {Aerosols are harmful to human health and have both direct and indirect effects on climate. China is a major contributor to global emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), a sulfate (SO42−) precursor, organic carbon (OC), and black carbon (BC) aerosols. Although increasingly examined, the effect of present and potential future levels of these emissions on global premature mortality and climate change has not been well quantified. Through both direct radiative effects and indirect effects on clouds, SO42− and OC exert negative radiative forcing (cooling) while BC exerts positive forcing (warming). We analyze the effect of China's emissions of SO2, SO42−, OC and BC in 2000 and for three emission scenarios in 2030 on global surface aerosol concentrations, premature mortality, and radiative forcing (RF). Using global models of chemical transport (MOZART-2) and radiative transfer (GFDL RTM), and combining simulation results with gridded population data, mortality rates, and concentration–response relationships from the epidemiological literature, we estimate the contribution of Chinese aerosols to global annual premature mortality and to RF in 2000 and 2030. In 2000, we estimate these aerosols cause approximately 470 000 premature deaths in China and an additional 30 000 deaths globally. In 2030, aggressive emission controls lead to a 50% reduction in premature deaths from the 2000 level to 240 000 in China and 10 000 elsewhere, while under a high emissions scenario premature deaths increase 50% from the 2000 level to 720 000 in China and to 40 000 elsewhere. Because the negative RF from SO42− and OC is larger than the positive forcing from BC, Chinese aerosols lead to global net direct RF of −74mWm−2 in 2000 and between −15 and −97mWm−2 in 2030 depending on the emissions scenario. Our analysis indicates that increased effort to reduce greenhouse gases is essential to address climate change as China's anticipated reduction of aerosols will result in the loss of net negative radiative forcing.},

abstract = {Mortality is the most important health effect of ambient air pollution and has been studied the longest. The earliest evidence relates to fog episodes but with the development of more precise methods of investigation it is still possible to discern short-term temporal associations with daily mortality at the historically low levels of air pollution that now exist in most developed countries. Another early observation was that mortality was higher in more polluted areas. This has been confirmed by modern cohort studies that account for other potential explanations for such associations. There does not appear to be a threshold of effect within the ambient range of concentrations. Advances in the understanding of air pollution and mortality have been driven by the combined development of methods and biomedical concepts. The most influential methodological developments have been in time-series techniques and the establishment of large cohort studies, both of which are underpinned by advances in data processing and statistical analysis. On the biomedical side two important developments can be identified. One has been the application of the concept of multifactorial disease causation to explaining how air pollution may affect mortality at low levels and why thresholds are not obvious at the population level. The other has been an increasing understanding of how air pollution may plausibly have pathophysiological effects that are remote from the lung interface with ambient air. Together, these advances have had a profound influence on policies to protect public health. Throughout the history of air pollution epidemiology, mortality studies have been central and this will continue because of the widespread availability of mortality data on a large population scale and the weight that mortality carries in estimating impacts for policy development.},

abstract = {This paper presents the contribution to population exposure (PE) of regional background fine primary (PPM2.5) and secondary inorganic (SIA) particulate matter and its impact on mortality in Europe during 1997–2003 calculated with a chemistry transport model. Contributions to concentrations and PE due to emissions from shipping, Western (WEU), Eastern (EEU), and Northern Europe are compared. WEU contributes about 40% to both PPM2.5 and SIA concentrations, whereas the EEU contribution to PPM2.5 is much higher (43% of total PPM2.5) than to SIA (29% of total SIA). The population weighted average concentration (PWC) of PPM2.5 is a factor of 2.3 higher than average (non-weighted) concentrations, whereas for SIA the PWC is only a factor 1.6 higher. This is due to PPM2.5 concentrations having larger gradients and being relatively high over densely populated areas, whereas SIA is formed outside populated areas. WEU emissions contribute relatively more than EEU to PWC and mortality due to both PPM2.5 and SIA in Europe. The number of premature deaths in Europe is estimated to 301 000 per year due to PPM2.5 exposure and 245 000 due to SIA, despite 3.3 times higher average SIA concentrations. This is due to population weighting and assumed (and uncertain) higher relative risk of mortality for PPM2.5 components (2.8 times higher RR for PPM2.5). This study indicates that it might be more efficient, for the health of the European population, to decrease primary PM emissions (especially in WEU) than to decrease precursors of SIA, but more knowledge on the toxicity of different PM constituents is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.},

abstract = {Metropolitan Taipei, which is located in the subtropical area, is characterized by high population and automobile densities. For convenience, most primary schools are located near major roads. This study explores the exposure of acid aerosols for schoolchildren in areas in Taipei with different traffic densities. Acid aerosols were collected by using a honeycomb denuder filter pack sampling system (HDS). Experimental results indicated that the air pollutants were significantly correlated with traffic densities. The ambient air NO2, SO2, HNO3, NO3−, SO42−, and aerosol acidity concentrations were 31.3 ppb, 4.7 ppb, 1.3 ppb, 1.9 $\mu$g m−3, 18.5 $\mu$g m−3, and 49.5 nmol m−3 in high traffic density areas, and 6.1 ppb, 1.8 ppb, 0.9 ppb, 0.7 $\mu$g m−3, 8.8 $\mu$g m−3 and 14.7 nmol m−3 in low traffic density areas. The exposure levels of acid aerosols for schoolchildren would be higher than the measurements because the sampling height was 5 m above the ground. The SO2 levels were low (0.13–8.03 ppb) in the metropolitan Taipei. However, the SO42− concentrations were relatively high, and might be attributed to natural emissions of sulfur-rich geothermal sources. The seasonal variations of acid aerosol concentrations were also observed. The high levels of acidic particles in spring time may be attributed to the Asian dust storm and low height of the mixture layer. We conclude that automobile contributed not only the primary pollutants but also the secondary acid aerosols through the photochemical reaction. Schoolchildren were exposed to twice the acid aerosol concentrations in high traffic density areas compared to those in low traffic density areas. The incidence of allergic rhinitis of schoolchildren in the high traffic density areas was the highest in spring time. Accompanied by high temperature variation and high levels of air pollution in spring, the health risk of schoolchildren had been observed.},

These papers have mostly focused on commonly monitored air pollutants, primarily ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and various indices of perinatal health, including fetal growth, pregnancy duration, and infant mortality. While most published studies have found some marker of air pollution related to some types of perinatal outcomes, variability exists in the nature of the pollutants and outcomes associated. Synthesis of the findings has been difficult for various reasons, including differences in study design and analysis. A workshop was held in September 2007 to discuss methodological differences in the published studies as a basis for understanding differences in study findings and to identify priorities for future research, including novel approaches for existing data. Four broad topic areas were considered: confounding and effect modification, spatial and temporal exposure variations, vulnerable windows of exposure, and multiple pollutants. Here we present a synopsis of the methodological issues and challenges in each area and make recommendations for future study. Two key recommendations include: (1) parallel analyses of existing data sets using a standardized methodological approach to disentangle true differences in associations from methodological differences among studies; and (2) identification of animal studies to inform important mechanistic research gaps. This work is of critical public health importance because of widespread exposure and because perinatal outcomes are important markers of future child and adult health.},

abstract = {Changes over recent decades in outdoor concentrations of air pollutants are well documented. However, the impacts of air pollution on an individual's health actually relate not to these outdoor concentrations but to their personal exposure in the different locations in which they spend time. Assessing how personal exposures differ from outdoor concentrations, and how they have changed over recent decades, is challenging. This review focuses on the exposure of children, since they are a particularly sensitive group. Much of children's time is spent indoors, and childhood exposure is closely related to concentrations in the home, at school, and in transport. For this reason, children's personal exposures to air pollutants differ significantly from both those of adults and from outdoor concentrations. They depend on a range of factors, including urbanisation, energy use, building design, travel patterns, and activity profiles; analysis of these factors can identify a wider range of policy measures to reduce children's exposure than direct emission control. There is a very large variation in personal exposure between individual children, caused by differences in building design, indoor and outdoor sources, and activity patterns. Identifying groups of children with high personal exposure, and their underlying causes, is particularly important in regions of the world where emissions are increasing, but there are limited resources for environmental and health protection. Although the science of personal exposure assessment, with the associated measurement and modelling techniques, has developed to maturity in North America and western Europe over the last 50 years, there is an urgent need to apply this science in other parts of the world where the effects of air pollution are now much more serious.},

abstract = {Our primary purpose was to assess sex-specific fetal growth reduction in newborns exposed prenatally to fine particulate matter. Only women 18–35 years of age, who claimed to be non-smokers, with singleton pregnancies, without illicit drug use and HIV infection, free from chronic diseases were eligible for the study. A total of 481 enrolled pregnant women who gave birth between 37 and 43 weeks of gestation were included in the study. Prenatal personal exposure to fine particles over 48h during the second trimester was measured using personal monitors. To evaluate the relationship between the level of PM2.5 measured over 48h in the second trimester of pregnancy with those in the first and the third trimesters, a series of repeated measurements in each trimester was carried out in a random subsample of 85 pregnant women. We assessed the effect of PM2.5 exposure on the birth outcomes (weight, length and head circumference at birth) by multivariable regression models, controlling for potential confounders (maternal education, gestational age, parity, maternal height and prepregnancy weight, sex of infant, prenatal environmental tobacco smoke, and season of birth). Birth outcomes were associated positively with gestational age, parity, maternal height and prepregnancy weight, but negatively with the level of prenatal PM2.5 exposure. Overall average increase in gestational period of prenatal exposure to fine particles by about 30$\mu$g/m3, i.e., from 25th percentile (23.4$\mu$g/m3) to 75th percentile (53.1$\mu$g/m3) brought about an average birth weight deficit of 97.2g (95% CI: −201, 6.6) and length at birth of 0.7cm (95% CI: −1.36, −0.04). The corresponding exposure lead to birth weight deficit in male newborns of 189g (95% CI: −34.2, −343) in comparison to 17g in female newborns; the deficit of length at birth in male infants amounted to 1.1cm (95% CI: −0.11, −2.04). We found a significant interrelationship between self-reported ETS and PM2.5, however, none of the models showed a significant interaction of both variables. The joint effect of various levels of PM2.5 and ETS on birth outcomes showed the significant deficit only for the categories of exposure with higher component of PM2.5. Concluding, the results of the study suggest that observed deficits in birth outcomes are rather attributable to prenatal PM2.5 exposure and not to environmental tobacco smoke. The study also provided evidence that male fetuses are more sensitive to prenatal PM2.5 exposure and this should persuade policy makers to consider birth outcomes by gender separately while setting air pollution guidelines.},

abstract = {A major issue in air pollution epidemiology is whether the associations that are found in the statistical analyses on the health effects of air pollution reflect real causal associations of single components or mixtures thereof, or just reflect statistical associations that are mainly the result of the high correlation between the separate components, one of them being the true causal factor. In a previous analysis on the relationship between daily SO2 levels and daily mortality in The Netherlands [Buringh, E., Fischer, P., Hoek, G., 2000. Is SO2 a causative factor for the PM-associated mortality risks in The Netherlands? Inhal. Toxicol. 12 (Suppl. 1), 55–60.], it was shown that the statistical significant association between daily variation in SO2 and daily mortality did not reflect a causal relation. Black Smoke levels in The Netherlands have decreased 4-fold during the 34 years in the period 1972–2006 (annual average from 27$\mu$gm−3 to 6$\mu$gm−3). This large decrease in concentrations enabled us to use the same approach for this component as was done earlier for SO2 to assess whether a decreasing trend in Black Smoke levels in The Netherlands is associated with an increasing trend in mortality relative risks or not. We used daily averaged Black Smoke (BS) data from 1972 to 2006. In the first two decades (1970–1990) only sparse data were available. Based on the availability of the data, we selected data from 1972 to 1974 and from 1982 to 1984 because during these two periods continuous daily measurement series were available. For the later years (1989–2006) data covering the whole of The Netherlands were available, giving a total of 24 years of daily data. Data on daily total mortality counts (excluding external causes), cardiovascular mortality and respiratory mortality for the whole population of The Netherlands were analyzed with regard to daily Black Smoke levels using generalized additive Poisson regression models (GAM). Period specific relative risk estimates were compared and differences in estimates between periods were evaluated. We found no consistent increase in relative risks for daily total and cause-specific mortality over time, despite the decreasing trend in the Black Smoke levels in The Netherlands. Average relative risks for total mortality varied over the different periods from 0.997 per 10$\mu$gm−3 daily Black Smoke to 1.010 per 10$\mu$gm−3. Average relative risks for cardiovascular mortality varied from 0.988 per 10$\mu$gm−3 to 1.010 per 10$\mu$gm−3 and for respiratory mortality from 1.000 to 1.010 per 10$\mu$gm−3. For weekly averaged concentrations the average relative risks for total mortality varied over the different periods from 1.004 per 10$\mu$gm−3 Black Smoke to 1.018 per 10$\mu$gm−3. Average relative risks for cardiovascular mortality varied from 1.003 per 10$\mu$gm−3 to 1.016 per 10 $\mu$gm−3 and for respiratory mortality from 1.000 to 1.050 per 10$\mu$gm−3. The result of our analyses suggests that Black Smoke cannot be excluded as a potential causal agent because relative risks over time show no increasing trend despite the decreasing trend in Black Smoke concentrations.},

abstract = {Animal studies have suggested that fine particulate matter (PM) can translocate from the upper respiratory tract to the brain and cause brain inflammation. Brain inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Hypothesizing therefore that long-term exposure to fine PM might contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the objective of this study was to investigate the association between exposure to fine PM and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which is associated with a high risk of progression to AD. A study group of 399 women aged 68–79 years who lived for more than 20 years at the same residential address has been assessed for long-term exposure to PM and tested for MCI. The exposure assessment comprised background concentration of PM10 and traffic-related PM indicated by the distance of the residential address to the next busy road. The women were assessed for MCI by a battery of several neuropsychological tests and their odor identification ability. Consistent effects of traffic-related air pollution exposure on test performances including a dose–response relation were found. The associations were adjusted for potential confounders using regression analysis. These results indicate that chronic exposure to traffic-related PM may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.},

abstract = {A prior study in New York City observed that airborne concentrations of three metals found in steel – iron, manganese, and chromium – are more than 100 times higher in the subway system than in aboveground air. To investigate the potential for health effects of exposure at these levels, we conducted a pilot study of subway workers comparing personal exposures to steel dust with biomarkers of metal exposure, oxidative stress, and DNA damage in blood and urine samples. Workers wore a personal air sampler operating at 4L/m for one to three work shifts with blood and urine samples collected at the end of the final shift. We found that PM2.5 exposures varied among subway workers on the basis of job title and job activity. The subway workers' mean time-weighted PM2.5 exposure was 52$\mu$g/m3, with a median of 27$\mu$g/m3, and a range of 6–469$\mu$g/m3. The observed concentrations of PM2.5, iron, manganese, and chromium fell well below occupational standards. Biomarker concentrations among the 39 subway workers were compared with a group of 11 bus drivers, and a group of 25 suburban office workers. Concentrations of DNA–protein crosslinks and chromium in plasma were significantly higher in subway workers than in bus drivers, but no significant difference was observed for these biomarkers between subway workers and office workers. Urinary isoprostane concentrations were significantly correlated with the number of years working in the subway system, and were detected at higher, though not significantly higher, concentrations in subway workers than in bus drivers or office workers. At the group level, there was no consistent pattern of biomarker concentrations among subway workers significantly exceeding those of the bus drivers and office workers. At the individual level, steel dust exposure was not correlated with any of the biomarkers measured.},

abstract = {This research evaluates commuter exposure to particulate matter during pre-journey commute segments for passengers waiting at bus stops by investigating 840 min of simultaneous exposure levels, both inside and outside seven bus shelters in Buffalo, New York. A multivariate regression model is used to estimate the relation between exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5 measured in $\mu$g m−3) and three vectors of determinants: time and location, physical setting and placement, and environmental factors. Four determinants have a statistically significant effect on particulate matter: time of day, passengers' waiting location, land use near the bus shelter, and the presence of cigarette smoking at the bus shelter. Model results suggest that exposure to PM2.5 inside a bus shelter is 2.63 $\mu$g m−3 (or 18 percent) higher than exposure outside a bus shelter, perhaps due in part to the presence of cigarette smoking. Morning exposure levels are 6.51 $\mu$g m−3 (or 52 percent) higher than afternoon levels. Placement of bus stops can affect exposure to particulate matter for those waiting inside and outside of shelters: air samples at bus shelters located in building canyons have higher particulate matter than bus shelters located near open space.},

abstract = {This study evaluates the health risks in megacities in terms of mortality and morbidity due to air pollution. A new spreadsheet model, Risk of Mortality/Morbidity due to Air Pollution (Ri-MAP), is used to estimate the excess numbers of deaths and illnesses. By adopting the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline concentrations for the air pollutants SO2, NO2 and total suspended particles (TSP), concentration-response relationships and a population attributable-risk proportion concept are employed. Results suggest that some megacities like Los Angeles, New York, Osaka Kobe, Sao Paulo and Tokyo have very low excess cases in total mortality from these pollutants. In contrast, the approximate numbers of cases is highest in Karachi (15,000/yr) characterized by a very high concentration of total TSP (∼670$\mu$gm−3). Dhaka (7000/yr), Beijing (5500/yr), Karachi (5200/yr), Cairo (5000/yr) and Delhi (3500/yr) rank highest with cardiovascular mortality. The morbidity (hospital admissions) due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) follows the tendency of cardiovascular mortality. Dhaka and Karachi lead the rankings, having about 2100/yr excess cases, while Osaka-Kobe (∼20/yr) and Sao Paulo (∼50/yr) are at the low end of all megacities considered. Since air pollution is increasing in many megacities, and our database of measured pollutants is limited to the period up to 2000 and does not include all relevant components (e.g. O3), these numbers should be interpreted as lower limits. South Asian megacities most urgently need improvement of air quality to prevent excess mortality and morbidity due to exceptionally high levels of air pollution. The risk estimates obtained from Ri-MAP present a realistic baseline evaluation for the consequences of ambient air pollution in comparison to simple air quality indices, and can be expanded and improved in parallel with the development of air pollution monitoring networks.},

abstract = {During the June 1996 eruption of Mt Ruapehu, New Zealand, traces of fine particulate volcanic ash were observed in or near the cities of Hamilton and Auckland, 166–282 km from the volcano. Although no health impacts in these cities were attributed to the eruption, hospital records at both cities for the following month show the highest rates of respiratory mortality for the 1990s. Alternative explanations for this increase in respiratory mortality were investigated, including urban air pollution, adverse weather conditions and influenza. Comparable records from Wellington city, assumed to be outside the zone of ash dispersal, were used as a ‘control'. Our results suggest that at Hamilton, where non-volcanic factors can largely be eliminated as making a significant contribution, diffuse volcanic ashfall may have been an important factor in respiratory mortality during the weeks following the eruption. At Auckland, further away from the volcano but with a much larger population than Hamilton, a case for a weaker volcanic contribution can be made, but is more equivocal because of coincidentally high urban air pollution and cold, stable weather. These findings support the concept that diffuse fine volcanic ash poses a risk to respiratory health at greater distances from an eruption than is currently perceived. This is because the finest ‘respirable' fraction of erupted material with potentially hazardous physico-chemical properties is likely to be ejected highest into the atmosphere and dispersed the greatest distance. If significant amounts reach large cities, then large numbers of individuals may be at risk, especially those already suffering poor respiratory health. This work has important implications for environmental health and hazard management in New Zealand and in other regions that may be susceptible to a similar volcanic threat.},

abstract = {Background
Explorations of interactions between air pollution and seasonal changes have represented one approach in examining the consequences of global warming. However, only a few studies have focused on evaluating the effects of seasonal air pollution using data on both morbidity and mortality in Asia.
Method
We examined the associations between PM10 concentrations and mortality and hospital admissions in Seoul, Korea for the periods 2000–2006 and 2001–2006. We employed a temperature-matched case-crossover design, where reference periods matched case days in regard to temperature (same rounded to degrees celsius (°C)), month, and year.
Results
A total of 238,826 deaths were identified, along with 98,570 and 93,553 inpatient admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, respectively. We found that the association with PM10 and mortality/morbidity increased during the summer. During the study period, 10$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with the increase in mortality by 0.28% (95% confidence interval: 0.12, 0.44), 0.51% (0.19, 0.83), and 0.59% (–0.08, 1.26) for non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory causes. 10$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10 was also associated with increase in hospitalization from cardiovascular and respiratory causes by 0.77% (0.53, 1.01) and 1.19% (0.94, 1.44). In the summer, the increase in mortality and hospitalization was 0.57% (0.20, 0.93), 0.64% (–0.10, 1.38), 0.50% (–1.02, 2.05), 1.52% (0.89, 2.16), and 1.55% (0.87, 2.22).
Conclusions
This study provides evidence that the effect of PM10 on mortality and morbidity varies with season and increases during the summer season.},

abstract = {Sulfur dioxide (SO2) has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity, but only few studies were conducted in Asian countries. Previous studies suggest that SO2 may have adverse health effects independent of other pollutants. In the Public Health and Air Pollution in Asia (PAPA) project, the short-term associations between ambient sulfur dioxide (SO2) and daily mortality were examined in Bangkok, Thailand, and three Chinese cities: Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Wuhan. Poisson regression models incorporating natural spline smoothing functions were used to adjust for seasonality and other time-varying covariates. Effect estimates were obtained for each city and then for the cities combined. The impact of alternative model specifications, such as lag structure of pollutants and degree of freedom (df) for time trend, on the estimated effects of SO2 were also examined. In both individual-city and combined analysis, significant effects of SO2 on total non-accidental and cardiopulmonary mortality were observed. An increase of 10$\mu$g/m3 of 2-day moving average concentrations of SO2 corresponded to 1.00% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75–1.24], 1.09% (95% CI, 0.71–1.47), and 1.47% (95% CI, 0.85–2.08) increase of total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, respectively, in the combined analysis. Sensitivity analyzes suggested that these findings were generally insensitive to alternative model specifications. After adjustment for PM10 or O3, the effect of SO2 remained significant in three Chinese cities. However, adjustment for NO2 diminished the associations and rendered them statistically insignificant in all four cities. In conclusion, ambient SO2 concentration was associated with daily mortality in these four Asian cities. These associations may be attributable to SO2 serving as a surrogate of other substances. Our findings suggest that the role of outdoor exposure to SO2 should be investigated further in this region.},

abstract = {Visibility in Hong Kong has deteriorated significantly over 40 years with visibility below 8km in the absence of fog, mist, or precipitation, increasing from 6.6 days in 1968 to 54.1 days in 2007. We assessed the short-term mortality effects of daily loss of visibility. During 1996–2006, we obtained mortality data for non-accidental and cardiorespiratory causes, visibility recorded as visual range in kilometers, temperature, and relative humidity from an urban observatory, and concentrations of four criteria pollutants. A generalized additive Poisson regression model with penalized cubic regression splines was fitted to control for time variant covariates. For non-accidental mortality, an interquartile range (IQR) of 6.5km decrease in visibility at lag0–1 days was associated with an excess risk (ER%) [95% CI] of 1.13 [0.49, 1.76] for all ages and 1.37 [0.65, 2.09] for ages 65 years and over; for cardiovascular mortality of 1.31 [0.13, 2.49] for all ages, and 1.72 [0.44, 3.00] for ages 65 years and over; and for respiratory mortality of 1.92 [0.49, 3.35] for all ages and 1.76 [0.28, 3.25] for ages 65 years and over. The estimated ER% for daily mortality derived from both visibility and air pollutant data were comparable in terms of magnitude, lag pattern, and exposure–response relationships especially when using particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10$\mu$m to predict the mortality associated with visibility. Visibility provides a useful proxy for the assessment of environmental health risks from ambient air pollutants and a valid approach for the assessment of the public health impacts of air pollution and the benefits of air quality improvement measures in developing countries where pollutant monitoring data are scarce.},

abstract = {Smoking bans often exempt casinos, exposing occupants to fine particles (PM2.5) from secondhand smoke. We quantified the relative contributions to PM2.5 from both secondhand smoke and infiltrating outdoor sources in US casinos. We measured real-time PM2.5, particulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PPAH), and carbon dioxide (CO2) (as an index of ventilation rate) inside and outside 8 casinos in Reno, Nevada. We combined these data with data from previous studies, yielding a total of 66 US casinos with smoking in California, Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, developing PM2.5 frequency distributions, with 3 nonsmoking casinos for comparison. Geometric means for PM2.5 were 53.8$\mu$g/m3 (range 18.5–205$\mu$g/m3) inside smoking casinos, 4.3$\mu$g/m3 (range 0.26–29.7$\mu$g/m3) outside those casinos, and 3.1$\mu$g/m3 (range 0.6–9$\mu$g/m3) inside 3 nonsmoking casinos. In a subset of 21 Reno and Las Vegas smoking casinos, PM2.5 in gaming areas averaged 45.2$\mu$g/m3 (95% CI, 37.7–52.7$\mu$g/m3); adjacent nonsmoking casino restaurants averaged 27.2$\mu$g/m3 (95% CI, 17.5–36.9$\mu$g/m3), while PM2.5 outside the casinos averaged 3.9$\mu$g/m3 (95% CI, 2.5–5.3$\mu$g/m3). For a subset of 10 Nevada and Pennsylvania smoking casinos, incremental (indoor–outdoor) PM2.5 was correlated with incremental PPAH (R2=0.79), with ventilation rate-adjusted smoker density (R2=0.73), and with smoker density (R2=0.60), but not with ventilation rates (R2=0.15). PPAH levels in 8 smoking casinos in 3 states averaged 4 times outdoors. The nonsmoking casinos' PM2.5 (n=3) did not differ from outdoor levels, nor did their PPAH (n=2). Incremental PM2.5 from secondhand smoke in approximately half the smoking casinos exceeded a level known to produce cardiovascular morbidity in nonsmokers after less than 2h of exposure, posing acute health risks to patrons and workers.

abstract = {Background
Daily variations in the levels of air pollution are well known to be associated with daily variations in mortality counts. Given the large number of time-series studies, there is little need for simple replication of these results in additional locations. However, additional analyses of time-series data might be useful in elucidating remaining questions on the role of air pollution on mortality.
Objectives
Because of ongoing issues related to causality, changing toxicity, the difficulty in isolating the independent effects of individual pollutants, the availability of new methods to detect effect thresholds, and questions about the extent to which effects are restricted to frail members of the population, additional analyses of time-series data might be helpful in addressing these issues. We show an example where additional time-series analyses can be helpful in elucidating specific questions in the field of air pollution epidemiology.
Methods
We analysed daily mortality and air pollution data using Poisson regression in generalised additive models. Air pollution data for the overall period 1992–2006 and for four different periods were analysed to assess the overall risk estimates for the whole period and to assess variability over time for the different effect estimates.
Results and Conclusion
We found some statistically significant upward trends, but this was only the case for a few associations without a consistent pattern over the cause-specific deaths. Whether these findings are consistent over time or whether our findings are merely the result of statistical chance can only be elucidated by continuation of monitoring of the relative risks over time in the future. Although these results may indicate that both photochemical and particulate matter air pollution might have become more toxic, the lack of a clear pattern in the results makes these conclusions speculative.},

abstract = {The total element concentration and the chemical fractionation of 18 elements (Al, As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sr, Ti, V, Zn) in total suspended particulate matter (TSP) from Beijing, China, were studied for a period of three years (July 2005–May 2008, n=35). Additionally, particulate matter smaller than 2.5$\mu$m (PM2.5) was included in the study (February 2005–September 2007, n=32). A chemical sequential extraction scheme according to Fern{\'{a}}ndez Espinosa et al. (2002) was applied to assess the speciation and potential mobility of the elements. Four different fractions were distinguished, which can be classified as: (f1) water-extractable, (f2) bound to carbonates, oxides and reducible metals, (f3) bound to organic matter, oxidisable and sulfidic metals, and (f4) residual fraction. The chemical speciation results illustrated that potential toxic metals like Zn (41%), Cd (40%), Mn (32%), and As (29%) were detectable to a high percentage in the water-soluble fraction (f1) of TSP samples and consequently are especially harmful to the environment and exposed people. Lead and Cu in TSP samples showed highest extractability in fraction f2 (53% and 23%, respectively) and can also be considered as mobile with a negative impact on the environment and the human health. Fine particles (PM2.5) showed comparable results with sometimes higher percentages in the highly mobile fraction f1, for example for As (52%). Anthropogenic sources, such as industry and traffic, played an important role for overall atmospheric pollution throughout the year. Additionally, these more or less constant emissions were superimposed by seasonal sources, especially coal combustion in winter and geogenic dust in spring. Coal combustion proved to be a source especially relevant for the toxic and mobile elements Cd, As and Pb. The study illustrated that special attention has to be taken to the mentioned elements and their related sources for health impact assessments and when planning mitigation measures for urban atmospheric pollution and for providing a sustainable development of cities and megacities.},

The effects of prenatal exposure to environmental levels of dioxins on immune function during infancy have not been clarified, although dioxins induce immunosuppression in offspring of animals. Moreover, human studies have not assessed the effects of gender- or congener-specific differences. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between dioxin levels in maternal blood and the risk of infection and allergies in infancy. We examined 364 mothers and their infants enrolled in a Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health between 2002 and 2005 in Sapporo, Japan. Relevant information was collected from a baseline questionnaire during pregnancy, medical records at delivery, and a follow-up questionnaire when the child was 18 months of age that assessed development of allergies and infections in infancy. Dioxin-like compound levels in maternal blood were measured with high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. Relatively higher levels of polychlorinated dibenzofuran were associated with a significantly increased risk of otitis media, especially among male infants (odds ratio=2.5, 95% confidence interval=1.1–5.9). Relatively higher levels of 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran were also associated with a significantly increased risk of otitis media (odds ratio=5.3, 95% confidence interval=1.5–19). However, we observed a weak association between dioxin-like compound levels and allergic symptoms in infancy. At environmental levels, prenatal exposure to dioxin-like compounds may alter immune function and increase the risk of infections in infancy, especially among males. The compound 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran may be responsible for this.},

abstract = {The “Provence Alpes C{\^{o}}te d'Azur” (PACA) region, in the South East of France, is one of Europe's regions most influenced by the atmospheric pollution. During the last 15 years, the industrial emissions decrease caused an evolution of the atmospheric pollution nature. Nowadays, atmospheric pollution is more and more influenced by the road traffic, the dominating pollution source in urban zones for the PACA region. Combined with this intense road traffic, the strong hot season of the Mediterranean climate contributes to the region bad air quality; it is known to be one of the worse in Europe. The recognized air pollution effects over public health include increased risk of hospital admissions and mortality by respiratory or cardiovascular diseases. The combination of these serious pollution related health hazards with senior and children vulnerabilities leads to serious sanitary concerns. Over the 1990–2005 period, we obtained, using the non-parametric Mann–Kendall test from annual mortality dataset (C{\'{e}}piDC), decreasing trends for Asthma (−5.00%year−1), Cardiovascular (−0.73%year−1), Ischemic (−0.69%year−1) and cerebrovascular diseases (−3.10%year−1). However, for “Other heart diseases” (+0.10%year−1) and “Respiratory” (+0.10%year−1) an increase was observed. The development of an adequate tool to understand impacts of pollution levels is of utmost importance. Different pollutants have different health endpoints, information may be lost through the use of a single index consequently, in this study we present the modified formula of air quality index, based on Cairncross's concept the Aggregate Risk Index (ARI). ARI is based on the relative risk of the well-established increased daily mortality, or morbidity, enabling an assessment of additive effects of short-term exposure to the main air pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, SO2, O3 and NO2 in order to account for the reality of the multiple exposures impacts of chemical agents. The ARI, developed per pathology, takes into account the possible adverse effects associated with the coexistence of all pollutants. This index will enable to communicate the health risks associated, from modelled or monitored pollutant concentrations, to the general population. The second step will consist in the construction of a prediction model of this sanitary index.},

However, longitudinal investigation of the effects of traffic-related exposures during early childhood is limited. We examined associations of residential proximity and density of traffic and stationary sources of air pollution with wheeze, asthma, and immunoglobulin (Ig) E among New York City children between birth and age 5 years. Subjects included 593 Dominican and African American participants from the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health cohort. Prenatally, through age 5 years, residential and respiratory health data were collected every 3–6 months. At ages 2, 3, and 5 years, serum IgE was measured. Spatial data on the proximity and density of roadways and built environment were collected for a 250m buffer around subjects' homes. Associations of wheeze, asthma, total IgE, and allergen-specific IgE with prenatal, earlier childhood, and concurrent exposures to air pollution sources were analyzed using generalized estimating equations or logistic regression. In repeated measures analyses, concurrent residential density of four-way intersections was associated significantly with wheeze (odds ratio: 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.57). Age 1 exposures also were associated with wheeze at subsequent ages. Concurrent proximity to highway was associated more strongly with total IgE (ratio of the geometric mean levels: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.42) than were prenatal or earlier childhood exposures. Positive associations also were observed between percent commercial building area and asthma, wheeze, and IgE and between proximity to stationary sources of air pollution and asthma. Longitudinal investigation suggests that among Dominican and African American children living in Northern Manhattan and South Bronx during ages 0–5 years, residence in neighborhoods with high density of traffic and industrial facilities may contribute to chronic respiratory morbidity, and concurrent, prenatal, and earlier childhood exposures may be important. These findings may have broad implications for other urban populations that commonly have high asthma prevalence and exposure to a high density of traffic and stationary air pollution sources.},

abstract = {Background
Urban air pollutants are associated with cardiovascular events. Traffic controllers are at high risk for pollution exposure during outdoor work shifts.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between air pollution and systemic blood pressure in traffic controllers during their work shifts.
Methods
This cross-sectional study enrolled 19 male traffic controllers from Santo Andr{\'{e}} city (S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil) who were 30–60 years old and exposed to ambient air during outdoor work shifts. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were measured every 15min by an Ambulatory Arterial Blood Pressure Monitoring device. Hourly measurements (lags of 0–5h) and the moving averages (2–5h) of particulate matter (PM10), ozone (O3) ambient concentrations and the acquired daily minimum temperature and humidity means from the S{\~{a}}o Paulo State Environmental Agency were correlated with both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Statistical methods included descriptive analysis and linear mixed effect models adjusted for temperature, humidity, work periods and time of day.
Results
Interquartile increases of PM10 (33$\mu$g/m3) and O3 (49$\mu$g/m3) levels were associated with increases in all arterial pressure parameters, ranging from 1.06 to 2.53mmHg. PM10 concentration was associated with early effects (lag 0), mainly on systolic blood pressure. However, O3 was weakly associated most consistently with diastolic blood pressure and with late cumulative effects.
Conclusions
Santo Andr{\'{e}} traffic controllers presented higher blood pressure readings while working their outdoor shifts during periods of exposure to ambient pollutant fluctuations. However, PM10 and O3 induced cardiovascular effects demonstrated different time courses and end-point behaviors and probably acted through different mechanisms.},

Extreme air pollution events due to bushfire smoke and dust storms are expected to increase as a consequence of climate change, yet little has been published about their population health impacts. We examined the association between air pollution events and mortality in Sydney from 1997 to 2004.
Methods
Events were defined as days for which the 24h city-wide concentration of PM10 exceeded the 99th percentile. All events were researched and categorised as being caused by either smoke or dust. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression modelling adjusted for influenza epidemics, same day and lagged temperature and humidity. Reported odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals are for mortality on event days compared with non-event days. The contribution of elevated average temperatures to mortality during smoke events was explored.
Results
There were 52 event days, 48 attributable to bushfire smoke, six to dust and two affected by both. Smoke events were associated with a 5% increase in non-accidental mortality at a lag of 1 day OR (95% confidence interval (CI)) 1.05 (95%CI: 1.00–1.10). When same day temperature was removed from the model, additional same day associations were observed with non-accidental mortality OR 1.05 (95%CI: 1.00–1.09), and with cardiovascular mortality OR (95%CI) 1.10 (95%CI: 1.00–1.20). Dust events were associated with a 15% increase in non-accidental mortality at a lag of 3 days, OR (95%CI) 1.16 (95%CI: 1.03–1.30).
Conclusions
The magnitude and temporal patterns of association with mortality were different for smoke and dust events. Public health advisories during bushfire smoke pollution episodes should include advice about hot weather in addition to air pollution.},

Municipal solid waste landfills are sources of air pollution that may affect the health and quality of life of neighboring communities.
Objectives
To investigate health and quality of life concerns of neighbors related to landfill air pollution.
Methods
Landfill neighbors were enrolled and kept twice-daily diaries for 14d about odor intensity, alteration of daily activities, mood states, and irritant and other physical symptoms between January and November 2009. Concurrently, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) air measurements were recorded every 15-min. Relationships between H2S, odor, and health outcomes were evaluated using conditional fixed effects regression models.
Results
Twenty-three participants enrolled and completed 878 twice-daily diary entries. H2S measurements were recorded over a period of 80d and 1-h average H2S=0.22ppb (SD=0.27; range: 0–2.30ppb). Landfill odor increased 0.63 points (on 5-point Likert-type scale) for every 1ppb increase in hourly average H2S when the wind was blowing from the landfill towards the community (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.29, 0.91). Odor was strongly associated with reports of alteration of daily activities (odds ratio (OR)=9.0; 95% CI: 3.5, 23.5), negative mood states (OR=5.2; 95% CI: 2.8, 9.6), mucosal irritation (OR=3.7; 95% CI=2.0, 7.1) and upper respiratory symptoms (OR=3.9; 95% CI: 2.2, 7.0), but not positive mood states (OR=0.6; 95% CI: 0.2, 1.5) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (OR=1.0; 95% CI: 0.4, 2.6).

abstract = {The Talamanca County in Costa Rica has large-scale banana and small-scale plantain production, probably causing pesticide exposure in indigenous children. We explored to what extent different community actors are aware of children's pesticide hazards and how their awareness related to socio-economical and cultural conditions. Methods comprised eight focus groups with fathers and mothers separately, 27 semi-structured interviews to key actors, and field observations. As a whole, the indigenous plantain farmers and banana plantation workers had some general knowledge of pesticides concerning crop protection, but little on acute health effects, and hardly any on exposure routes and pathways, and chronic effects. People expressed vague ideas about pesticide risks. Inter-community differences were related to pesticide technologies used in banana and plantain production, employment status on a multinational plantation versus smallholder status, and gender. Compared to formalized practices on transnational company plantations, where workers reported to feel protected, pesticide handling by plantain smallholders was not perceived as hazardous and therefore no safety precautions were applied. Large-scale monoculture was perceived as one of the most important problems leading to pesticide risks in Talamanca on banana plantations, and also on neighboring small plantain farms extending into large areas. Plantain farmers have adopted use of highly toxic pesticides following banana production, but in conditions of extreme poverty. Aerial spraying in banana plantations was considered by most social actors a major determinant of exposure for the population living nearby these plantations, including vulnerable children. We observed violations of legally established aerial spraying distances. Economic considerations were most mentioned as the underlying reason for the pesticide use: economic needs to obtain the production quantity and quality, and pressure to use pesticides by other economic agents such as middlemen. Risk perceptions were modulated by factors such as people's tasks and positions in the production process, gender, and people's possibilities to define their own social conditions (more fatalistic perceptions among banana workers). The challenge for the future is to combine these insights into improved health risk assessment and management that is culturally adequate for each particular community and agricultural context.},

Air pollution data, collected at 113 sites (spread across Delhi and its neighboring areas) from July–December 2003, were used to compute exposure at the place of residence of 3989 subjects. A socio-economic and respiratory health survey was administered in 1576 households. This survey collected time-use, residence histories, demographic information, and direct measurements of lung function with subjects. The optimal interpolation methods were used to link air pollution and respiratory health data at the place of their residence. Resident histories, in combination with secondary data, were used to impute cumulative exposure prior to the air-quality interventions, and the effects of recent air quality measures on lung function were then evaluated. Three important findings emerge from the analysis. First, the interventions were associated with a significant improvement in respiratory health. Second, the effect of these interventions varied significantly by gender and income. Third, consistent with a causal interpretation of these results, effects were the strongest among those individuals who spend a disproportionate share of their time out-of-doors.},

abstract = {30 re-suspended dust samples were collected from building surfaces of an oilfield city, then re-suspended through PM2.5, PM10 and PM100 inlets and analyzed for 10 metals including V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd and Pb by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy. Metals concentrations in different fractions and locations were studied. Metals sources were identified by cluster and primary component analysis. The potential risk to human health was assessed by human exposure model. Results showed that Zn, Mn, Pb and Cu were higher in all the three fractions. V, Cr, Mn and Co ranged close to the background values of Chinese soil indicating that they were mainly from crustal materials. Concentrations of Zn, Mn, Pb, V, Cr, Ni, Co and Cd were higher in old district than that in new district for the three fractions. The PM2.5/PM10, PM10/PM100 and PM2.5/PM100 ratios were higher for Zn, Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, As and Cr (all higher than 1.0), and lower for Co, Mn and V (all less than or close to 1.0) which meant that anthropologic sources associated metals were more easily accumulated in finer particles than metals from crustal materials. Spatial variations indicated that the ten metals peaked at surroundings near railway station, gas stations, industrial boilers and machine manufacturing plant implying the influence of local vehicle emission, fossil fuel combustion and industrial activities as well as crustal materials which was verified by cluster analysis and primary component analysis results. Ingestion of dust particles appeared to be the main route of exposure to re-suspended dust. Hazard Indexes of As were both highest for children and adult which could be a potential threat to human health for non-cancer effect and it also exhibited the highest values for cancer effect as 1.01E-06, 7.04E-07 and 7.21E-07 for PM2.5, PM10 and PM100, respectively.},

abstract = {Insight into the mechanisms by which ambient air particulate matter mediates adverse health effects is needed to provide biological plausibility to epidemiological studies demonstrating an association between PM10 exposure and increased morbidity and mortality. In vitro studies of the effects of air pollution on human cells help to establish conditions for the analysis of cause–effect relationships. One of the major challenges is to test native atmosphere in its complexity, rather than the various components individually. We have developed an in vitro system in which human monocyte-macrophage U937 cells are directly exposed to filters containing different amounts of PM10 collected in the city of Rome. Transcriptional profiling obtained after short exposure (1h) of cells to a filter containing 1666$\mu$g PM10 (77.6$\mu$g/cm2) using a macroarray panel of 1176 genes reveals a significant change in the mRNA level (>2 fold) for 87 genes relative to cells exposed to a control filter. Overall, 9 out of 87 modulated genes were annotated as “lung cancer”. qRT-PCR confirmed the induction of relevant genes involved in DNA repair and apoptosis, specifically: ERCC1, TDG, DAD1 and MCL1. In cells exposed for 10min, 1h and 3h to different amounts of PM10, transcription of TNF$\alpha$ and TRAP1, which code for a key pro-inflammatory cytokine and a mitochondrial protein involved in cell protection from oxidative stress, respectively, was shown to be modulated in a time-dependent, but not a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these data indicate that it is possible to analyze the effects of untreated particulate matter on human cells by the direct-exposure approach we have developed, possibly providing new clues to traffic-related health hazard.},

The objectives of the present study were to provide quantitative data on the impact of air pollution on the health of people living in two small municipalities in a highly industrialized, densely populated area of Northern Italy. We applied the approach proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) using the AirQ 2.2.3 software developed by the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health, Bilthoven Division. Daily concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter ≤10$\mu$m (PM10) and ≤2.5$\mu$m (PM2.5) were used to assess human exposure and health effects in terms of attributable proportion of the health outcome, annual number of excess cases of mortality for all causes, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Long-term effects were estimated for PM2.5 as years of life lost. Considering short-term effects, PM2.5 had the highest health impact on the 24,000 inhabitants of the two small towns, causing an excess of total mortality of 8 out of 177 in a year. Ozone and nitrogen dioxide each caused about three excess cases of total mortality. Results on long-term effects showed, respectively, 433, 180, and 72 years of life lost for mortality for all causes, cardiopulmonary diseases and lung cancer, in a year. These results are consistent with other reports of the impact of air quality on human health and the AirQ software seems an effective and easy tool, helpful in decision-making.},

abstract = {Background
El Paso County (Texas) is prone to still air inversions and is one of the dust “hot spots” in North America. In this context, we examined the sub-lethal effects of airborne dust and low wind events on human respiratory health (i.e., asthma and acute bronchitis) between 2000 and 2003, when 110 dust and 157 low wind events occurred. Because environmental conditions may not affect everyone the same, we explored the effects of dust and low wind within three age groups (children, adults, and the elderly), testing for effect modifications by sex and insurance status, while controlling for weather and air pollutants.
Methods
We used a case-crossover design using events matched with referent days on the same day-of-the-week, month, and year with conditional logistic regression to estimate the probability of hospital admission, while controlling for apparent temperature (lag 1), nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter of 2.5$\mu$m or less.
Results
Children (aged 1–17) were 1.19 (95% confidence interval: 1.00–1.41) times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma three days after a low wind event, and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.01–1.75) times more likely to be hospitalized for acute bronchitis one day after a dust event than on a clear day. Girls were more sensitive to acute bronchitis hospitalizations after dust events (1.83, 95% CI: 1.09–3.08) than boys, but less sensitive than boys to acute bronchitis hospitalizations after low wind events (0.68, 95% CI: 0.46−1.00). We found general trends with regard to dust and low wind events being associated with increased odds of hospitalization for asthma and bronchitis amongst all ages and adults (aged 18–64). Adults covered by Medicaid and adults without health insurance had higher risks of hospitalization for asthma and acute bronchitis after both low wind and dust events.
Conclusions
Results suggest that there were respiratory health effects associated with dust and low wind events in El Paso, with stronger impacts among children and poor adults. Girls and boys with acute bronchitis were differentially sensitive to dust and low wind events.},

Since children spend on average 7–11 h per weekday at school, the IAQ in classrooms is expected to play a key role in the assessment of the effects of their personal exposure to air pollution. Within this context the present study was conducted in order to fulfill three primary objectives 1) to measure the levels and the element composition of PM2.5 and PM2.5–10, in three primary schools placed in Lisbon, in order to assess the children exposure to these pollutants; 2) to study the relationship between indoor and outdoor atmospheric particles concentrations and 3) to investigate the sources of high aerosols concentrations in classrooms. In the studied classrooms, the concentrations of coarse particles significantly exceeded the ambient levels. Element concentrations suggested that the physical activity of students highly contributed to the re-suspension of sedimented particles. The high levels of CO2 indicated that in these schools the ventilation was inadequate. This fact contributed to the establishment of poor IAQ.},

We investigated the effects of urban particulate pollutants including ultrafine particles on atopic severity in children with atopic dermatitis. We included 41 schoolchildren, 8–12 years old, who had been diagnosed with atopic dermatitis. For 67 consecutive days, all of them measured their symptoms in a diary. To assess exposure, the daily ambient mass concentrations of particulate matter less than 10, 2.5 and 1$\mu$m (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1, respectively) and concentrations of submicron particles (0.01–1$\mu$m) were measured at a local school. The mean mass concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 were 74.0, 57.8 and 50.8$\mu$g/m3, respectively. The mean concentrations were 41,335/cm3 ultrafine particles (UFPs) and 8577/cm3 accumulation mode (0.1–1$\mu$m) particles. Significant associations were found between the concentrations of ultrafine particles and the itchiness symptom in children with atopic dermatitis. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in previous day ultrafine particles concentration (IQR: 28–140/m3) was significantly associated with a 3.1% (95% confidence interval, 0.2–6.1) increase in the itch symptom score for children with atopic dermatitis. The results suggested that the concentration of ambient ultrafine particles may exacerbate skin symptoms in children with atopic dermatitis.},

In most real life cases, relevant policy making is characterised by the lack of information related to the economic value of the health consequences attributed to air pollution. This information is important to possess reliable economic estimates for the benefit arising from the application of the proposed strategies. This paper presents a contingent valuation approach in order to elicit the willingness–to–pay (WTP) for reducing the risk of premature mortality attributed to air pollution based on an easy–to–comprehend questionnaire. The economic value of increasing life expectancy by saving one year of life loss through improving air quality is estimated for Thessaloniki, Greece, which is considered one of the most polluted –if not the most polluted– cities within Europe, especially with respect to airborne particles. A sample of approximately 800 residents was chosen and a face–to–face interview was conducted using a hypothetical open–ended question designed to elicit the respondents WTP. Change in life expectancy was well understood and the results showed that 78.2% of respondents were able to express their WTP. The mean WTP to save one Year of Life Loss (YOLL) is approximately 920 € per person per year, which corresponds to a Value of a Life Year (VOLY) that is approximately 41 000 €.},

abstract = {Particulate pollution is an environmental concern that is widespread and difficult to resolve. Recently various regulatory improvements around the world have been agreed upon to tackle this problem, especially as related to the fine fraction of particulates, which more closely correlates to human health effects than other fractions. The size-fractionation of inhalable particles and their organic composition represent a new area of research that has been poorly explored thus far. Endotoxins are a type of natural organic compound that can be found in particulate matter. They are correlated with Gram-negative bacterial contamination. Health outcomes associated with exposure to these toxins are not specific and often overlap with the health effects of PM (Particulate Matter) exposure, including asthma, bronchitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and organic dust toxic syndrome. Very little information is available on the endotoxin distribution in different PM10 size fractions. This study examined PM10 size fractions and their endotoxin content. Sampling was conducted at five different locations: one urban, two rural and two rural sites that were highly influenced by large-scale farm animal production facilities. For each location, six different PM10 fractions were evaluated. PM10 sub-fractions were categorised as follows: PM10–7.2 (1.15–31.30 $\mu$g m−3); PM7.2–3.0 (1.86–30.73 $\mu$g m−3); PM3.0–1.5 (1.74–13.90 $\mu$g m−3); PM1.5–0.95 (0.24–10.57 $\mu$g m−3); PM0.95–0.49 (1.22–14.33 $\mu$g m−3) and PM<0.49 (13.15–85.49 $\mu$g m−3). The ranges of endotoxin levels determined were: PM10–7.2 (0.051–5.401 endotoxin units (EU) m−3); PM7.2–3.0 (0.123–7.801 EU m−3); PM3.0–1.5 (0.057–1.635 EU m−3); PM1.5–0.95 (0.040–2.477 EU m−3); PM0.95–0.49 (0.007–3.159 EU m−3) and PM<0.49 (0.039–3.975 EU m−3). Our results indicated consistency of the PM1 fraction at all of the sites and the predominant presence of endotoxins in the coarse fraction. The observed abatement of the PM10 and endotoxin levels was very high (above 1:10) as little as 50 m from the pollution source. This kind of model is useful to both improve our knowledge about PM10 endotoxin distribution and to evaluate the potential risks for the health of neighbouring populations.},

abstract = {Background
Maternal exposure to air pollution has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Few studies took into account the spatial and temporal variation of air pollution levels.
Objectives
To evaluate the impact of maternal exposure to traffic-related air pollution during pregnancy on preterm birth and term birth weight using a spatio-temporal exposure model.
Methods
We estimated maternal residential exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5) and soot during pregnancy (entire pregnancy, 1st trimester, and last month) for 3853 singleton births within the Dutch PIAMA prospective birth cohort study by means of temporally adjusted land-use regression models. Associations between air pollution concentrations and preterm birth and term birth weight were analyzed by means of logistic and linear regression models with and without adjustment for maternal physical, lifestyle, and socio-demographic characteristics.
Results
We found positive, statistically non-significant associations between exposure to soot during entire pregnancy and during the last month of pregnancy and preterm birth [adj. OR (95% CI) per interquartile range increase in exposure 1.08 (0.88–1.34) and 1.09 (0.93–1.27), respectively]. There was no indication of an adverse effect of air pollution exposure on term birth weight.
Conclusions
In this study, maternal exposure to traffic-related air pollution during pregnancy was not associated with term birth weight. There was a tendency towards an increased risk of preterm birth with increasing air pollution exposure, but statistical power was low.},

abstract = {Using the data on all live births (∼400,000) and criteria pollutants from the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) between 2000 and 2004, this paper empirically demonstrates how mismatches in the spatiotemporal scales of health and air pollution data can result in inconsistency and uncertainty in the linkages between air pollution and birth outcomes. This paper suggests that the risks of low birth weight associated with air pollution exposure changes significantly as the distance interval (around the monitoring stations) used for exposure estimation changes. For example, when the analysis was restricted within 3 miles distance of the monitoring stations the odds of LBW (births <2500 g) increased by a factor of 1.045 (±0.0285 95% CI) with a unit increase in the average daily exposure to PM10 (in $\mu$g m−3) during the gestation period; the value dropped to 1.028 when the analysis was restricted within 6 miles distance of air pollution monitoring stations. The effect of PM10 exposure on LBW became null when controlled for confounders. But PM2.5 exposure showed a significant association with low birth weight when controlled for confounders. These results must be interpreted with caution, because the distance to monitoring station does not influence the risks of adverse birth outcomes, but uncertainty in exposure increases with the increase in distance from the monitoring stations, especially for coarse particles such as PM10 that settle with gravity within short distance and time interval. The results of this paper have important implications for the research design of environmental epidemiological studies, and the way air pollution (and potentially other environmental) and health data are collocated to compute exposure. While this paper challenges the findings of pervious epidemiological studies that have relied on coarse resolution air pollution data (such as county level aggregated data), the paper also calls for time-space resolved estimate of air pollution to minimize uncertainty in exposure estimation.},

As part of the China Air Pollution and Health Effects Study (CAPES), this study aimed at investigating the short-term association between SO2 and daily mortality in 17 Chinese cities. We applied two-stage Bayesian hierarchical models to obtain city-specific and national average estimates for SO2. In each city, we used Poisson regression models incorporating natural spline smoothing functions to adjust for long-term and seasonal trend of mortality, as well as other time-varying covariates. We examined the associations by age, gender and education status. As a result, the combined analysis showed that an increase of 10$\mu$g/m3 of two-day moving averaged SO2 was associated with 0.75% [95% posterior interval (PI), 0.47 to 1.02], 0.83% (0.95% PI, 0.47 to 1.19) and 1.25% (95% PI, 0.78 to 1.73) increase of total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, respectively. The effects of SO2 appeared more evident among the elderly. These associations were generally independent of particles with aerodynamic diameter <10$\mu$m (PM10) but did not persist after adjustment for nitrogen dioxide (NO2). In conclusions, this largest epidemiologic study of air pollution in China to date suggests that short-term exposure to SO2 is associated with increased mortality risk; however, these associations may be attributable to SO2 serving as a surrogate of other substances. Further studies are needed to tackle the independent health effect of SO2.},

Asian dust includes soil-derived metals, anthropogenic metals, and many other air pollutants at various concentrations, depending on the atmospheric transport route. Here, we investigated the possible causes for the diversity in symptoms produced by Asian dust events, as reported in a questionnaire survey, on the basis of the dust components and estimated trajectories. Nine dust events were recorded and classified into three types on the basis of light detection and ranging (lidar) data: Type 1 events with high counts of non-mineral dust (spherical) particles, Type 2 events with high counts of mineral dust particles in comparison to non-mineral dust particles, and Type 3 events with very low counts of non-mineral dust particles as compared with other Asian dust events during the surveillance period. Ensemble backward trajectory analysis showed that the atmospheric transport route indeed accounted for the differences. Subjective symptom scores showed the greatest increase after exposure to Type 1 events and a decrease after exposure to Type 3 events. A variety of aerosols were detected concurrent with Asian dust events, and the link between health effects in humans and changes in pollutant levels was explored. The results suggest that the components of Asian dust should be considered when investigating related health effects.},

The Aggregate Risk Index is based on the Cairncross's concept, obtained from the Relative Risk associated with short-term exposure to common air pollutants and takes into account the possible effects of a mixture of pollutants. This communication tool, easy to use and intuitive, about the levels of air pollution and the associated health risks, will be used to communicate information to the general population, authorities and to the health care community and will provide advanced warning of potentially health-damaging air pollution events.},

abstract = {To address disparities in health risks associated with ambient air pollution for racial/ethnic minority groups, this study characterized personal and ambient concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a suspected hot spot of air pollution – the Village of Waterfront South (WFS), and an urban reference community – the Copewood/Davis Streets (CDS) neighborhood in Camden, New Jersey. Both are minority-dominant, impoverished communities. We collected 24-h integrated personal air samples from 54 WFS residents and 53 CDS residents, with one sample on a weekday and one on a weekend day during the summer and winter seasons of 2004–2006. Ambient air samples from the center of each community were also collected simultaneously during personal air sampling. Toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (TEX) presented higher (p < 0.05) ambient levels in WFS than in CDS, particularly during weekdays. A stronger association between personal and ambient concentrations of MTBE and TEX was found in WFS than in CDS. Fourteen to forty-two percent of the variation in personal MTBE, hexane, benzene, and TEX was explained by local outdoor air pollution. These observations indicated that local sources impacted the community air pollution and personal exposure in WFS. The estimated cancer risks resulting from two locally emitted VOCs, benzene and ethylbenzene, and non-cancer neurological and respiratory effects resulting from hexane, benzene, toluene, and xylenes exceeded the US EPA risk benchmarks in both communities. These findings emphasized the need to address disparity in health risks associated with ambient air pollution for the socio-economically disadvantaged groups. This study also demonstrated that air pollution hot spots similar to WFS can provide robust setting to investigate health effects of ambient air pollution.},

In view of Lanzhou's special geographical location, taking into account the impact of different seasons, especially for the winter, the relations between air pollutants and the respiratory disease deserve further study. In this study the monthly average concentration of SO2, NO2, PM10 and the monthly number of people who in hospital because of lower respiratory disease from January 2001 to December 2005 are grouped equidistant and considered as the terms of transactions. Then based on the relational algebraic theory we employed the optimization relation association rule to mine the association rules of the transactions. Based on the association rules revealing the effects of air pollutants on the lower respiratory disease, we forecast the number of person who suffered from lower respiratory disease by the group method of data handling (GMDH) to reveal the risk and give a consultation to the hospital in Xigu District, the most seriously polluted district in Lanzhou. The data and analysis indicate that individuals may be susceptible to the short-term effects of pollution and thus suffer from lower respiratory diseases and this effect presents seasonal.},

abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most toxic air pollutants in China. Efforts in assessing population inhalation exposure to PAHs, and its contribution to lung cancer risk for Chinese residents, have been limited due to insufficient data on measured indoor concentrations. A mass-balance model to predict indoor PAH concentrations was developed, along with estimated exposures and attributable lung cancer risks for residents in the Beijing region in 2006, with a 2-stage Monte Carlo simulation framework. The exposures and risks were split into three parts, based on the sources and places of exposure, to estimate the contributions of indoor and outdoor PAH sources and exposures, in order to better understand the source and place pattern of PAH exposure. PAHs bring considerable lung cancer risk to the population of Beijing region. The population attributable fraction (PAF) of lung cancer for Beijing's overall population is 2.99% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71%–4.26%]. Median contribution of indoor exposure to outdoor-originated PAHs (OUT–in) is 78% (CI: 73%–81%) in the overall population, for 97% (CI: 94%–99%) of whom OUT–in is the largest contributor. Rural residents are facing considerable exposure to indoor-originated PAHs (IN–in), which dominates the total exposure in 12% (CI: 2%–24%) of the rural population. This model framework could be used in quantitative comparison of different interventions on exposure to PAHs as well as other airborne pollutants.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated that elevated concentrations of suspended atmospheric particulate matter (PM) are associated with adverse health effects. In order to minimize the adverse public health effects of atmospheric PM by exposure management, there is a need for a greater understanding of the toxic mechanisms and the components that are responsible for the toxic effects. The aim of this study was to utilize bioassay techniques to investigate these aspects. For this purpose a reporter panel of 9 genetically engineered bacterial (Escherichia coli) strains was composed. Each panel member was designed to report on a different stress condition with a measurable light signal produced by the luciferase enzyme. Toxic mechanisms and components were studied using six anthropogenic PM source samples, including two vehicle combustion particles, three coal fly ash (CFA) samples and an urban dust sample. The most prominent outcome of the panel exposure results were broad panel responses observed for two of the CFA samples, indicating oxidative stress, respiration inhibition and iron deficiency. These responses were relieved when the samples were treated with EDTA, a non-specific metal chelator, suggesting the involvement of metals in the observed effects. Bioavailability analysis of the samples suggests that chromium was related to the toxic responses induced by two of the CFA samples. Oxidative stress was also observed in several samples of ambient atmospheric aerosols and excess metal toxicity in an urban dust sample collected in a parking lot. The reporter panel approach, as demonstrated in this study, has the potential of providing novel insights as to the mechanisms of atmospheric PM toxicity. Furthermore, combining the panel's results with bioavailability data can enlighten about the role of different PM components in the observed toxicity.},

In this study, the main emission sources of 11 particle-phase PAHs listed as carcinogenic and mutagenic agents by the IARC were identified by a risk apportionment method. The contribution of sources to the total concentration of PAHs in the study area was also quantified. A receptor model based on factor and multiple linear regression analyses was applied to estimate the source-specific risk associated to PAH inhalation in an urban background area of a large city (Venice-Mestre, Northern Italy). The proposed approach has discriminated the sources of mutagenic and carcinogenic congeners and their role in determining a serious hazard for human health. Results, interpreted on the basis of seasonal variations and atmospheric conditions, have shown that even though domestic heating is the main source of total PAHs in winter, a background pollution including traffic mainly accounts for the carcinogenic and mutagenic risk during the whole year. The findings of this work and the approach used can be easily applied to other geographic areas and provide useful information for local and regional air pollution control strategies.},

abstract = {We aimed to investigate the effects of ambient air pollutants on daily mortality in a relatively stable and homogeneous population in Guangzhou, China. Daily mortality, air pollution, and weather data between 2006 and 2009 were collected. The generalized additive model with poison regression was used to estimate the excessive risks (ERs) of air pollutants (PM10, SO2, and NO2) on total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. The effects of lag0–1 were the greatest for total non-accidental and cardiovascular deaths. The increments of 10$\mu$gm−3 in SO2, NO2, and PM10 were associated with ERs of 1.54% (95%CI: 1.03–2.06%), 1.42% (95%CI: 1.06–1.78%), and 1.26% (95%CI: 0.86–1.66%) respectively for total non-accidental deaths, and 2.28% (95%CI: 1.40–3.16%), 1.81% (95%CI: 1.20–2.41%), and 1.79% (95%CI: 1.11–2.47%) respectively for cardiovascular deaths. For persons who died from respiratory disease, however, the maximum effects occurred at lag0. The ERs for SO2, NO2, and PM10 were 1.36% (95%CI: 0.23–2.50%), 1.47% (95%CI: 0.66–2.29%) and 0.93% (95%CI: 0.03–1.83%), respectively. The effects of the three air pollutants on mortality were stronger in elderly and in women. The ERs in the present study were higher than those reported in Europe, the U.S., and most other Asian cities. Our findings show relatively higher ERs of daily mortality by ambient air pollutants in the center of Guangzhou, China, compared with estimates in other cities. Further studies with accurate exposure measurement among homogeneous population are needed to evaluate the precise magnitudes of the effects of the air pollutants.},

@article{Cassee2012,
abstract = {Background
Cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles improve the burning efficiency of fuel, however, little is known about health impacts of altered emissions from the vehicles.
Methods
Atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE−/−) mice were exposed by inhalation to diluted exhaust (1.7mg/m3, 20, 60 or 180min, 5 day/week, for 4 weeks), from an engine using standard diesel fuel (DE) or the same diesel fuel containing 9ppm cerium oxide nanoparticles (DCeE). Changes in hematological indices, clinical chemistry, atherosclerotic burden, tissue levels of inflammatory cytokines and pathology of the major organs were assessed.
Results
Addition of CeO2 to fuel resulted in a reduction of the number (30%) and surface area (10%) of the particles in the exhaust, whereas the gaseous co-pollutants were increased (6–8%). There was, however, a trend towards an increased size and complexity of the atherosclerotic plaques following DE exposure, which was not evident in the DCeE group. There were no clear signs of altered hematological or pathological changes induced by either treatment. However, levels of proinflammatory cytokines were modulated in a brain region and liver following DCeE exposure.
Conclusions
These results imply that addition of CeO2 nanoparticles to fuel decreases the number of particles in exhaust and may reduce atherosclerotic burden associated with exposure to standard diesel fuel. From the extensive assessment of biological parameters performed, the only concerning effect of cerium addition was a slightly raised level of cytokines in a region of the central nervous system. Overall, the use of cerium as a fuel additive may be a potentially useful way to limit the health effects of vehicle exhaust. However, further testing is required to ensure that such an approach is not associated with a chronic inflammatory response which may eventually cause long-term health effects.},

Our objective was to investigate the correlation between air pollution and acute manifestations of blepharitis. Method: We recorded all cases of changes in the eyelids and ocular surface, and rated clinical findings on a scale from zero (normal) to two (severe alterations). Daily values of carbon monoxide, particulate matter smaller than 10$\mu$m in diameter and nitrogen dioxide concentrations and meteorological variables (temperature and relative humidity) in the vicinity of the medical service were obtained. Specific linear regression models for each outcome were constructed including pollutants as independent variables (single pollutant models). Temperature and humidity were included as confounding variables. Results: increases of 28.8$\mu$g/m3 in the concentration of particulate matter and 1.1ppm in the concentration of CO were associated with increases in cases of blepharitis on the day of exposure (5 cases, 95% CI: 1–10 and 6 cases, 95% CI: 1–12, respectively). Conclusion: Exposure to usual air pollutants concentrations present in large cities affects, in a consistent manner, the eyes of residents contributing to the increasing incidence of diseases of the eyelid margin.},

abstract = {Background: The insecticide chlordecone was extensively used in the French West Indies to control banana root borer. Its persistence in soils has led to the widespread pollution of the environment, and human beings are still exposed to this chemical. Chlordecone has been shown to impair neurological and behavioural functions in rodents when exposed gestationally or neonatally. Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of prenatal and postnatal exposure to chlordecone on the cognitive, visual, and motor development of 7-month-old infants from Guadeloupe. Methods: Infants were tested at 7 months (n=153). Visual recognition memory and processing speed were assessed with the Fagan Tests of Infant Intelligence (FTII), visual acuity with the Teller Acuity Card, and fine motor development with the Brunet-Lezine. Samples of cord blood and breast milk at 3 months (n=88) were analyzed for chlordecone concentrations. Postnatal exposure was determined through breast feeding and frequency of contaminated food consumption by the infants. Results: Cord chlordecone concentrations in tertiles were associated with reduced novelty preference on the FTII in the highly exposed group ($\beta$=−0.19, p=0.02). Postnatal exposure through contaminated food consumption was marginally related to reduced novelty preference ($\beta$=−0.14, p=0.07), and longer processing speed ($\beta$=0.16, p=0.07). Detectable levels of chlordecone in cord blood were associated with higher risk of obtaining low scores on the fine motor development scale (OR=1.25, p<0.01). Conclusion: These results suggest that pre- and postnatal low chronic exposure to chlordecone is associated with negative effects on cognitive and motor development during infancy.},

Most studies of particles examined total mass, although the chemical structure of particles varies widely. We investigated whether mother's exposure to potassium (K) and titanium (Ti) components of airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during pregnancy was associated with birth weight or risk of low birth weight (<2500g) for term infants. The study population was 76,788 infants born in four counties in Connecticut and Massachusetts, US, for August 2000–February 2004. Both K and Ti were associated with birth weight. An interquartile range (IQR) increase K was associated with an 8.75% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24–16.8%) increase in risk of low birth weight. An IQR increase in Ti was associated with a 12.1% (95% CI: 3.55–21.4%) increase in risk of low birth weight, with an estimate of 6.41% (95% CI: −5.80–20.2%) for males and 16.4% (95% CI: 5.13–28.9%) for females. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis of first births only, but not adjustment by co-pollutants. Disentangling the effects of various chemical components is challenging because of the covariance among some components due to similar sources. Central effect estimates for infants of African–American mothers were higher than those of white mothers, although the confidence intervals overlapped. Our results indicate that exposure to airborne potassium and titanium during pregnancy is associated with lower birth weight. Associations may relate to chemical components of sources producing K and Ti.},

abstract = {In this study, a systematic overview of inhalable particulate matter (PM10) pollution in China was conducted based on the dataset from national monitoring network from 2001 to 2011. The long-term trend, spatial and temporal distributions, and health impacts of PM10 pollution were evaluated. It was found that the annual PM10 concentration decreased from 116.0 $\mu$g m−3 in 2001 to 85.3 $\mu$g m−3 in 2011. The days with PM10 concentration above the new Chinese ambient air quality standard dropped from 66 (18%) in 2001 to 28 (7.8%) in 2011, while the days exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline decreased from 294 (80.5%) in 2001 to 250 (68.5%) in 2011. PM10 pollution in northern China is much worse than that in southern China. Six of nine most polluted cities (>110 $\mu$g m−3) are in the north, while six cleanest cities (<50 $\mu$g m−3) are all in the south. The seasonal average PM10 concentrations in 2001–2011 for all cities are 104.4 $\mu$g m−3 (spring), 75.3 $\mu$g m−3 (summer), 94.7 $\mu$g m−3 (autumn), and 118.4 $\mu$g m−3 (winter), respectively, indicating that winter and spring are the most polluted seasons. Different health endpoints due to PM10 pollution show similar trends. Taking premature mortality between 2001 and 2011 as an example, the ratio of deaths due to PM10 pollution to all causes of deaths dropped from 13.5% to 11.6% and 511,000 deaths are avoided due to the concentration reduction, though the absolute damage number due to PM10 pollution increased from 418,000 to 514,000 because of increasing urban population. These results indicate that PM10 pollution in China has been eased significantly over the last decade, mainly due to the application of emission control measures. However, the PM10 concentration remains at a high level comparing with the WHO guideline and its health impacts are still significant.},

abstract = {The daily variations of air pollutants in the Klang Valley, Malaysia, which includes Kuala Lumpur were investigated for its association with mortality counts using time series analysis. This study located in the tropic with much less seasonal variation than typically seen in more temperate climates. Data on daily mortality for the Klang Valley (2000–2006), daily mean concentrations of air pollutants of PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, O3, daily maximum O3 and meteorological conditions were obtained from Malaysian Department of Environment. We examined the association between pollutants and daily mortality using Poisson regression while controlling for time trends and meteorological factors. Effects of the pollutants (Relative Risk, RR) on current-day (lag 0) mortality to seven previous days (lag 7) and the effects of the pollutants from the first two days (lag 01) to the first eight days (lag 07) were determined. We found significant associations in the single-pollutant model for PM10 and the daily mean O3 with natural mortality. For the daily mean O3, the highest association was at lag 05 (RR = 1.0215, 95% CI = 1.0013–1.0202). CO was found not significantly associated with natural mortality, however the RR's of CO were found to be consistently higher than PM10. In spite of significant results of PM10, the magnitude of RR's of PM10 was not important for natural mortality in comparison with either daily mean O3 or CO. There is an association between daily mean O3 and natural mortality in a two-pollutants model after adjusting for PM10. Most pollutants except SO2, were significantly associated with respiratory mortality in a single pollutant model. Daily mean O3 is also important for respiratory mortality, with over 10% of mortality associated with every IQR increased. These findings are noteworthy because seasonal confounding is unlikely in this relatively stable climate, by contrast with more temperate regions.},

abstract = {Associations between ambient pollution and respiratory morbidity including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been confirmed. Weather factors, such as temperature, season and relative humidity (RH), may modify the effects of air pollution. This time series study was conducted to examine whether the effects of air pollution on emergency COPD hospital admissions in Hong Kong varied across seasons and RH levels, and explore the possible joint modification of season and RH on the effects of pollution. Data of daily air pollution concentrations mean temperature and RH, and COPD hospital admissions from 1998 to 2007 were collected. Generalized additive Poisson models with interaction terms were used to estimate the effects of pollution across seasons and RH levels. We observed an increase in the detrimental effects of air pollution in the cool season and on low humidity days. On the cool and dry days, a 10 $\mu$g m−3 increment of lag03 exposure was associated with an increase in emergency COPD admissions by 1.76% (95%CI: 1.19–2.34%), 3.43% (95%CI: 2.80–4.07%), and 1.99% (95%CI: 0.90–3.09%) for nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), respectively, all of which were statistically significantly higher than those on the other days. No consistent modification of weather factors was found for the effects of particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 $\mu$m (PM10). The results suggested that season and RH jointly modified the effects of gaseous pollutants, resulting in increased emergency COPD hospitalizations on the cool and dry days.},

abstract = {We developed a risk-based, multi-pollutant air quality health index (AQHI) reporting system in Hong Kong, based on the Canadian approach. We performed time series studies to obtain the relative risks of hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases associated with four air pollutants: sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 $\mu$m (PM10). We then calculated the sum of excess risks of the hospital admissions associated with these air pollutants. The cut-off points of the summed excess risk, for the issuance of different health warnings, were based on the concentrations of these pollutants recommended as short-term Air Quality Guidelines by the World Health Organization. The excess risks were adjusted downwards for young children and the elderly. Health risk was grouped into five categories and sub-divided into eleven bands, with equal increments in excess risk from band 1 up to band 10 (the 11th band is ‘band 10+'). We developed health warning messages for the general public, including at-risk groups: young children, the elderly, and people with pre-existing cardiac or respiratory diseases. The new system addressed two major shortcomings of the current standard-based system; namely, the time lag between a sudden rise in air pollutant concentrations and the issue of a health warning, and the reliance on one dominant pollutant to calculate the index. Hence, the AQHI represents an improvement over Hong Kong's existing air pollution index.},

The associations between gaseous air pollutants and AMI mortality were estimated using time-stratified case-crossover analyses. NO2 and SO2 were found to be significantly associated with increased AMI mortality. The odds ratios (ORs) were 1.0455 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.017–1.0748) and 1.0256 (95% CI: 1.0027–1.0489) for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in the current day's NO2 and SO2 concentration, respectively, and this association persisted in 2-pollutant models; and no association was observed for CO and O3. It is likely that exposure to elevated ambient NO2 and SO2 air pollution contributed to increased AMI mortality.},

abstract = {This study reports the measurement of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in airborne particles ≤10$\mu$m (PM10) during four years. Seasonal variation was observed for PM10 and PAH in southwest Mexico City, with major mass concentrations during the dry season (November–April). A non linear decreasing trend of PM10 was observed during this period, while a linear increase (in the four years) was obtained for benzo[a]pyrene (88pgm−3), phenanthrene (29pgm−3), fluoranthene (88pgm−3), and benzo[ghi]perylene (438pgm−3). Coronene also showed an increasing trend but it was nonlinear. This suggests that air control strategies implemented by the government contributed to maintaining PM10 under the 24h maximum limit and resulted in a decreasing trend during this period. However, these strategies did not result in controlling some organic constituents with mutagenic and/or carcinogenic properties as it is the case of benzo[a]pyrene. The annual average of this PAH exceeded the UK recommendation. It was estimated a median (10th–90th) lifetime health risk of 7.6 (3.4–17.2) additional cases of cancer per 10million people in this zone exists and the health risk of PAH is almost three times greater in dry seasons than it is in rainy seasons. Specific humidity, temperature and wind speed acted as cleaners for PM10 and PAH from the atmosphere. PAH diagnostic ratios and correlation and principal component analyses suggest incomplete combustion from gasoline and diesel engines as the main contributor to PAH found in southwest Mexico City, where factor 1 grouped all PAH emitted from gasoline engines during first three years. During last year, factor 1 only grouped PAH markers of diesel engines. This suggests a change of emission amounts between gasoline and diesel combustion sources or a contribution of other source(s) which changed the PAH profiles. During four years retene was always separated from factors which grouped the rest of PAH, due to its wood combustion origin.},

In order to examine whether the exposure to ambient air pollution was associated with the prevalence of stroke and CVDs among people living in a heavy industrial province of northeast China, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 24,845 Chinese adults, ages 18–74 years old, from 33 communities in the 11 districts of the three Northeastern Chinese Cities during 2009. Three-year (2006–2008) average concentrations of particles with an aerodynamic diameter ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxides (NO2), and Ozone (O3) were calculated from monitoring stations in each of the 11 districts. We used two-level logistic regressions models to examine the effects of yearly variations in exposure to each pollutant, controlling for important covariates. We found significant associations between PM10 and SO2 levels and stroke prevalence after accounting for important covariates: the adjusted odds ratio for stroke increased by 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03–1.30) per 19 $\mu$g m−3 increase in PM10, and 1.14 (95%CI, 1.01–1.29) per 20 $\mu$g m−3 increase in SO2, respectively. When stratified analysis by gender, these associations were significant only in men, but not in women.

In this analysis, we examined the associations between daily air pollution levels [particulate matter less than 10 microns in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)] and COPD mortality in four Chinese cities. We used Poisson regression models with natural spline smoothing functions to adjust for long-term and seasonal trends of COPD mortality, as well as other time-varying covariates. We did a meta-analysis to obtain the 4-city average estimates. Air pollution (PM10, SO2, and NO2) was found to be associated with increased risk of COPD mortality in these four cities. Using the random-effects model, an increase of 10 $\mu$g m−3 of 2-day moving average concentrations of PM10, SO2 and NO2 corresponded to a 0.78% (95% CI, 0.13–1.42), 1.30% (95% CI, 0.61–1.99), and 1.78% (95% CI, 1.10–2.46) increase of COPD mortality, respectively. The concentration–response curves indicated linear associations without threshold. Only NO2 remained significant in the multi-pollutant models. To our knowledge, this is the first multi-city study in Asian developing region to report the short-term effect of air pollution on COPD mortality. Our results contribute to very limited data on the effects of air pollution on COPD mortality for high exposure settings typical in developing countries.},

abstract = {Background
Synoptic circulation patterns (large-scale weather systems) affect ambient levels of air pollution, as well as the relationship between air pollution and human health.
Objective
To investigate the air pollution–mortality relationship within weather types and seasons, and to determine which combination of atmospheric conditions may pose increased health threats in the elderly age categories.
Methods
The relative risk of mortality (RR) due to air pollution was examined using Poisson generalized linear models (GLMs) within specific weather types. Analysis was completed by weather type and age group (all ages, ≤64, 65–74, 75–84, ≥85 years) in ten Canadian cities from 1981 to 1999.
Results
There was significant modification of RR by weather type and age. When examining the entire population, weather type was shown to have the greatest modifying effect on the risk of dying due to ozone (O3). This effect was highest on average for the dry tropical (DT) weather type, with the all-age RR of mortality at a population weighted mean (PWM) found to be 1.055 (95% CI 1.026–1.085). All-weather type risk estimates increased with age due to exposure to carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2). On average, RR increased by 2.6, 3.8 and 1.5% for the respective pollutants between the ≤64 and ≥85 age categories. Conversely, mean ozone estimates remained relatively consistent with age. Elevated levels of air pollution were found to be detrimental to the health of elderly individuals for all weather types. However, the entire population was negatively effected by air pollution on the hot dry (DT) and hot humid (MT) days.
Conclusions
We identified a significant modification of RR for mortality due to air pollution by age, which is enhanced under specific weather types. Efforts should be targeted at minimizing pollutant exposure to the elderly and/or all age groups with respect to weather type in question.},

During our research period, the mean daily concentrations of black carbon and PM2.5 were 3.9$\mu$g/m3 and 53.9$\mu$g/m3, respectively. The regression results showed that black carbon was significantly associated with total and cardiovascular mortality, but not with respiratory mortality. An inter-quartile range increase (2.7$\mu$g/m3) of black carbon corresponded to a 2.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6–4.1), 3.2% (95% CI: 0.6–5.7), and 0.6% (95% CI: −4.5 to 5.7) increase in total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, respectively. When adjusted for PM2.5, the effects of black carbon increased and remained statistically significant; in contrast, the associations of PM2.5 with daily mortality decreased and became statistically insignificant after adjustment for black carbon. To our knowledge, this is the first study in China, or even in Asian developing countries, to report the acute effect of black carbon and PM2.5 on daily mortality simultaneously. Our findings suggest that black carbon is a valuable additional air quality indicator to evaluate the health risks of ambient particles.},

Different levels, seasonal patterns, and health–risks of air pollutants (PM10, NO2, and SO2) in haze and non–haze periods were observed. The results showed that the average PM10, NO2, and SO2 concentrations were 110.9 $\mu$g/m3, 67.7 $\mu$g/m3, and 48.8 $\mu$g/m3 in haze periods and 63.6 $\mu$g/m3, 45.3 $\mu$g/m3, and 27.5 $\mu$g/m3 in non–haze periods, respectively. Due to a combination of increased emissions from heating sources coupled with meteorological conditions, PM10, NO2, and SO2 levels were highest in winter and lowest in autumn. For the potential health risk analysis, the residents have been divided into four age categories namely, infants, children (1 year), children (8–10 years) and adults. The analysis took into account age–specific breathing rates, body weights for different age categories. Health risks for all age groups in haze periods were higher than those in non–haze periods, and the local residents suffered from the highest health risks due to NO2 in haze periods.},

abstract = {Combustion emissions adversely impact air quality and human health. A multiscale air quality model is applied to assess the health impacts of major emissions sectors in United States. Emissions are classified according to six different sources: electric power generation, industry, commercial and residential sources, road transportation, marine transportation and rail transportation. Epidemiological evidence is used to relate long-term population exposure to sector-induced changes in the concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone to incidences of premature death. Total combustion emissions in the U.S. account for about 200,000 (90% CI: 90,000–362,000) premature deaths per year in the U.S. due to changes in PM2.5 concentrations, and about 10,000 (90% CI: −1000 to 21,000) deaths due to changes in ozone concentrations. The largest contributors for both pollutant-related mortalities are road transportation, causing ∼53,000 (90% CI: 24,000–95,000) PM2.5-related deaths and ∼5000 (90% CI: −900 to 11,000) ozone-related early deaths per year, and power generation, causing ∼52,000 (90% CI: 23,000–94,000) PM2.5-related and ∼2000 (90% CI: −300 to 4000) ozone-related premature mortalities per year. Industrial emissions contribute to ∼41,000 (90% CI: 18,000–74,000) early deaths from PM2.5 and ∼2000 (90% CI: 0–4000) early deaths from ozone. The results are indicative of the extent to which policy measures could be undertaken in order to mitigate the impact of specific emissions from different sectors — in particular black carbon emissions from road transportation and sulfur dioxide emissions from power generation.},

abstract = {Exposures to ambient diesel exhaust particles have been associated with respiratory symptoms and asthma exacerbations in children; however, epidemiologic evidence linking short-term exposure to ambient diesel exhaust particles with airway inflammation is limited. We conducted a panel study with asthmatic and nonasthmatic adolescents to characterize associations between ambient diesel exhaust particle exposures and exhaled biological markers of airway inflammation and oxidative stress. Over four weeks, exhaled breath condensate was collected twice a week from 18 asthmatics and 18 nonasthmatics (ages 14–19 years) attending two New York City schools and analyzed for pH and 8-isoprostane as indicators of airway inflammation and oxidative stress, respectively. Air concentrations of black carbon, a diesel exhaust particle indicator, were measured outside schools. Air measurements of nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and fine particulate matter were obtained for the closest central monitoring sites. Relationships between ambient pollutants and exhaled biomarkers were characterized using mixed effects models. Among all subjects, increases in 1- to 5-day averages of black carbon were associated with decreases in exhaled breath condensate pH, indicating increased airway inflammation, and increases in 8-isoprostane, indicating increased oxidative stress. Increases in 1- to 5-day averages of nitrogen dioxide were associated with increases in 8-isoprostane. Ozone and fine particulate matter were inconsistently associated with exhaled biomarkers. Associations did not differ between asthmatics and nonasthmatics. The findings indicate that short-term exposure to traffic-related air pollutants may increase airway inflammation and/or oxidative stress in urban youth and provide mechanistic support for associations documented between traffic-related pollutant exposures and respiratory morbidity.},

abstract = {Background
Oxidative stress has been implicated as a possible mechanism for adverse health effects associated with traffic emissions. We examined the association of an estimate of traffic emissions with blood biomarkers of antioxidant capacity (glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity) and oxidative damage (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS)) among 1810 healthy women, randomly selected from Erie and Niagara Counties in Western New York.
Methods
A geographic traffic emission and meteorological dispersion model was used to estimate annual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure from traffic emissions for each woman based on her residence at the time of study. Associations of traffic-related PAH exposure with measures of oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity were examined in multiple regression analyses with adjustment for potential confounders.
Results
Higher traffic-related PAH exposure was associated with decreased glutathione and increased glutathione peroxidase. Stronger associations between traffic-related PAH exposure and levels of glutathione and glutathione peroxidase were suggested among nonsmoking women without secondhand smoke exposure, especially among premenopausal nonsmoking women. Associations were also stronger for measurements made in warmer months.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that PAHs or other components of traffic emissions may impact anti-oxidative capacity among healthy women, particularly premenopausal non-smokers without secondhand smoke exposure.},

abstract = {Satellite remote sensing (RS) has emerged as a cutting edge approach for estimating ground level ambient air pollution. Previous studies have reported a high correlation between ground level PM2.5 and NO2 estimated by RS and measurements collected at regulatory monitoring sites. The current study examined associations between air pollution and adverse respiratory and allergic health outcomes using multi-year averages of NO2 and PM2.5 from RS and from regulatory monitoring. RS estimates were derived using satellite measurements from OMI, MODIS, and MISR instruments. Regulatory monitoring data were obtained from Canada's National Air Pollution Surveillance Network. Self-reported prevalence of doctor-diagnosed asthma, current asthma, allergies, and chronic bronchitis were obtained from the Canadian Community Health Survey (a national sample of individuals 12 years of age and older). Multi-year ambient pollutant averages were assigned to each study participant based on their six digit postal code at the time of health survey, and were used as a marker for long-term exposure to air pollution. RS derived estimates of NO2 and PM2.5 were associated with 6–10% increases in respiratory and allergic health outcomes per interquartile range (3.97 $\mu$g m−3 for PM2.5 and 1.03 ppb for NO2) among adults (aged 20–64) in the national study population. Risk estimates for air pollution and respiratory/allergic health outcomes based on RS were similar to risk estimates based on regulatory monitoring for areas where regulatory monitoring data were available (within 40 km of a regulatory monitoring station). RS derived estimates of air pollution were also associated with adverse health outcomes among participants residing outside the catchment area of the regulatory monitoring network (p < 0.05). The consistency between risk estimates based on RS and regulatory monitoring as well as the associations between air pollution and health among participants living outside the catchment area for regulatory monitoring suggest that RS can provide useful estimates of long-term ambient air pollution in epidemiologic studies. This is particularly important in rural communities and other areas where monitoring and modeled air pollution data are limited or unavailable.},

abstract = {Consistent evidence has indicated that the exposure to environmental air pollution increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to evaluate the possible effects of occupational exposure to air pollution, especially to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and the influence of co-morbidities on the atherosclerotic process and inflammation. For that, biomarkers of exposure such as 1-hydroxypyrene urinary, oxidative damage and markers of cardiovascular risk were determined in plasma, serum and blood. In addition, inflammation models such as carotid intima-media thickness and serum inflammatory cytokines were analyzed in 58 taxi drivers with and without co-morbidity. The results demonstrated that considering only taxi drivers without co-morbidities, 15% presented carotid intima-media thickness above reference values. For the first time it has been demonstrated that urinary 1-hydroxypyrene levels were associated with carotid intima-media thickness and with serum homocysteine levels. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that several factors may contribute to the increased carotid intima-media thickness, among which age, interleukin-6, fibrinogen and exposure to PAHs stand out. In summary, our results suggest that chronic occupational exposure to atmospheric pollution could be an additional contributor to the atherogenesis process, leading to impaired vascular health. Moreover, carotid intima-media thickness, serum homocysteine levels, fibrinogen and the total cholesterol/HDL-c ratio could be suggested as preventive measures to monitor drivers' health.},

PM10 acetone extracts were toxic and did not elicit cytokine release; aqueous extracts were less toxic and stimulated the release of IL-6 and IL-8.

Citywide air pollution mitigation program during the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, China, provided such an opportunity. Daily mortality from non-accidental, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases was compared for 51 intervention days (November 1–December 21) in 2010 with the same calendar date of baseline years (2006–2009 and 2011). Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were estimated using a time series Poisson model, adjusting for day of week, public holidays, daily mean temperature and relative humidity. Daily PM10 (particle with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 $\mu$m) decreased from 88.64 $\mu$g/m3 during the baseline period to 80.61 $\mu$g/m3 during the Asian Games period. Other measured air pollutants and weather variables did not differ substantially. Daily mortality from non-accidental, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases decreased from 32, 11 and 6 during the baseline period to 25, 8 and 5 during the Games period, the corresponding RR for the Games period compared with the baseline period was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73–0.86), 0.77 (95% CI: 0.66–0.89) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.57–0.80), respectively. No significant decreases were observed in other months of 2010 in Guangzhou and intervention period in two control cities. This finding supports the efforts to reduce air pollution and improve public health through transportation restriction and industrial emission control.},

abstract = {Objective
The acute cardiorespiratory effects of air quality among children living in areas with considerable heavy industry have not been well investigated. We conducted a panel study of children with asthma living in proximity to an industrial complex housing two refineries in Montreal, Quebec, in order to assess associations between their personal daily exposure to air pollutants and changes in pulmonary function and selected indicators of cardiovascular health.
Methods
Seventy-two children with asthma age 7–12 years in 2009–2010 participated in this panel study for a period of 10 consecutive days. They carried a small backpack for personal monitoring of sulphur dioxide (SO2), benzene, fine particles (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and underwent daily spirometry and cardiovascular testing (blood pressure, pulse rate and oxygen saturation). To estimate these associations, we used mixed regression models, adjusting for within-subject serial correlation, and for the effects of a number of personal and environmental variables (e.g., medication use, ethnicity, temperature).
Results
Children with asthma involved in the study had relatively good pulmonary function test results (mean FEV1 compared to standard values: 89.8%, mean FVC: 97.6%, mean FEF25–75: 76.3%). Median diastolic, systolic blood pressures and oxygen saturation were 60/94mmHg and 99%, respectively. Median personal concentrations of pollutants were NO2, 5.5ppb; benzene, 2.1µg/m3; PM2.5, 5.7µg/m3; and total PAH, 130µg/m3. Most personal concentrations of SO2 were below the level of detection. No consistent associations were observed between cardio-pulmonary indices and personal exposure to PM2.5, NO2 and benzene, although there was a suggestion for a small decrease in respiratory function with total concentrations of PAHs (e.g., adjusted association with FVC: −9.9ml per interquartile range 95%CI: −23.4, 3.7).
Conclusions
This study suggests that at low daily average levels of exposure to industrial emissions, effects on pulmonary and cardiovascular functions in children with asthma may be difficult to detect over 10 consecutive days.},

Recent studies indicated that the aging, human neurodegenerative diseases and cancers resulted from mitochondrial dysfunction and OS. The purpose of this study is to provide a probabilistic risk assessment model to quantify the atmospheric diesel exhaust particles (DEP)-induced pre-cancer biomarker response and cancer incidence risk for residents in south Taiwan. We conducted entirely monthly particulate matter sampling data at five sites in Kaohsiung of south Taiwan in the period 2002–2003. Three findings were found: (i) the DEP dose estimates and cancer risk quantification had heterogeneously spatiotemporal difference in south Taiwan, (ii) the pre-cancer DNA damage biomarker and cancer incidence estimates had a positive yet insignificant association, and (iii) all the estimates of cancer incidence in south Taiwan populations fell within and slight lower than the values from previous cancer epidemiological investigations. In this study, we successfully assessed the tumor incidence for residents posed by DEP exposure in south Taiwan compared with the epidemiological approach. Our approach provides a unique way for assessing human health risk for residences exposed to atmospheric DEP depending on specific combinations of local and regional conditions. Our work implicates the importance of incorporating both environmental and health risk impacts into models of air pollution exposure to guide adaptive mitigation strategies.},

abstract = {Purpose
To quantify ocular symptoms, goblet cells (GC) and mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) gene expression on the conjunctiva of healthy subjects exposed to ambient levels of traffic-derived air pollution and to estimate its correlation with NO2 and particulate matter smaller than 2.5$\mu$m (PM2.5) levels.
Methods
Twenty-one taxi drivers or traffic controllers were assessed with the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire and conjunctival impression cytology. MUC5AC mRNA levels were determined based on the cytology of the right eye, and GC density was assessed based on the cytology of the left eye. Mean individual levels of 24-h NO2 and PM2.5 exposure were assessed the day before examination. Possible associations between NO2 or PM2.5 levels, OSDI scores, GC densities and MUC5AC mRNA levels were verified.
Results
The subjects were exposed to mean PM2.5 levels of 35±12$\mu$g/m3 and mean NO2 levels of 189±47$\mu$g/m3. OSDI scores were low (7.4±8) and GC densities were 521±257 and 782±322 cell/mm2 on the bulbar and tarsal conjunctivas, respectively. The mean GC-derived MUC5AC mRNA expression was 14±7fM/$\mu$g of total RNA. A significant and positive correlation was observed between MUC5AC mRNA levels and tarsal GC density (p=0.018). A trend toward association between PM2.5 levels and tarsal GC cell density (p=0.052) was found.
Conclusion
Exposure to ambient levels of air pollution impacts conjunctival GC density. An increase in MUC5AC mRNA levels may be part of an adaptive ocular surface response to long-term exposure to air pollution.},

abstract = {Based on recent understanding of PM2.5 health-related problems from fossil-fueled power plants emission inventories collected in Taiwan, we have determined the loss of life expectancy (LLE) and the lifetime (75-year) risks for PM2.5 health-related mortalities as attributed to the operation of the world's largest coal-fired power plant; the Taichung Power Plant (TCP), with an installed nominal electrical capacity of 5780 MW in 2013. Five plausible scenarios (combinations of emission controls, fuel switch, and relocation) and two risk factors were considered. It is estimated that the lifetime (75-y) risk for all-cause mortality was 0.3%–0.6% for males and 0.2%–0.4% for females, and LLE at 84 days in 1997 for the 23 million residents of Taiwan. The risk has been reduced to one-fourth at 0.05%–0.10% for males and 0.03%–0.06% for females, and LLE at 15 days in 2007, which was mainly attributed to the installation of desulfurization and de-NOx equipment. Moreover, additional improvements can be expected if we can relocate the power plant to a downwind site on Taiwan, and convert the fuel source from coal to natural gas. The risk can be significantly reduced further to one-fiftieth at 0.001%–0.002% for males and 0.001% for females, and LLE at 0.3 days. Nonetheless, it is still an order higher than the commonly accepted elevated-cancer risk at 0.0001% (10−6), indicating that the PM2.5 health-related risk for operating such a world-class power plant is not negligible. In addition, this study finds that a better-chosen site (involving moving the plant to the leeward side of Taiwan) can reduce the risk significantly as opposed to solely transitioning the fuel source to natural gas. Note that the fuel cost of using natural gas (0.11 USD/kWh in 2013) in Taiwan is about twice the price of using coal fuel (0.05 USD/kWh in 2013).},

Over the last decade, there is growing evidence that exposure to air pollution may be associated with increased risk for congenital malformations.
Objectives
To evaluate the possible association between exposures to air pollution during pregnancy and congenital malformations among infants born following spontaneously conceived (SC) pregnancies and assisted reproductive technology (ART) pregnancies.
Methods
This is an historical cohort study comprising 216,730 infants: 207,825 SC infants and 8905 ART conceived infants, during the periods 1997–2004. Air pollution data including sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter <10µm (PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone (O3) were obtained from air monitoring stations database for the study period. Using a geographic information system (GIS) and the Kriging procedure, exposure to air pollution during the first trimester and the entire pregnancy was assessed for each woman according to her residential location. Logistic regression models with generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach were used to evaluate the adjusted risk for congenital malformations.
Results
In the study cohort increased concentrations of PM10 and NOx pollutants in the entire pregnancy were associated with slightly increased risk for congenital malformations: OR 1.06(95% CI, 1.01–1.11) for 10µg/m3 increase in PM10 and OR 1.03(95% CI, 1.01–1.04) for 10ppb increase in NOx. Specific malformations were evident in the circulatory system (for PM10 and NOx exposure) and genital organs (for NOx exposure). SO2 and O3 pollutants were not significantly associated with increased risk for congenital malformations. In the ART group higher concentrations of SO2 and O3 in entire pregnancy were associated (although not significantly) with an increased risk for congenital malformations: OR 1.06(95% CI, 0.96–1.17) for 1ppb increase in SO2 and OR 1.15(95% CI, 0.69–1.91) for 10ppb increase in O3.
Conclusions
Exposure to higher levels of PM10 and NOx during pregnancy was associated with an increased risk for congenital malformations. Specific malformations were evident in the circulatory system and genital organs. Among ART pregnancies possible adverse association of SO2 and O3 exposure was also observed. Further studies are warranted, including more accurate exposure assessment and a larger sample size for ART pregnancies, in order to confirm these findings.},

Consensus is growing on the need to investigate the joint effects of psychosocial stress and environmental hazards on health. Some evidence suggests that psychosocial stress may be an important modifier of the association between air pollution respiratory outcomes, but few have examined cardiovascular outcomes.
Objectives
We examined the modifying effect of psychosocial stress on the association between fine particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) and blood pressure (BP).
Methods
Our data came from the Detroit Healthy Environments Partnership (HEP) 2002–2003 survey. Of 919 participants, BP was collected at two time points in a subset of 347. Building on previous work reporting associations between PM2.5 and BP in this sample, we regressed systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP and pulse pressure (PP), in separate linear models, on the interaction among psychosocial stress, PM2.5, and HEP neighborhood (Southwest, Eastside, Northwest).
Results
The association between PM2.5 and SBP was stronger for those who reported high levels of stress, but this interaction was significant only in the Southwest Detroit neighborhood. Southwest Detroit residents who reported low stress showed 2.94mmHg (95% CI: −0.85, 6.72) increase in SBP for each 10$\mu$g/m3 increase in 2-day prior PM2.5 exposure. Those who reported high stress showed 9.05mmHg (95% CI: 3.29, 14.81) increase in SBP for each 10$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure.
Conclusions
These results suggest that psychosocial stress may increase vulnerability to the hypertensive effects of PM2.5. This work contributes to an understanding of the ways in which the social and physical environments may jointly contribute to poor health and to health disparities.},

abstract = {Objectives
This study aims to examine whether changes in short-term exposures to particulate matter are associated with changes in lung function, breath rate, and blood pressure among healthy adults and whether smoking status modifies the association.
Methods
We took advantage of the artificially controlled changes in air pollution levels that occurred during the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China and conducted a panel study of 201 Beijing residents. Data were collected before, during, and after the Olympics, respectively. Linear mixed-effect models and generalized estimating equation models were used to compare measurements of peak expiratory flow, breath rate and blood pressure across three time points.
Results
The mean values of peak expiratory flow were 346.0L/min, 399.3L/min, and 364.1L/min over the three study periods. Peak expiratory flow levels increased in 78% of the participants when comparing the during- with pre- Olympics time points, while peak expiratory flow levels decreased in 80% of participants for the post- and during-Olympic periods comparison. In subgroup analyses comparing the during-Olympic to pre-Olympic time points, we found a larger percentage change in peak expiratory flow (+17%) among female, younger and non-smoking participants than among male, elderly and smoking participants (+12%). The percentage of participants with a fast breath rate (>20/min) changed from 9.7% to 4.9% to 30.1% among females, and from 7.9% to 2.6% to 27.3% among males over the three time points. The changes in blood pressure over the three study periods were not very clear, although there is an increase in diastolic pressure and a decrease in pulse pressure among males during the games.
Conclusions
The results suggest that exposure to different air pollution levels has significant effects on respiratory function. Smoking, age and gender appear to modify participants׳ biological response to changes in air quality.},

Exposure to traffic pollution has been linked to numerous adverse health endpoints. Despite this, limited data examining traffic exposures during realistic commutes and acute response exists.
Objectives
We conducted the Atlanta Commuters Exposures (ACE-1) Study, an extensive panel-based exposure and health study, to measure chemically-resolved in-vehicle exposures and corresponding changes in acute oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, pulmonary and systemic inflammation and autonomic response.
Methods
We recruited 42 adults (21 with and 21 without asthma) to conduct two 2-h scripted highway commutes during morning rush hour in the metropolitan Atlanta area. A suite of in-vehicle particulate components were measured in the subjects' private vehicles. Biomarker measurements were conducted before, during, and immediately after the commutes and in 3 hourly intervals after commutes.
Results
At measurement time points within 3h after the commute, we observed mild to pronounced elevations relative to baseline in exhaled nitric oxide, C-reactive-protein, and exhaled malondialdehyde, indicative of pulmonary and systemic inflammation and oxidative stress initiation, as well as decreases relative to baseline levels in the time-domain heart-rate variability parameters, SDNN and rMSSD, indicative of autonomic dysfunction. We did not observe any detectable changes in lung function measurements (FEV1, FVC), the frequency-domain heart-rate variability parameter or other systemic biomarkers of vascular injury. Water soluble organic carbon was associated with changes in eNO at all post-commute time-points (p<0.0001).
Conclusions
Our results point to measureable changes in pulmonary and autonomic biomarkers following a scripted 2-h highway commute.},

@article{Boldo2014,
abstract = {Background
In recent years, Spain has implemented a number of air quality control measures that are expected to lead to a future reduction in fine particle concentrations and an ensuing positive impact on public health.
Objectives
We aimed to assess the impact on mortality attributable to a reduction in fine particle levels in Spain in 2014 in relation to the estimated level for 2007.
Methods
To estimate exposure, we constructed fine particle distribution models for Spain for 2007 (reference scenario) and 2014 (projected scenario) with a spatial resolution of 16×16km2. In a second step, we used the concentration–response functions proposed by cohort studies carried out in Europe (European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects and Rome longitudinal cohort) and North America (American Cancer Society cohort, Harvard Six Cities study and Canadian national cohort) to calculate the number of attributable annual deaths corresponding to all causes, all non-accidental causes, ischemic heart disease and lung cancer among persons aged over 25 years (2005–2007 mortality rate data). We examined the effect of the Spanish demographic shift in our analysis using 2007 and 2012 population figures.
Results
Our model suggested that there would be a mean overall reduction in fine particle levels of 1µg/m3 by 2014. Taking into account 2007 population data, between 8 and 15 all-cause deaths per 100,000 population could be postponed annually by the expected reduction in fine particle levels. For specific subgroups, estimates varied from 10 to 30 deaths for all non-accidental causes, from 1 to 5 for lung cancer, and from 2 to 6 for ischemic heart disease. The expected burden of preventable mortality would be even higher in the future due to the Spanish population growth. Taking into account the population older than 30 years in 2012, the absolute mortality impact estimate would increase approximately by 18%.
Conclusions
Effective implementation of air quality measures in Spain, in a scenario with a short-term projection, would amount to an appreciable decline in fine particle concentrations, and this, in turn, would lead to notable health-related benefits. Recent European cohort studies strengthen the evidence of an association between long-term exposure to fine particles and health effects, and could enhance the health impact quantification in Europe. Air quality models can contribute to improved assessment of air pollution health impact estimates, particularly in study areas without air pollution monitoring data.},

abstract = {Background
Biomass smoke at higher concentrations is associated with respiratory symptoms and, after years of exposure, increased risk of respiratory disorders in adults, but its effects on cardiovascular diseases are not well characterized, particularly compared with other pollution sources like tobacco smoke or traffic.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study and enrolled 25 women living in rural Sichuan, China. We measured integrated 24-h personal exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon, and measured PM2.5 and black carbon in their kitchens. We assessed participants' brachial and central blood pressure and arterial stiffness using pulse wave analysis, and analyzed dried blood spot and buccal cell samples for C-reactive protein and relative telomere length. We also evaluated the difference in these physiological and biomarker measures between individuals with high (≥median) versus low (<median) PM2.5 exposure using multivariate regression.
Results
Geometric mean 24-h PM2.5 and black carbon exposures were 61µg/m3 (95% CI: 48, 78) and 3.2µg/m3 (95% CI: 2.3, 4.5), respectively. Average kitchen PM2.5 and black carbon concentrations were only moderately correlated with personal exposures (PM2.5: r=0.41; black carbon: r=0.63), although they had similar means. Women in the high and low exposure groups were similar in age, obesity, socioeconomic status, salt intake, and physical activity. Women in the high PM2.5 exposure group had higher mean brachial systolic blood pressure (SBP; difference=4.6mmHg, 95% CI −7.8, 16.9), central SBP (difference=3.1mmHg, 95% CI: −8.4, 14.5), central pulse pressure (difference=4.1mmHg; 95% CI: −4.2, 12.4), and augmentation index (difference=2.8%, 95% CI: −1.6, 7.2). High exposed women had 43% shorter telomere length (95% CI: −113, 28) than that of women in the low exposure group. There were no differences in pulse wave velocity or C-reactive protein between the two exposure groups. None of the results was statistically significant.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that it is feasible to measure markers of vascular function and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress in field studies of biomass smoke. Although many of the associations were in the expected direction, larger studies would be needed to establish the effects.},

abstract = {Background
Air pollution has been shown to have adverse effects on many health outcomes including cardiorespiratory diseases and cancer. However, evidence on the effects of prenatal exposure is still limited. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study is to evaluate the effects of prenatal exposure to air pollutants including particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5$\mu$m (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) on the risk of adverse birth outcomes (ABOs) including term low birth weight (LBW), preterm delivery (PTD) and very PTD (VPTD).
Methods
singleton births from 2004 to 2005 in Florida were included in the study (N=423,719). Trimester-specific exposures to O3 and PM2.5 at maternal residence at delivery were estimated using the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network data, which were interpolated using Hierarchical Bayesian models.
Results
After adjustment for potential confounders such as demographics, medical and lifestyle factors PM2.5 exposures in all trimesters were found to be significantly and positively associated with the risk of all ABOs. Second-trimester exposure had the strongest effects. For an interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5 during the second trimester, the risk of term LBW, PTD and VPTD increased by 3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1–6%)], 12% (11–14%) and 22% (18–25%), respectively. O3 was also found to be positively associated with PTD and VPTD with the strongest effects over the whole pregnancy period [3% (1–5%) for PTD and 13% (7–19%) for VPTD for each IQR increase]. However, O3 was observed to have protective effects on term LBW. Results were consistent for multi-pollutant models.
Conclusion
PM2.5 has consistent adverse effects on ABOs whereas O3 has inconsistent effects. These findings warrant further investigation.},

Do{\~{n}}a Ana County in New Mexico regularly experiences severe air pollution episodes associated with windblown dust and fires. Residents of Hispanic/Latino origin constitute the largest population group in the region. We investigated the associations of ambient particulate matter and ozone with hospital emergency room and admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular visits in adults.
Methods
We used trajectories regression analysis to determine the local and regional components of particle mass and ozone. We applied Poisson generalized models to analyze hospital emergency room visits and admissions adjusted for pollutant levels, humidity, temperature and temporal and seasonal effects.
Results
We found that the sources within 500km of the study area accounted for most of particle mass and ozone concentrations. Sources in Southeast Texas, Baja California and Southwest US were the most important regional contributors. Increases of cardiovascular emergency room visits were estimated for PM10 (3.1% (95% CI: −0.5 to 6.8)) and PM10−2.5 (2.8% (95% CI: −0.2 to 5.9)) for all adults during the warm period (April–September). When high PM10 (>150$\mu$g/m3) mass concentrations were excluded, strong effects for respiratory emergency room visits for both PM10 (3.2% (95% CI: 0.5–6.0)) and PM2.5 (5.2% (95% CI: −0.5 to 11.3)) were computed.
Conclusions
Our analysis indicated effects of PM10, PM2.5 and O3 on emergency room visits during the April–September period in a region impacted by windblown dust and wildfires.},

abstract = {Few studies on size-specific health effects of particulate matter have been conducted in Asia. We examined the association between both fine and coarse particles (PM2.5 and PM10−2.5) and mortality across 11 East Asian cities from 4 countries (Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and China). We performed a two-stage analysis: we generated city-specific estimates using a time-series analysis with a generalized additive model (Quasi-Poisson distribution), and estimated the overall effects by conducting a meta-analysis. Each 10−$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 (lag01) was associated with an increase of 0.38% (95% confidence interval = 0.21%–0.55%) in all causes mortality, 0.96% (0.46%–1.46%) in cardiovascular mortality, and 1% (0.23%–1.78%) in respiratory mortality. Each 10−$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10−2.5 (lag01) was associated with cardiovascular mortality (0.69%, [0.05%–1.33%]), although this association attenuated after controlling for other pollutants, especially PM2.5. Increased mortality was associated with increasing PM2.5 and PM10−2.5 concentrations over 11 East Asian cities.},

In this research, the relationship between exposures to ambient levels of PM in the 10 micron (PM10) and 2.5 micron (PM2.5) size fractions and health outcomes in members of the healthy, young-adult subgroup who are 18–39 years of age was examined. Active duty military personnel populations at three strategically selected military bases in the United States were used as a surrogate to the control group. Health outcome data, which consists of the number of diagnoses for each of nine International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) categories related to respiratory illness, were derived from outpatient visits at each of the three military bases. Data on ambient concentrations of particulate matter, specifically PM10 and PM2.5, were obtained for these sites. The health outcome data were correlated and regressed with the PM10 and PM2.5 data, and other air quality and weather-related data on a daily and weekly basis for the period 1998 to 2004. Results indicate that at Fort Bliss, which is a US Environmental Protection Agency designated non-attainment area for PM10, a statistically significant association exists between the weekly-averaged number of adverse health effects in the young and healthy adult population and the corresponding weekly-average ambient PM10 concentration. A least squares regression analysis was performed on the Fort Bliss data sets indicated that the health outcome data is related to several environmental parameters in addition to PM10. Overall, the analysis estimates a .6% increase in the weekly rate of emergency room visits for upper respiratory infections for every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in the weekly-averaged PM10 concentration above the mean. The findings support the development of policy and guidance opportunities that can be developed to mitigate exposures to particulate matter.},

abstract = {Objectives
A relationship between ambient air pollution and adverse birth outcomes has been found in a large number of studies that have mainly used a nearest monitor methodology. Recent research has suggested that the effect size may have been underestimated in these studies. This paper examines associations between birth outcomes and ambient levels of residential and workplace sulphur dioxide, particulates and Nitrogen Dioxide estimated using an alternative method – pollution climate mapping.
Methods
Risk of low birthweight and mean birthweight (for n=21,843 term births) and risk of preterm birth (for n=23,086 births) were modelled against small area annual mean ambient air pollution concentrations at work and residence location adjusting for potential confounding factors for singleton live births (1994–2008) across Scotland.
Results
Odds ratios of low birthweight of 1.02 (95% CI, 1.01–1.03) and 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01–1.12) with concentration increases of 1µg/m3 for NO2 and PM10 respectively. Raised but insignificant risks of very preterm birth were found with PM10 (relative risk ratio=1.08; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.17 per 1µg/m3) and NO2 (relative risk ratio=1.01; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.03 per 1µg/m3). An inverse association between mean birthweight and mean annual NO2(−1.24g; 95% CI, −2.02 to −0.46 per 1µg/m3) and PM10 (−5.67g; 95% CI, −9.47 to −1.87 per 1µg/m3). SO2 showed no significant associations.
Conclusions
This study highlights the association between air pollution exposure and reduced newborn size at birth. Together with other recent work it also suggests that exposure estimation based on the nearest monitor method may have led to an under-estimation of the effect size of pollutants on birth outcomes.},

abstract = {Background
Air pollution has been linked to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) but no studies have evaluated impact of preconception and early pregnancy air pollution exposures on GDM risk.
Methods
Electronic medical records provided data on 219,952 singleton deliveries to mothers with (n=11,334) and without GDM (n=208,618). Average maternal exposures to particulate matter (PM) ≤ 2.5$\mu$m (PM2.5) and PM2.5 constituents, PM ≤ 10$\mu$m (PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3) were estimated for the 3-month preconception window, first trimester, and gestational weeks 1–24 based on modified Community Multiscale Air Quality models for delivery hospital referral regions. Binary regression models with robust standard errors estimated relative risks (RR) for GDM per interquartile range (IQR) increase in pollutant concentrations adjusted for study site, maternal age and race/ethnicity.
Results
Preconception maternal exposure to NOX (RR=1.09, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.13) and SO2 (RR=1.05, 1.01, 1.09) were associated with increased risk of subsequent GDM and risk estimates remained elevated for first trimester exposure. Preconception O3 was associated with lower risk of subsequent GDM (RR=0.93, 0.90, 0.96) but risks increased later in pregnancy.
Conclusion
Maternal exposures to NOx and SO2 preconception and during the first few weeks of pregnancy were associated with increased GDM risk. O3 appeared to increase GDM risk in association with mid-pregnancy exposure but not in earlier time windows. These common exposures merit further investigation.},

Fewer studies focus on IHD morbidities and PM2.5, especially in Asia. To explore the associations between short-term exposure to air pollution and morbidities and mortalities from IHD, we conducted a time series study using a generalized additive model that regressed the daily numbers of IHD mortalities and hospital admissions on daily mean concentrations of the following air pollutants: nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 $\mu$m (PM10), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). The relative risks (RR) of IHD deaths and hospital admissions per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in the concentration of each air pollutant were derived in single pollutant models. Multipollutant models were also constructed to estimate their RRs controlling for other pollutants. Significant RRs were observed for all five air pollutants, ranging from 1.008 to 1.032 per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in air pollutant concentrations for IHD mortality and from 1.006 to 1.021 per 10 $\mu$g/m3 for hospital admissions for IHD. In the multipollutant model, only NO2 remained significant for IHD mortality while SO2 and PM2.5 was significantly associated with hospital admissions. This study provides additional evidence that mortalities and hospital admissions for IHD are significantly associated with air pollution. However, we cannot attribute these health effects to a specific air pollutant, owing to high collinearity between some air pollutants.},

abstract = {Summary
Background
Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are important events during disease procedure. AECOPD have negative effect on patients' quality of life, symptoms and lung function, and result in high socioeconomic costs. Though previous studies have demonstrated the significant association between outdoor air pollution and AECOPD hospitalizations, little is known about the spatial relationship utilized a spatial analyzing technique- Geographical Information System (GIS).
Objective
Using GIS to investigate the spatial association between ambient air pollution and AECOPD hospitalizations in Jinan City, 2009.
Methods
414 AECOPD hospitalization cases in Jinan, 2009 were enrolled in our analysis. Monthly concentrations of five monitored air pollutants (NO2, SO2, PM10, O3, CO) during January 2009–December 2009 were provided by Environmental Protection Agency of Shandong Province. Each individual was geocoded in ArcGIS10.0 software. The spatial distribution of five pollutants and the temporal-spatial specific air pollutants exposure level for each individual was estimated by ordinary Kriging model. Spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran's I) was employed to explore the spatial association between ambient air pollutants and AECOPD hospitalizations. A generalized linear model (GLM) using a Poisson distribution with log-link function was used to construct a core model.
Results
At residence, concentrations of SO2, PM10, NO2, CO, O3 and AECOPD hospitalization cases showed statistical significant spatially clustered. The Z-score of SO2, PM10, CO, O3, NO2 at residence is 15.88, 13.93, 12.60, 4.02, 2.44 respectively, while at workplace, concentrations of PM10, SO2, O3, CO and AECOPD hospitalization cases showed statistical significant spatially clustered. The Z-score of PM10, SO2, O3, CO at workplace is 11.39, 8.07, 6.10, and 5.08 respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders in the model, only the PM10 concentrations at workplace showed statistical significance, with a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase of PM10 at workplace associated with a 7% (95%CI: [3.3%, 10%]) increase of hospitalizations due to AECOPD.
Conclusions
Ambient air pollution is correlated with AECOPD hospitalizations spatially. A 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase of PM10 at workplace was associated with a 7% (95%CI: [3.3%, 10%]) increase of hospitalizations due to AECOPD in Jinan, 2009. As a spatial data processing tool, GIS has novel and great potential on air pollutants exposure assessment and spatial analysis in AECOPD research.},

Maternal air pollution exposure has been related to orofacial clefts but the literature is equivocal. Potential chronic preconception effects have not been studied.
Objectives
Criteria air pollutant exposure during three months preconception and gestational weeks 3–8 was studied in relation to orofacial defects.
Methods
Among 188,102 live births and fetal deaths from the Consortium on Safe Labor (2002–2008), 63 had isolated cleft palate (CP) and 159 had isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL ±CP). Exposures were estimated using a modified Community Multiscale Air Quality model. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations adjusted for site/region and maternal demographic, lifestyle and clinical factors calculated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI per interquartile increase in each pollutant.
Results
Preconception, carbon monoxide (CO; OR=2.24; CI: 1.21, 4.16) and particulate matter (PM) ≤10µm (OR=1.72; CI: 1.12, 2.66) were significantly associated with CP, while sulfur dioxide (SO2) was associated with CL ±CP (OR=1.93; CI: 1.16, 3.21). During gestational weeks 3–8, CO remained a significant risk for CP (OR=2.74; CI: 1.62, 4.62) and nitrogen oxides (NOx; OR=3.64; CI: 1.73, 7.66) and PM ≤2.5µm (PM2.5; OR=1.74; CI: 1.15, 2.64) were also related to the risk. Analyses by individual week revealed that positive associations of NOx and PM2.5 with CP were most prominent from weeks 3–6 and 3–5, respectively.
Conclusions
Exposure to several criteria air pollutants preconception and during early gestation was associated with elevated odds for CP, while CL ±CP was only associated with preconception SO2 exposure.},

Epidemiological studies have shown effects of long-term exposure to air pollution on cardiovascular and respiratory health. However, studies investigating the effects of air pollution on cognition and brain function are limited. We investigated if neurocognitive functions are associated with air pollution exposure and whether apolipoprotein E (ApoE) alleles modify the association of air pollution exposure with cognition.
Methods
We investigated 789 women from the SALIA cohort during the 22-year follow-up examination (2008–2009). Exposure to particulate matter (PM) size fractions and nitrogen oxides (NOx) were assigned to home addresses. Traffic indicators were used to assess residential proximity to high traffic load. Level of cognitive performance was assessed using the CERAD-Plus test. Air pollution effects on cognitive functioning were estimated cross-sectionally using adjusted linear regression models.
Results
Air pollution was negatively associated with cognitive function and cognitive performance in the subtests for semantic memory and visuo-construction. Significant associations could be observed for figure copying with an interquartile range increase of NO2 ($\beta$=–0.28 (95%CI:–0.44;–0.12)), NOx ($\beta$=–0.25 (95%CI:–0.40;–0.09)), PM10 ($\beta$=–0.14 (95%CI:–0.26;–0.02)) and PM2.5 ($\beta$=–0.19 (95%CI:–0.36;–0.02)). The association with traffic load was significant in carriers of one or two ApoE ɛ4 risk alleles.
Conclusion
In this study of elderly women, markers of air pollution were associated with cognitive impairment in the visuospatial domain. The association of traffic exposure is significant in participants carrying the ApoE $\epsilon$4 risk allele.},

Short-term associations between size-fractionated particulate matter (PM) air pollution and circulating biomarkers are not well established, especially among diabetes patients.
Methods
We conducted a longitudinal panel study involving 6 repeated measurements of 12 circulating biomarkers among 35 diabetes patients from April to June, 2013 in Shanghai, China. Real-time number and mass concentrations of PM with multiple size fractions between 0.25 and 10$\mu$m were measured. Linear mixed-effect models were used to explore the associations between size-fractionated PM concentrations and blood biomarkers at different time windows.
Results
Short-term exposure to PM was significantly associated with elevated levels of 5 biomarkers of inflammation, 3 biomarkers of coagulation and 1 vasoconstrictor. The effects varied considerably by particle size and time windows. Overall, PM with smaller size had stronger associations, and the most significant size fractions were 0.25–0.40$\mu$m. Even 2h exposure to PM can lead to a significant increase in biomarkers. The effects on biomarkers of inflammation and vasoconstriction were restricted to the first 12h after exposure, but the effects on coagulation persisted for 24–72h. For example, an interquartile range increase in 2h average exposure to PM0.25–0.40 was associated with 6–20% increase in biomarkers of inflammation, 19–38% in coagulation and 17% in vasoconstriction. PM had a stronger effect among male patients than female patients.
Conclusions
Our results provided important evidence on the roles of the size and time windows of exposure in the PM-mediated effects on circulating biomarkers of inflammation, coagulation and vasoconstriction in diabetes patients in China.},

abstract = {Background and aims
A landfill, an incinerator, and a refinery plant have been operating since the early 1960s in a contaminated site located in the suburb of Rome (Italy). To evaluate their potential health effects, a population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted using dispersion modeling for exposure assessment.
Methods
A fixed cohort was enrolled in the Rome Longitudinal Study in 2001, mortality and hospitalizations were followed-up until 2010. Exposure assessments to the landfill (H2S), the incinerator (PM10), and the refinery plant (SOX) were performed for each subject using a Lagrangian dispersion model. Individual and small-area variables were available (including exposures levels to NO2 from traffic and diesel trucks). Cox regression analysis was performed (hazard ratios, HRs, 95% CI) using linear terms for the exposures (5th–95th percentiles difference). Single and bi-pollutant models were run.
Results
The cohort included 85,559 individuals. The estimated annual average exposures levels were correlated. H2S from the landfill was associated with cardiovascular hospital admissions in both genders (HR 1.04 95% CI 1.00–1.09 in women); PM10 from the incinerator was associated with pancreatic cancer mortality in both genders (HR 1.40 95% CI 1.03–1.90 in men, HR 1.47 95% CI 1.12–1.93 in women) and with breast morbidity in women (HR 1.13 95% CI 1.00–1.27). SOx from the refinery was associated with laryngeal cancer mortality in women (HR 4.99 95% CI 1.64–15.9) and respiratory hospital admissions (HR 1.13 95% CI 1.01–1.27).
Conclusions
We found an association of the pollution sources with some cancer forms and cardio-respiratory diseases. Although there was a high correlation between the estimated exposures, an indication of specific effects from the different sources emerged.},

abstract = {This study, Part II of the larger study “Children's exposure to indoor air in urban nurseries”, aimed to: (i) evaluate nursery schools' indoor concentrations of several air pollutants in class and lunch rooms; and (ii) analyse them according to guidelines and references. Indoor continuous measurements were performed, and outdoor concentrations were obtained to determine indoor/outdoor ratios. The influence of outdoor air seemed to be determinant on carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) indoor concentrations. The peak concentrations of formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds (VOC) registered (highest concentrations of 204 and 2320µgm−3 respectively), indicated the presence of specific indoor sources of these pollutants, namely materials emitting formaldehyde and products emitting VOC associated to cleaning and children's specific activities (like paints and glues). For formaldehyde, baseline constant concentrations along the day were also found in some of the studied rooms, which enhances the importance of detailing the study of children's short and long-term exposure to this indoor air pollutant. While CO, NO2 and O3 never exceeded the national and international reference values for IAQ and health protection, exceedances were found for formaldehyde and VOC. For this reason, a health risk assessment approach could be interesting for future research to assess children's health risks of exposure to formaldehyde and to VOC concentrations in nursery schools. Changing cleaning schedules and materials emitting formaldehyde, and more efficient ventilation while using products emitting VOC, with the correct amount and distribution of fresh air, would decrease children's exposure.},

Several studies have shown that there may be temporal variation in PM short-term effect on mortality. This temporal pattern may play an important role in evaluating air quality policies.
Objectives
We investigated temporal variation in the association between PM and mortality in Seoul, Korea, 1998–2011.
Methods
We adopted a generalized additive model and a series of time windows of five years to analyze temporal variation in associations between PM and all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. This time-window approach offers not only a comparison between one and the other half period but also successive variation. Time-varying associations were estimated only for days without Asian dust (dust storm blown from the Gobi desert) intrusion.
Results
Annual average PM10 and PM2.5 total mass decreased from 70.0 to 46.9µg/m3 and 44.4 to 23.4µg/m3, respectively, during 2001–2011. A 10µg/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with 0.16% (95% CI=−0.03% to 0.35%) additional all-cause deaths in 2002–2006 and it increased to 0.26% (95% CI=0.05–0.48%) in 2007–2011. For PM2.5, the association increased from 0.35% (95% CI=−0.02% to 0.71%) to 0.48% (95% CI=0.08–0.88%). For cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, increasing trends with stronger estimates were found.
Conclusions
The present study showed temporally increasing trends in associations between PM and mortality. Current policies may not be as effective to reducing health risks attributable to PM as expected. Air quality interventions should be encouraged in terms of causal factors for time-varying association between PM and mortality.},

abstract = {Among industrialised countries, fine particle (PM2.5) and ozone levels in the Sydney metropolitan area of Australia are relatively low. Annual mean PM2.5 levels have historically remained below 8$\mu$g/m3 while warm season (November–March) ozone levels occasionally exceed the Australian guideline value of 0.10ppm (daily 1h max). Yet, these levels are still below those seen in the United States and Europe. This analysis focuses on two related questions: (1) what is the public health burden associated with air pollution in Sydney; and (2) to what extent would reducing air pollution reduce the number of hospital admissions, premature deaths and number of years of life lost (YLL)? We addressed these questions by applying a damage function approach to Sydney population, health, PM2.5 and ozone data for 2007 within the BenMAP-CE software tool to estimate health impacts and economic benefits. We found that 430 premature deaths (90% CI: 310–540) and 5800 YLL (95% CI: 3900–7600) are attributable to 2007 levels of PM2.5 (about 2% of total deaths and 1.8% of YLL in 2007). We also estimate about 630 (95% CI: 410–840) respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions attributable to 2007 PM2.5 and ozone exposures. Reducing air pollution levels by even a small amount will yield a range of health benefits. Reducing 2007 PM2.5 exposure in Sydney by 10% would, over 10 years, result in about 650 (95% CI: 430–850) fewer premature deaths, a gain of 3500 (95% CI: 2300–4600) life-years and about 700 (95% CI: 450–930) fewer respiratory and cardiovascular hospital visits. These results suggest that substantial health benefits are attainable in Sydney with even modest reductions in air pollution.},

abstract = {Background
The link between particulate air pollution and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality has been investigated. However, there is little direct evidence that reduction measures which decrease particulate air pollution would lead to a reduction in CVD mortality.
Objectives
In Beijing, China, air quality improvement strategies were developed and actions were taken before and during the 2008 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the aim of the study was to assess the effects of changes in particulate air pollution before (May 20–July 20, 2008), during (August 1–September 20, 2008) and after (October 1–December 1, 2008) the Olympics period.
Methods
Concentrations of air pollution, meteorology and CVD death counts were obtained from official networks and monitoring sites located on the Peking University campus. Air pollution effects with lags of 0–4 days as well as of the 5-day average on cause-specific CVD mortality were investigated for the complete study period (May 20–December 1, 2008) using Quasi-Poisson regression models. Different gender and age subgroups were taken into account. Additionally, effect modification by air mass origin was investigated. In a second step, air pollution effects were estimated for the three specific periods by including an interaction term in the models.
Results
We observed large concentration decreases in all measured air pollutants during the unique pollution intervention for the Beijing 2008 Olympics. For the whole period, adverse effects of particulate air pollution were observed on CVD mortality with a 1-day delay as well as for the 5-day average exposure, e.g. an 8.8% (95%CI: 2.7–15.2%) increase in CVD mortality with an interquartile range increase in ultrafine particles. The effects were more pronounced in females, the elderly and for cerebrovascular deaths, but not modified by air mass origin. The specific sub-period analysis results suggested that the risks of CVD mortality were lowest during the Olympic Games where strongest reduction measures have been applied.
Conclusions
The results indicated that the reduction of air pollution due to air quality control measures led to a decreased risk of CVD mortality in Beijing. Our findings provide new insight into efforts to reduce ambient air pollution.},

abstract = {Background
Starting from early January 2013, northern China was hit by multiple prolonged and severe smog events which were characterized by extremely high-level concentrations of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with hourly peaks of PM2.5 over 800µg/m3. However, the consequences of this severe air pollution are largely unknown. This study investigates the acute effect of the smog episodes and PM2.5 on mortality for both urban and rural areas in northern China.
Data and methods
We collected PM2.5, mortality, and meteorological data for 5 urban city districts and 2 rural counties in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province of China from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013. We employed the generalized additive models to estimate the associations between smog episodes or PM2.5 and daily mortality for each district/county.
Results
Without any meteorological control, the smog episodes are positively and statistically significantly associated with mortality in 5 out of 7 districts/counties. However, the findings are sensitive to the meteorological factors. After controlling for temperature, humidity, dew point and wind, the statistical significance disappears in all urban districts. In contrast, the smog episodes are consistently and statistically significantly associated with higher total mortality and mortality from cardiovascular/respiratory diseases in the two rural counties. In Ji County, a smog episode is associated with 6.94% (95% Confidence Interval, −0.20 to 14.58) increase in overall mortality, and in Ci County it is associated with a 19.26% (95% CI, 6.66–33.34) increase in overall mortality. The smog episodes kill people primarily through its impact on cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. On average, a smog episode is associated with 11.66% (95% CI, 3.12–20.90) increase in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in Ji County, and it is associated with a 22.23% (95% CI, 8.11–38.20) increase in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in Ci County. A 10$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration is associated with 0.88% (95% CI, 0.3–1.46) increase in overall mortality and 1.2% (95% CI, 0.55–1.85) in Ji County. A 10$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration is associated with 0.55% (95% CI, −0.02 to 1.13) increase in overall mortality in Ci County. The findings suggest that the smog episodes and fine particulate have bigger and more detrimental impacts on rural residents, especially for those living close to big and polluted cities.
Conclusions
The smog episodes and PM2.5 are statistically associated with mortality in rural areas of China. The associations for urban areas are not statistically significant.},

abstract = {Study objective
Linkages between pollution and morbidity have been observed in numerous studies. But race/ethnicity has been underemphasized as a modifier of that association, and few studies have tested for a Hispanic Health Paradox in sensitivity to air pollution.
Methods
Daily asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive heart failure (CHF) hospital admissions in El Paso, Texas were studied in age groups and insurance groups. Daily PM2.5 and NO2 were calculated from pollution monitors and all models adjusted for apparent temperature and wind speed. Conditional logistic regression for the case-crossover design was used for a between-group comparison and for a within-group comparison for Hispanics.
Results
Hispanics were at lower risk than non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanics of other races for NO2-associated admissions, but at greater risk for PM2.5-associated admissions. While Hispanics were generally protected with regards to NO2, Hispanic children (vs. Elderly) faced increased risk for asthma and uninsured Hispanics (vs. Private) faced increased risk for COPD admissions. While Hispanics were at increased risk of PM2.5-associated admissions, certain characteristics heightened their risks: being a Hispanic child (vs. Elderly) for asthma; being a Hispanic with Medicare (vs. Private) for asthma; and being a Hispanic with private insurance (vs. all other insurance types) for CHF. The main effect of pollution on admissions was more significant for asthma and CHF than for COPD, which had the fewest cases.
Conclusions
There was heterogeneity in sensitivity to air pollution based on social characteristics and moderate evidence for a Hispanic Health Paradox in sensitivity to NO2.},

We investigated maternal exposure to particulate matter (PM10) in association with birth weight and fetus growth with a focus on the shape of the association and gestational age at birth as a potential effect modifier. The study population consisted of 525,635 singleton live births in Flanders (Belgium) between 1999 and 2009. PM10 exposure at maternal residence was averaged over various time windows. We used robust linear and logistic regression to estimate the effect of PM10 on birth weight and small for gestational age (SGA). Segmented regression models were applied for non-linear associations. Among moderately preterm (32–36 weeks) and term (>36 weeks) births, we found significant lower birth weight for all studied time windows. The estimated reduction in birth weight for a 10µg/m3 increase in average PM10 during pregnancy was 39.0g (95% confidence interval [CI]: 26.4, 51.5g) for moderately preterm births and 24.0g (95% CI: 20.9, 27.2g) for term births. The corresponding odds ratios for SGA were 1.19 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.32) and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.12) respectively. Segmented regression models showed stronger effects of PM10 on fetal growth at lower concentrations. Maternal PM10 exposure was significantly associated with a reduction in fetal growth among term and moderately preterm births, with a tendency of stronger effects for the latter and a flattening out of the slope at higher PM10 concentrations.},

abstract = {In 2012, Chinese Environmental Bureau modified its National Ambient Air Quality Standards to include fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Recent air pollution monitoring data shows that numerous locations have exceeded this standard, which may have resulted in avoidable adverse health effects. For example, among the 74 Chinese cities with PM2.5 monitoring data in 2013, only three cities attained the annual air quality standard (35 $\mu$g/m3). This study aimed to quantify the potential short- and long-term health benefits from achieving the Chinese ambient air quality standard and WHO's air quality objectives. A generalized additive model was used to estimate the short-term association of mortality with changes in daily PM2.5 concentrations, based on which we estimated the potential premature mortality reduction that would have been achieved during the period of 2012–2015 if the daily air quality standard had been met in Guangzhou, China; we also estimated the avoidable deaths if attaining the annual air quality standard using the relative risk obtained from a previous cohort study. During the study period, there were 160 days exceeding the national daily PM2.5 standard (75 $\mu$g/m3) in Guangzhou, and the annual average concentration (47.7 $\mu$g/m3) was higher than the air quality standard of 35 $\mu$g/m3. Significant associations between PM2.5 and mortality were observed. An increase of 10 $\mu$g/m3 in PM2.5 was associated with increases in daily death counts of 0.95% (95% CI: 0.56%, 1.34%) in natural mortality, 1.31% (95% CI: 0.75%, 1.87%) in cardiovascular mortality, and 1.06% (95% CI: 0.19%, 1.94%) in respiratory mortality. The health benefits of attaining the national daily air quality standard of PM2.5 (75 $\mu$g/m3) would have prevented 143 [95% confidence interval (CI): 84, 203] fewer natural deaths, including 84 (95% CI: 48, 121) fewer cardiovascular deaths and 27 (95% CI: 5, 49) fewer respiratory deaths. Had the annual PM2.5 levels been reduced to 35 $\mu$g/m3, an estimated 3875 (95% CI: 1852, 6074) natural deaths, 2378 (95% CI: 800, 4230) cardiovascular deaths, and 227 (95% CI: -437, 1033) respiratory deaths could have been prevented. Even greater substantial mortality reductions could be achieved if the WHO's air quality objectives were met. Our study suggests that air pollution is significantly associated with mortality in Guangzhou, and more stringent air quality standards would significantly reduce air pollution-related premature mortality.},

In each school three classrooms and one outdoor position were monitored from Monday to Friday, in both non-heating (26/09/2011–14/10/2011) and heating (23/01/2012–10/02/2012) period. Temperature, relative humidity and CO2, were continuously monitored. Formaldehyde, benzene, trichloroethylene, pinene, limonene, NO2 and O3 were measured with diffusive samplers. CO was monitored every day (30 min/day). Radon was measured for four weeks with short term radon detectors. PM2.5 was gravimetrically determined while PM2.5 and PM10 fractions were measured using the optical light scattering technique. Building material emission testing for VOCs was performed using the Field and Laboratory Emission Cell (FLEC). The ventilation rate for each classroom was calculated based on the CO2 measurements. Results indicated that indoor air concentrations of the measured pollutants were within accepted limits with indicative ranges 1.5–9.4 $\mu$g/m3 for benzene, 2.3–28.5 $\mu$g/m3 for formaldehyde, 4.6–43 $\mu$g/m3 for NO2 and 0.1–15.6 $\mu$g/m3 for O3. Emissions from building materials seem to have a significant contribution to the indoor air quality. Very low ventilation rates (0.1–3.7 L/s per person) were observed, indicating inadequate ventilation and possible indoor air quality problems requiring intervention measures. The estimated average lifetime cancer risks for benzene, formaldehyde and trichloroethylene were very low.},

abstract = {The problem of environmental health hazards around schools is serious but it has been neglected by researchers and analysts. This is concerning because children are highly susceptible to the effects of chemical hazards. Some ecological studies have demonstrated that higher school-level pollution is associated with lower aggregate school-level standardized test scores likely, related to increased respiratory illnesses and/or impaired cognitive development. However, an important question remains unexamined: How do school-level exposures impact individual children's academic performance? To address this, we obtained socio-demographic and grades data from the parents of 1888 fourth and fifth grade children in the El Paso (Texas, USA) Independent School District in 2012. El Paso is located on the US-side of the Mexican border and has a majority Mexican-origin population. School-based hazardous air pollution (HAP) exposure was calculated using census block-level US Environmental Protection Agency National Air Toxics Assessment risk estimates for respiratory and diesel particulate matter (PM). School-level demographics were obtained from the school district. Multi-level models adjusting for individual-level covariates (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, English proficiency, and economic deprivation) and school-level covariates (e.g., percent of students economically disadvantaged and student-teacher ratio) showed that higher school-level HAPs were associated with lower individual-level grade point averages. An interquartile range increase in school-level HAP exposure was associated with an adjusted 0.11–0.40 point decrease in individual students' grade point averages (GPAs), depending on HAP type and emission source. Respiratory risk from HAPs had a larger effect on GPA than did diesel PM risk. Non-road mobile and total respiratory risk had the largest effects on children's GPA of all HAP variables studied and only mother's level of education had a larger effect than those two variables on children's GPA. The five school-level demographic indicators were only weakly associated with GPA. The study findings indicate the need for regulations on school siting and adjacent land uses to protect children's environmental health.},

Today, air pollution is a global environmental issue, especially in urban environments, emitting particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into the surroundings. The association of exposure to urban air pollution and cognitive disorders in children is a major cause of concern. We review recent findings associated with exposure to air pollutants and explained the potential mechanisms driving oxidative stress in living systems. An attempt has been made to investigate the cognitive effects of air pollutants leading to neurodegeneration, neurodysfunction, attention deficit/hypersensitivity deficiencies and autism in children. Accumulating evidence suggests that urban air pollution may have significant impact on central nervous system (CNS) of the developing brain.},

This study aims to investigate the association of exposure to ambient air pollution during pregnancy with cord blood concentrations of surrogate markers of endothelial dysfunction.
Methods
This population-based cohort was conducted from March 2014 to March 2015 among 250 mother-neonate pairs in urban areas of Isfahan, the second large and air-polluted city in Iran. We analyzed the association between the ambient carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), particular matter 10 (PM10), and air quality index (AQI) with cord blood levels of endothelin-1, vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM), and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM). Multiple regression analysis was conducted after adjustment for potential confounding factors and covariates. The regression coefficient (beta), standard error of the estimate (SE), and 95% confidence intervals for each regression coefficient (95% CI) are reported.
Results
Data of 233 mother-neonate pairs were complete, and included in the analysis. Multiple regression analyses showed that AQI, CO and O3 had significant correlation with cord blood ICAM-1 [Beta (SE), 95%CI: 2.93 (0.72), 1.33,5.54; 2.28(1.44), 1.56,5.12; and 2.02(0.01), 1.03,2.04, respectively] as well as with VCAM-1 [2.78(0.91), 1.69,4.57; 2.47(1.47), 1.43,5.37; and 2.01(0.01),1.07,2.04, respectively]. AQI, PM10, and SO2 were significantly associated with Endothelin-1 concentrations [Beta (SE), 95%CI: 10.16(5.08),7.61,14.28; 9.70(3.46), 2.88,16.52; and 1.07(0.02), 1.03,2.11, respectively].
Conclusions
The significant associations of air pollutants with markers of endothelial dysfunction during fetal period may provide another evidence on the adverse health effects of air pollutants on early stages of atherosclerosis from fetal period. Our findings underscore the importance of considering environmental factors in primordial prevention of chronic diseases.},

abstract = {Background/objectives
Low birth weight (<2500 g) (LBW), premature birth (<37 weeks of gestation) (PB), and late foetal death (<24 h of life) (LFD) are causes of perinatal morbi-mortality, with short- and long-term social and economic health impacts. This study sought to identify gestational windows of susceptibility during pregnancy and to analyse and quantify the impact of different air pollutants, noise and temperature on the adverse birth outcomes.
Methods
Time-series study to assess the impact of mean daily PM2.5, NO2 and O3 ($\mu$g/m3), mean daily diurnal (Leqd) and nocturnal (Leqn) noise levels (dB(A)), maximum and minimum daily temperatures (°C) on the number of births with LBW, PB or LFD in Madrid across the period 2001–2009. We controlled for linear trend, seasonality and autoregression. Poisson regression models were fitted for quantification of the results. The final models were expressed as relative risk (RR) and population attributable risk (PAR).
Results
Leqd was observed to have the following impacts in LBW: at onset of gestation, in the second trimester and in the week of birth itself. NO2 had an impact in the second trimester. In the case of PB, the following: Leqd in the second trimester, Leqn in the week before birth and PM2.5 in the second trimester. In the case of LFD, impacts were observed for both PM2.5 in the third trimester, and minimum temperature. O3 proved significant in the first trimester for LBW and PB, and in the second trimester for LFD.
Conclusions
Pollutants concentrations, noise and temperature influenced the weekly average of new-borns with LBW, PB and LFD in Madrid. Special note should be taken of the effect of diurnal noise on LBW across the entire pregnancy. The exposure of pregnant population to the environmental factors analysed should therefore be controlled with a view to reducing perinatal morbi-mortality.},

abstract = {Risk assessment studies often ignore within-city variations of air pollutants. Our objective was to quantify the risk associated with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure in 2 urban areas using fine-scale air pollution modeling and to characterize how this risk varied according to social deprivation. In Grenoble and Lyon areas (0.4 and 1.2 million inhabitants, respectively) in 2012, PM2.5 exposure was estimated on a 10×10m grid by coupling a dispersion model to population density. Outcomes were mortality, lung cancer and term low birth weight incidences. Cases attributable to air pollution were estimated overall and stratifying areas according to the European Deprivation Index (EDI), taking 10µg/m3 yearly average as reference (counterfactual) level. Estimations were repeated assuming spatial homogeneity of air pollutants within urban area. Median PM2.5 levels were 18.1 and 19.6$\mu$g/m3 in Grenoble and Lyon urban areas, respectively, corresponding to 114 (5.1% of total, 95% confidence interval, CI, 3.2–7.0%) and 491 non-accidental deaths (6.0% of total, 95% CI 3.7–8.3%) attributable to long-term exposure to PM2.5, respectively. Attributable term low birth weight cases represented 23.6% of total cases (9.0–37.1%) in Grenoble and 27.6% of cases (10.7–42.6%) in Lyon. In Grenoble, 6.8% of incident lung cancer cases were attributable to air pollution (95% CI 3.1–10.1%). Risk was lower by 8 to 20% when estimating exposure through background stations. Risk was highest in neighborhoods with intermediate to higher social deprivation. Risk assessment studies relying on background stations to estimate air pollution levels may underestimate the attributable risk.},

No studies have yet examined the associations between PM2.5 components and hospital admissions among a privately insured population. We estimated the short-term associations between exposure to PM2.5 mass and components and emergency hospital admissions for all-cause and cause-specific diseases in Greater Houston, Texas, during 2008–2013 using Blue Cross Blue Shield Texas claims data. A total of 90,085 emergency hospital admissions were included in this study, with an average of 34 ± 10 admissions per day. We selected 20 PM2.5 components from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Chemical Speciation Network site located in Houston, and then applied Poisson regression models to assess the short-term effects of PM2.5 mass and species on emergency hospital admissions. Effects were estimated without adjustment for other airborne pollutants. PM2.5 mass was not statistically significantly associated with increased all-cause emergency hospital admissions and selected cause-specific admissions. For selected PM2.5 species, we found interquartile range increases in arsenic (0.001 $\mu$g/m3) and copper (0.017 $\mu$g/m3) were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with increased admissions for stroke, (5.98% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73, 11.50%]) and pneumonia (4.07% [95% CI: 0.37, 7.90%]), respectively. Seasonal analysis showed weak variation among PM2.5 mass and components, except that nickel significantly increased all-cause emergency hospital admissions (2.16% [95% CI: 0.21, 4.14%]) during the warm season. Our findings suggest that hospital admissions in the privately insured population are slightly affected by ambient fine particulate matter air pollution.},

abstract = {We developed regionalized characterization factors (CFs) for human health damage from particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone, and for damage to vegetation from ozone, at the global scale. These factors can be used in the impact assessment phase of an environmental life cycle assessment. CFs express the overall damage of a certain pollutant per unit of emission of a precursor, i.e. primary PM2.5, nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). The global chemical transport model TM5 was used to calculate intake fractions of PM2.5 and ozone for 56 world regions covering the whole globe. Furthermore, region-specific effect and damage factors were derived, using mortality rates, background concentrations and years of life lost. The emission-weighted world average CF for primary PM2.5 emissions is 629 yr kton−1, varying up to 3 orders of magnitude over the regions. Larger CFs were obtained for emissions in central Asia and Europe, and smaller factors in Australia and South America. The world average CFs for PM2.5 from secondary aerosols, i.e. NOx, NH3, and SO2, is 67.2 to 183.4 yr kton−1. We found that the CFs for ozone human health damage are 2–4 orders of magnitude lower compared to the CFs for damage due to primary PM2.5 and PM2.5 precursor emissions. Human health damage due to the priority air pollutants considered in this study was 1.7{\textperiodcentered}10−2 yr capita−1 worldwide in year 2010, with primary PM2.5 emissions as the main contributor (62%). The emission-weighted world average CF for ecosystem damage due to ozone was 2.5 km2 yr kton−1 for NMVOCs and 8.7 m2 yr kg−1 for NOx emissions, varying 2–3 orders of magnitude over the regions. Ecosystem damage due to the priority air pollutants considered in this study was 1.6{\textperiodcentered}10−4 km2 capita−1 worldwide in 2010, with NOx as the main contributor (72%). The spatial range in CFs stresses the importance of including spatial variation in life cycle impact assessment of priority air pollutants.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to air pollution has been associated with cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality. However, the chemical constituents and pollution sources underlying these associations remain unclear.
Method
We conducted a cohort panel study involving 97 elderly subjects living in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Airway and circulating biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation were measured weekly over 12 weeks and included, exhaled breath condensate malondialdehyde (EBC MDA), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), plasma oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), and plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6). Exposures included 7-day personal nitrogen oxides (NOx), daily criteria-pollutant data, five-day average particulate matter (PM) measured in three size-fractions and characterized by chemical components including transition metals, and in vitro PM oxidative potential (dithiothreitol and macrophage reactive oxygen species). Associations between biomarkers and pollutants were assessed using linear mixed effects regression models.
Results
We found significant positive associations of airway oxidative stress and inflammation with traffic-related air pollutants, ultrafine particles and transition metals. Positive but nonsignificant associations were observed with PM oxidative potential. The strongest associations were observed among PM variables in the ultrafine range (PM <0.18µm). It was estimated that an interquartile increase in 5-day average ultrafine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was associated with a 6.3% (95% CI: 1.1%, 11.6%) increase in EBC MDA and 6.7% (95% CI: 3.4%, 10.2%) increase in FeNO. In addition, positive but nonsignificant associations were observed between oxLDL and traffic-related pollutants, ultrafine particles and transition metals while plasma IL-6 was positively associated with 1-day average traffic-related pollutants.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that exposure to pollutants with high oxidative potential (traffic-related pollutants, ultrafine particles, and transition metals) may lead to increased airway oxidative stress and inflammation in elderly adults. This observation was less clear with circulating biomarkers.},

The aim of the present study is to examine the relationship between air pollutants and lung function in children selected from heavily industrialized and polluted cities in northeastern China. During 2012, 6740 boys and girls aged 7–14 years were recruited in 24 districts of seven northeastern cities. Portable electronic spirometers were used to measure lung function. Four-year average concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) were measured at monitoring stations in the 24 districts. Two-staged regression models were used in the data analysis, controlling for covariates. Overall, for all subjects, the increased odds of lung function impairment associated with exposure to air pollutants, ranged from 5% (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01, 1.10) for FVC < 85% predicted per 46.3 $\mu$g/m3 for O3 to 81% (aOR = 1.81; 95%CI = 1.44, 2.28) for FEV1 < 85% predicted per 30.6 $\mu$g/m3 for PM10. The linear regression models consistently showed a negative relationship between all air pollutants and lung function measures across subjects. There were significant interaction terms indicating gender differences for lung function impairment and pulmonary function from exposure to some pollutants (P < 0.10). In conclusion, long term exposure to high concentrations of ambient air pollution is associated with decreased pulmonary function and lung function impairment, and females appear to be more susceptible than males.},

Effects of the pollutants (Relative Risk (RR) on current-day (lag 0) mortality to the first ten days (lag 10) were determined. Data on daily mortality, daily mean concentrations of air pollutants of PM10, SO2 and NO2 and daily mean concentrations of temperature and humidity for İstanbul were used in the study. We found significant associations between air pollution and daily mortality from cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, and total non-accidental causes in İstanbul. An increase of 10 $\mu$g/m3 in concentrations of PM10, SO2 and NO2 over 10 days of lag corresponds to RR = 1.0222 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.9957–1.0494), RR = 1.1639 (95% CI = 1.0279–1.3177) and RR = 1.0327 (95% CI = 1.0105–1.0554) increase of cardiovascular mortality, respectively. The associations for total non-accidental and respiratory mortality were also positive. Among the three air pollutants, SO2 was associated with the largest RR for deaths from cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and total mortality. In conclusion, our study showed that short-term exposure to air pollution was associated with increased cardiovascular, respiratory and total non-accidental mortality in the city during 2007–2012. These findings may have implications for local environmental and social policies.},

abstract = {With the development of society and the economy, many Chinese cities are shrouded in pollution haze for much of the year. Scientific studies have identified various adverse effects of air pollutants on human beings. However, the relationships between air pollution and blood lipid levels are still unclear. The objective of this study is to explore the short and long-term effects of air pollution on eight blood lipid markers among elderly hypertension inpatients complicated with or without type 2 diabetes (T2D). Blood lipid markers which met the pre-established inclusion criteria were exported from the medical record system. Air pollution data were acquired from the official environmental protection website. Associations between the air quality index and the blood lipid indexes were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and further Bonferroni correction. In an exposure time of 7 days or longer, blood lipid markers were somewhat affected by poor air quality. However, the results could not predict whether atherosclerosis would be promoted or inhibited by poorer air condition. Changes of blood lipid markers of hypertension inpatients with or without T2D were not completely the same, but no blood lipid markers had an opposite trend between the two populations. The air quality index was associated with changes to blood lipid markers to some extent in a population of hypertension inpatients with or without T2D. Further studies are needed to investigate the potential mechanism by which air pollutants induce blood lipids changes.},

Evidence linking long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution with allergic rhinitis (AR) in children is scare, and the role of components of air pollution and timing of exposure remains unclear.
Objective
To assess the association of pre- and post-natal exposure to air pollution with life-time prevalence of AR in preschool children.
Methods
We conducted a cohort study of 2598 children aged 3–6 years in Changsha, China. The lifetime prevalence of AR was assessed by a questionnaire administered by parents. Children's exposures to dioxide nitrogen (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 $\mu$m (PM10) during different pre- and post-natal timing windows were estimated using the measured concentrations at monitoring stations. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of childhood AR for exposure to different air pollutants during different timing windows were assessed by logistic regression model in terms of an interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure level.
Results
Life-time prevalence of AR in preschool children (7.3%) was associated with both pre- and post-natal exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP), but only significant during the third trimester of pregnancy with adjusted OR = 1.40 (95% CI: 1.08–1.82) for a 15 $\mu$g/m3 increase in NO2 and during the first-year of life with adjusted OR = 1.36 (95% CI: 1.03–1.78) and 1.54 (95% CI: 1.07–2.21) respectively for 11 and 12 $\mu$g/m3 increase in NO2 and PM10. The association of early life exposure to TRAP with childhood AR was robust by adjusting for other air pollutants and timing windows. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the association was higher in the children who are male, young, with genetic predisposition by parental atopy, and living in damp houses.
Conclusion
Early life exposure to traffic-related air pollutant during pregnancy and first-year of life may contribute to childhood AR.},

Fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5) is known to contribute to cardiorespiratory mortality but it is not clear how PM2.5 oxidative burden (i.e. the ability of PM2.5 to cause oxidative stress) may influence long-term mortality risk.
Methods
We examined the relationship between PM2.5 oxidative burden and cause-specific mortality in Ontario, Canada. Integrated PM2.5 samples were collected from 30 provincial monitoring sites between 2012 and 2013. The oxidative potential (% depletion/µg) of regional PM2.5 was measured as the ability of filter extracts to deplete antioxidants (glutathione and ascorbate) in a synthetic respiratory tract lining fluid. PM2.5 oxidative burden was calculated as the product of PM2.5 mass concentrations and regional estimates of oxidative potential. In total, this study included 193,300 people who completed the Canadian long-form census in 1991 and who lived within 5km of a site where oxidative potential was measured. Deaths occurring between 1991 and 2009 were identified through record linkages and Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) for interquartile changes in exposure adjusting for individual-level covariates and indirect-adjustment for smoking and obesity.
Results
Glutathione-related oxidative burden was associated with cause-specific mortality. For lung cancer specifically, this metric was associated with a 12% (95% CI: 5.0–19) increased risk of mortality whereas a 5.0% (95% CI: 0.1, 10) increase was observed for PM2.5. Indirect adjustment for smoking and obesity decreased the lung cancer hazard ratio for glutathione-related oxidative burden but it remained significantly elevated (HR=1.07, 95% CI: 1.005, 1.146). Ascorbate-related oxidative burden was not associated with mortality.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that glutathione-related oxidative burden may be more strongly associated with lung cancer mortality than PM2.5 mass concentrations.},

abstract = {Background
Mounting evidence suggests that exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with the development of childhood allergic diseases, but the effect of prenatal exposure to air pollution on the risk of childhood asthma and allergy is unclear.
Objectives
We evaluated the association between maternal exposure to outdoor air pollution during different trimesters of pregnancy and incidence of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema in 2598 preschool children aged 3–6 years in China.
Methods
Children's lifetime incidence of allergic diseases was obtained using questionnaire. Individual exposure to outdoor air pollutants during trimesters of pregnancy was estimated by an inverse distance weighted (IDW) method based on the measured concentrations at monitoring stations. We used multiple logistic regression method to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema for per interquartile range (IQR) increase in the exposure to air pollutant in each trimester, which was adjusted for the effect of other air pollutants and its effect in other trimesters by a multi-pollutant/trimester model.
Results
Incidence of asthma (6.8%), allergic rhinitis (7.3%), and eczema (28.6%) in children was associated with maternal exposure to traffic-related pollutant NO2 during entire pregnancy with OR (95% confidence interval [CI]) respectively 1.63 (0.99–2.70), 1.69 (1.03–2.77), and 1.37 (1.04–1.80). After adjustment for other pollutants and trimesters, we found the association was significant only in specific trimester: the first trimester for eczema (1.54, 1.14–2.09), the second trimester for asthma (1.72, 1.02–2.97), and the third trimester for allergic rhinitis (1.77, 1.09–2.89). Sensitivity analysis indicated that the trimester sensitive to the development of allergic diseases was stable.
Conclusion
Maternal exposure to traffic-related air pollutant NO2 during pregnancy, especially in specific trimesters, is associated with an increased risk of developing asthma, rhinitis, and eczema in children. Our results support the hypothesis that childhood allergic diseases originate in fetal life and are triggered by traffic-related air pollution in sensitive trimesters.},

abstract = {Background
Although the health effects of long term exposure to air pollution are well established, it is difficult to effectively communicate the health risks of this (largely invisible) risk factor to the public and policy makers. The purpose of this study is to develop a method that expresses the health effects of air pollution in an equivalent number of daily passively smoked cigarettes.
Methods
Defined changes in PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and Black Carbon (BC) concentration were expressed into number of passively smoked cigarettes, based on equivalent health risks for four outcome measures: Low Birth Weight (<2500g at term), decreased lung function (FEV1), cardiovascular mortality and lung cancer. To describe the strength of the relationship with ETS and air pollutants, we summarized the epidemiological literature using published or new meta-analyses.
Results
Realistic increments of 10µg/m3 in PM2.5 and NO2 concentration and a 1µg/m3 increment in BC concentration correspond to on average (standard error in parentheses) 5.5 (1.6), 2.5 (0.6) and 4.0 (1.2) passively smoked cigarettes per day across the four health endpoints, respectively. The uncertainty reflects differences in equivalence between the health endpoints and uncertainty in the concentration response functions. The health risk of living along a major freeway in Amsterdam is, compared to a counterfactual situation with ‘clean' air, equivalent to 10 daily passively smoked cigarettes..
Conclusions
We developed a method that expresses the health risks of air pollution and the health benefits of better air quality in a simple, appealing manner. The method can be used both at the national/regional and the local level. Evaluation of the usefulness of the method as a communication tool is needed.},

We used national real-time syndromic surveillance systems, including general practitioner (GP) consultations, emergency department attendances, telehealth calls and ambulance dispatch calls to further understand the impact of these short term acute air pollution periods on the health seeking behaviour of the general public. Each air pollution period was comparable with respect to particulate matter concentrations (PM10 and PM2.5), however, the second period was longer in duration (6 days vs 3 days) and meteorologically driven ‘Sahara dust' contributed to the pollution. Health surveillance data revealed a greater impact during the second period, with GP consultations, emergency department attendances and telehealth (NHS 111) calls increasing for asthma, wheeze and difficulty breathing indicators, particularly in patients aged 15–64 years. Across regions of England there was good agreement between air quality levels and health care seeking behaviour. The results further demonstrate the acute impact of short term air pollution episodes on public health and also illustrate the potential role of mass media reporting in escalating health care seeking behaviour.},

Furthermore, we genotyped functional polymorphisms in genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines, namely rs1800629 in TNF$\alpha$ (tumor necrosis factor alpha) and rs16944 in IL1B (interleukin-1$\beta$). In logistic regression models, long-term exposure to NO2 increased PD risk overall (odds ratio (OR)=1.06 per 2.94$\mu$g/m3 increase, 95% CI=1.00–1.13). The OR for PD in individuals with high NO2 exposure (≧75th percentile) and the AA genotype of IL1B rs16944 was 3.10 (95% CI=1.14–8.38) compared with individuals with lower NO2 exposure (<75th percentile) and the GG genotype. The interaction term was nominally significant on the multiplicative scale (p=0.01). We did not find significant gene-environment interactions with TNF rs1800629. Our finds may provide suggestive evidence that a combination of traffic-related air pollution and genetic variation in the proinflammatory cytokine gene IL1B contribute to risk of developing PD. However, as statistical evidence was only modest in this large sample we cannot rule out that these results represent a chance finding, and additional replication efforts are warranted.},

abstract = {Introduction
Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions from vegetation fires can be transported over long distances and may cause significant air pollution episodes far from the fires. However, epidemiological evidence on health effects of vegetation-fire originated air pollution is limited, particularly for mortality and cardiovascular outcomes.
Objective
We examined association between short-term exposure to long-range transported PM2.5 from vegetation fires and daily mortality due to non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory causes and daily hospital admissions due to cardiovascular and respiratory causes in the Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland.
Methods
Days significantly affected by smoke from vegetation fires between 2001 and 2010 were identified using air quality measurements at an urban background and a regional background monitoring station, and modelled data on surface concentrations of vegetation-fire smoke. Associations between daily PM2.5 concentration and health outcomes on i) smoke-affected days and ii) all other days (i.e. non-smoke days) were analysed using Poisson time series regression. All statistical models were adjusted for daily temperature and relative humidity, influenza, pollen, and public holidays.
Results
On smoke-affected days, 10µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a borderline statistically significant increase in cardiovascular mortality among total population at a lag of three days (12.4%, 95% CI −0.2% to 26.5%), and among the elderly (≥65 years) following same-day exposure (13.8%, 95% CI −0.6% to 30.4%) and at a lag of three days (11.8%, 95% CI −2.2% to 27.7%). Smoke day PM2.5 was not associated with non-accidental mortality or hospital admissions due to cardiovascular causes. However, there was an indication of a positive association with hospital admissions due to respiratory causes among the elderly, and admissions due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma among the total population. In contrast, on non-smoke days PM2.5 was generally not associated with the health outcomes, apart from suggestive small positive effects on non-accidental mortality at a lag of one day among the elderly and hospital admissions due to all respiratory causes following same-day exposure among the total population.
Conclusions
Our research provides suggestive evidence for an association of exposure to long-range transported PM2.5 from vegetation fires with increased cardiovascular mortality, and to a lesser extent with increased hospital admissions due to respiratory causes. Hence, vegetation-fire originated air pollution may have adverse effects on public health over a distance of hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the fires.},

abstract = {Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, characterized by recurrent relapses of inflammation that cause mild to severe disability. Exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) has been associated with acute increases in systemic inflammatory responses and neuroinflammation. In the present study, we hypothesize that exposure to PM<10$\mu$m in diameter (PM10) might increase the occurrence of MS-related hospitalizations.
Methods
We obtained daily concentrations of PM10 from 53 monitoring sites covering the study area and we identified 8287 MS-related hospitalization through hospital admission-discharge records of the Lombardy region, Italy, between 2001 and 2009. We used a Poisson regression analysis to investigate the association between exposure to PM10 and risk of hospitalization.
Results
A higher RR of hospital admission for MS relapse was associated with exposure to PM10 at different time intervals. The maximum effect of PM10 on MS hospitalization was found for exposure between days 0 and 7: Hospital admission for MS increased 42% (95%CI 1.39–1.45) on the days preceded by one week with PM10 levels in the highest quartile. The p-value for trend across quartiles was<0.001.
Conclusions
These data support the hypothesis that air pollution may have a role in determining MS occurrence and relapses. Our findings could open new avenues for determining the pathogenic mechanisms of MS and potentially be applied to other autoimmune diseases.},

abstract = {Background
The Lombardy region in northern Italy ranks among the most air polluted areas of Europe. Previous studies showed air pollution short-term effects on all-cause mortality. We examine here the effects of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10µm (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure on deaths and hospitalizations from specific causes, including cardiac, cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases.
Methods
We considered air pollution, mortality and hospitalization data for a non-opportunistic sample of 18 highly polluted and most densely populated areas of the region in the years 2003–2006. We obtained area-specific effect estimates for PM10 and NO2 from a Poisson regression model on the daily number of total deaths or cause-specific hospitalizations and then combined them in a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis. For cause-specific mortality, we applied a case-crossover analysis. Age- and season-specific analyses were also performed. Effect estimates were expressed as percent variation in mortality or hospitalizations associated with a 10µg/m3 increase in PM10 or NO2 concentration.
Results
Natural mortality was positively associated with both pollutants (0.30%, 90% Credibility Interval [CrI]: −0.31; 0.78 for PM10; 0.70%, 90%CrI: 0.10; 1.27 for NO2). Cardiovascular deaths showed a higher percent variation in association with NO2 (1.12%, 90% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.14; 2.11), while the percent variation for respiratory mortality was highest in association with PM10 (1.64%, 90%CI: 0.35; 2.93). The effect of both pollutants was more evident in the summer season. Air pollution was also associated to hospitalizations, the highest variations being 0.77% (90%CrI: 0.22; 1.43) for PM10 and respiratory diseases, and 1.70% (90%CrI: 0.39; 2.84) for NO2 and cerebrovascular diseases. The effect of PM10 on respiratory hospital admissions appeared to increase with age. For both pollutants, effects on cerebrovascular hospitalizations were more evident in subjects aged less than 75 years.
Conclusions
Our study provided a sound characterization of air pollution exposure and its potential effects on human health in the most polluted, and also most populated and productive, Italian region, further documenting the need for effective public health policies.},

abstract = {Background
U.S. urban air quality has improved dramatically over the past decades. We evaluated acute effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on cardiovascular (CVD) mortality among residents of Allegheny County in SW Pennsylvania (1999–2011) using spatio-temporal modeling of air pollutants (AP) to reduce misclassification error in exposure assessment.
Methods
Spatio-temporal kriging of daily PM2.5 and ozone (O3) was used to produce daily exposure estimates at the residence ZIP code. Time-stratified case-crossover analysis was conducted to examine short-term effects of PM2.5 on CVD mortality, adjusting for O3 and apparent mean temperature. We studied both single and distributed lags for days 0–5. All CVD mortality and subcategories of ischemic heart disease (IHD), acute myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia were examined.
Results
A total of 62,135 deaths were identified. We found significant associations of PM2.5 with IHD and PVD mortality at lag day 5: (2.1% (95% CI, 0.2–4.1%) and (7.6%, 95% CI, 0.05–15.7%) per 10µg/m3 increase of PM2.5 in single lag models and for IHD in distributed lag models. There were no statistically significant associations with PM2.5 for any of the other outcomes.
Conclusions
The application of finer scale geographically resolved AP exposures made it possible to study acute effects of PM2.5 on CVD mortality in a large metropolitan area. Our study results demonstrated the continued presence of a dose response relationship of increased risk of CVD mortality within this lower range of PM2.5 exposure.},

abstract = {Objectives
The olfactory nerve is anatomically susceptible to injury from pollution in inspired air, but there are no large-scale epidemiologic studies investigating this relationship.
Methods
Cross-sectional study using data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, a representative sample of home-dwelling US adults age 57–85 years. Olfactory function was tested using a validated 5-item odor identification test (Sniffin' Sticks). Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at each respondent's home was estimated as 1–12 month moving averages prior to olfactory assessment using validated spatio-temporal models.
Results
Olfactory dysfunction was significantly associated with PM2.5 exposures averaged over 3–12 months in urban-dwelling respondents. The strongest effect was for 6 month average exposure (per 1-IQR increase in PM2.5: OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.05, 1.55) adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, cognition, comorbidity, smoking, and the season. Interestingly, the most deleterious effects were observed among the youngest respondents, 57–64 years old, and those living in the northeast and south.
Conclusions
We show for the first time that air pollution exposure is associated with poor olfaction among urban-living, older US adults.},

abstract = {Objective
To estimate the degree to which fine particulate (PM2.5) air pollution is associated with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs).
Methods
We used population-based administrative data from Alberta (1993–2007) and Quebec (1989–2011). SARD algorithms included ≥2 physician billing codes, or ≥1 rheumatology billing code, or ≥1 hospitalization diagnostic code (for systemic lupus, Sjogren's Syndrome, scleroderma, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, or undifferentiated connective tissue disease). Bayesian hierarchical latent class regression models estimated the probability that any given resident was a SARD case, based on the algorithms. Mean 2001–2006 residential ambient PM2.5 levels were assigned using satellite-derived data for dissemination area regions in Alberta and CLSC regions in Quebec. The sum of individual level probabilities provided the estimated total cases per region in each province, according to age, sex, urban-versus-rural residence, income, and PM2.5 levels. In Alberta, we ran separate models for First-Nations (FN) and non-First Nations subgroups. Bayesian logistic regression modeling generated odds ratio (OR) estimates for being a SARD case, accounting concurrently for demographics, as well as an interaction term between age and sex.
Results
Our data suggested that the probability of being a SARD case was higher among females versus males and for residents aged >45 versus younger, with the highest ORs for older females. Independently, the odds of being a SARDs case increased with PM2.5 levels in both provinces.
Conclusion
Our data suggest that PM2.5 exposure may be associated with an increased risk of SARDs.},

In this study the effect of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and O3 pollutants on human health among the inhabitants of Mashhad has been evaluated. To evaluate the health effects due to air pollution, the AirQ model software 3.3.2, developed by WHO European Centre for Environment and Health, was used. The daily data related to the pollutants listed above has been used for the short term health effects (total mortality, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, hospitalization due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute myocardial infarction). PM2.5 had the most health effects on Mashhad inhabitants. With increasing in each 10$\mu$g/m3, relative risk rate of pollutant concentration for total mortality due to PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2 and O3 was increased of 0.6%, 1.5%, 0.4%, 0.3% and 0.46% respectively and, the attributable proportion of total mortality attributed to these pollutants was respectively equal to 4.24%, 4.57%, 0.99%, 2.21%, 2.08%, and 1.61% (CI 95%) of the total mortality (correct for the non-accident) occurred in the year of study. The results of this study have a good compatibly with other studies conducted on the effects of air pollution on humans. The AirQ software model can be used in decision-makings as a useful and easy tool.},

abstract = {Over the past few decades, multiple low level indoor pollutants have been found in domestic dwellings. The types and concentrations of these indoor pollutants have not been consistent over time and have changed with alterations in lifestyle, the development of novel products used in housing, and the development of new measurement technologies. To clarify the highest risk pollutants for which health risks should be reduced, we conducted a health risk assessment of 49 indoor air pollutants measured in 602 houses during winter and summer from 2012 to 2014. Inhalation reference concentrations were determined, and the margins of exposure were estimated for each indoor pollutant from measured indoor air concentrations. Health risks due to ammonia and acidic gases, including formic acid, acetic acid, and hydrogen chloride, were also assessed. Overall, during both winter and summer, the highest risk pollutants were acrolein, nitrogen dioxide, benzene, formic acid, and hydrogen chloride. The health risks of propanal, acetaldehyde, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene were also high. Principal component analysis (PCA) suggested an independent principal component for 1,4-dichlorobenzene. The primary source of exposure to 1,4-dichlorobenzene in Japan is an indoor household insect repellent. The improvement of individual lifestyle and housing may be appropriate targets for reducing the risk associated with this compound. The provision of further information on the risk to consumers and promotion of changes in consumer consciousness are needed. PCA suggested that the health risks of indoor air pollutants are amalgamated into similar chemical families, such as aldehydes, aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, or acetic esters. Our results suggest that health-based guidelines or source control measures, based on these chemical families and similar health endpoints, are appropriate for reducing total health risk due to multiple low level indoor pollutants.},

abstract = {Background
Almost half the world's population is exposed to household air pollution from biomass and coal combustion. The acute effects of household air pollution on the cardiovascular system are poorly characterized. We conducted a panel study of rural Indian women to assess whether personal exposures to black carbon during cooking were associated with acute changes in blood pressure.
Methods
We enrolled 45 women (ages 25–66 years) who cooked with biomass fuels. During cooking sessions in winter and summer, we simultaneously measured their personal real-time exposure to black carbon and conducted ambulatory blood pressure measurements every 10min. We recorded ambient temperature and participants' activities while cooking. We assessed body mass index, socioeconomic status, and salt intake. Multivariate mixed effects regression models with random intercepts were used to estimate the associations between blood pressure and black carbon exposure, e.g., average exposure in the minutes preceding blood pressure measurement, and average exposure over an entire cooking session.
Results
Women's geometric mean (GM) exposure to black carbon during cooking sessions was lower in winter (GM: 40$\mu$g/m3; 95% CI: 30, 53) than in summer (GM: 56$\mu$g/m3; 95% CI: 42, 76). Interquartile range increases in black carbon were associated with changes in systolic blood pressure from −0.4mm Hg (95% CI: −2.3, 1.5) to 1.9mm Hg (95% CI: −0.8, 4.7), with associations increasing in magnitude as black carbon values were assessed over greater time periods preceding blood pressure measurement. Interquartile range increases in black carbon were associated with small decreases in diastolic blood pressure from −0.9mm Hg (95% CI: −1.7, −0.1) to −0.4mm Hg (95% CI: −1.6, 0.8). Associations of a similar magnitude were estimated for cooking session-averaged values.
Conclusions
We found some evidence of an association between exposure to black carbon and acute increases in systolic blood pressure in Indian women cooking with biomass fuels, which may have implications for the development of cardiovascular diseases.},

abstract = {Background
Many young children in the U.S. spend a significant portion of their day in child care facilities where they may be exposed to contaminants linked to adverse health effects. Exposure data on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM) in these settings is scarce.
Objective
To guide the design of a larger exposure assessment study in urban child care facilities, we conducted a pilot study in which we characterized indoor concentrations of select VOCs and PM.
Methods
We recruited 14 child care facilities in the District of Columbia (Washington, DC) and measured indoor concentrations of seven VOCs (n=35 total samples; 2–5 samples per facility): benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, ethylbenzene, o-xylene, p-xylene, and toluene in all facilities; and collected real-time PM measurements in seven facilities. We calculated descriptive statistics for contaminant concentrations and computed intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to evaluate the variability of VOC levels indoors. We also administered a survey to collect general health information on the children attending these facilities, and information on general housekeeping practices and proximity of facilities to potential sources of target contaminants.
Results
We detected six of the seven VOCs in the majority of child care facilities with detection frequencies ranging from 71% to 100%. Chloroform and toluene were detected in all samples. Median (range) concentrations for toluene, chloroform, benzene, o-xylene, ethylbenzene, and carbon tetrachloride were: 5.6µg/m3 (0.6–16.5µg/m3), 2.8µg/m3 (0.4–53.0µg/m3), 1.4µg/m3 (below the limit of detection or <LOD – 4.4µg/m3), 1.1µg/m3 (<LOD – 35.7µg/m3), 1.0µg/m3 (<LOD – 28.5µg/m3), and 1.0µg/m3 (<LOD – 1.6µg/m3), respectively. The ICCs for the VOCs measured ranged from 0.32 to 0.75. Child care facility median concentrations for PM2.5 and PM10 were 20.1µg/m3 and 26.3µg/m3, respectively. Chlorine bleach, a source of chloroform, was used in almost all facilities, air fresheners and/or scented candles were used in half of the facilities, and at least one child in each facility had physician-diagnosed asthma (median asthma prevalence rate=10.2%).
Conclusion
We found quantifiable levels of VOCs and PM in the child care facilities sampled. Given that exposures to environmental contaminants during critical developmental stages may have long lasting impacts on children's health, larger studies are needed to characterize and identify sources of exposures to these and other indoor contaminants to develop exposure mitigation strategies.},

We aimed to determine an association of indoor air pollution from coal combustion (IAPCC) and lifestyle with ILI risk in housewives, and the modification effect of phase II metabolic enzyme genes. We recruited 403 housewives for a cross-sectional study in Shanxi Province, China, including 135 with ILI frequency (≥1 time per year in the past ten years) as the case group and 268 with ILI frequency (<1 times per year) as the control group. Information on their energy usage characteristics and lifestyle was collected by questionnaires, as well as the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of epoxide hydrolase 1 (rs1051740 and rs2234922), N-acetyltransferase 2 (rs1041983), and glutathione S-transferase (rs1695). We used exposure index to indicate the level of IAPCC among housewives. Our results revealed that the exposure index was positively correlated with ILI frequency. A significant dose-response trend between the exposure index and ILI risk was found with or without adjusting for confounders. Cooking frequency in kitchen with coal as primary fuel and ventilation frequency in the living room or bedroom with a coal-fueled stove for heating during the heating season were two important risk factors to affect ILI frequency. Only rs1051740 was found to be associated with exposure index, whereas it didn't have interaction effect with exposure index on ILI frequency. In conclusion, IAPCC and SNPs of rs1051740 were both associated with ILI frequency.},

This study estimated the excess risks (ER) of CVD and RD mortalities associated with prolonged continuous exposure to high PM2.5 pollution for the whole population and specific subsociodemographic groups in Beijing, which is the capital city of China with over 20 million residents and having severe PM2.5 pollution problems. Our results suggested that when high PM2.5 pollution occurred continuously, at various thresholds and durations, the adverse effects on CVD and RD mortalities varied significantly. The CVD mortality risks in association with prolonged continuous high PM2.5 pollution exposure were more serious for single individuals (including unmarried, divorced, and widowed), illiterate and outdoor workers than for other specific subsociodemographic groups. When the daily PM2.5 concentration higher than 105 $\mu$g/m3 consecutively occurs, at the ninth day, the ERs of CVD death for single individuals, illiterate and outdoor workers groups reached to 45% (95% CI: 22, 71), 51% (95% CI: 28, 79) and 53% (95% CI: 29, 82) respectively. On the other hand, prolonged continuous high PM2.5 pollution level appeared to contribute a higher proportion of RD deaths among illiterate and outdoor workers, but less significant for the other specific subsociodemographic groups. When the duration with daily PM2.5 pollution higher than 115 $\mu$g/m3 reached to six days, the ERs for outdoor workers and illiterate attributed to prolonged continuous PM2.5 pollution exposure increased 36% (95% CI: 5, 76) and 49% (95% CI: 16, 91) respectively.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to multiple types of air pollution may contribute to and exacerbate allergic diseases including asthma and wheezing. However, few studies have examined chronic air pollution exposure and allergic disease outcomes among an adult population. Associations between potential estimates of annual average fine particulate matter (PM2.5), traffic related air pollution, and industrial source air emissions and three allergic disease outcomes (asthma, allergies and wheezing) were examined in a state-wide general population of adults.
Methods
The study includes a representative sample of 3381 adult Wisconsin residents who participated in the 2008–2013 Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) program. Participant data were geographically linked to The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Baysian space-time downscaler air pollution model for PM2.5, the United States Census roadway, and USEPA's Toxic Release Inventory data. Self-report and lung function (FEV1) estimates were used to define prevalence of asthma, allergies and wheezing symptoms.
Results
Annual mean exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was between 6.59 and 15.14$\mu$g/m3. An increase of 5$\mu$g/m3 in the annual mean PM2.5 resulted in a 3.58 (2.36, 5.43) increase in the adjusted odds (95% CI) of having asthma. Exposure to vehicle traffic increased the odds of both current allergies [OR (95% CI)=1.35 (1.07, 1.35)] and current asthma [OR (95% CI)=1.51 (1.14, 2.00)]. Living within 300m of an Interstate roadway was associated with a 3-fold increase in the odds of asthma. Those living within 800m of an industrial site were 47% more likely to have asthma. No significant associations were seen with wheezing.
Conclusions
Within this population exposed to overall annual average levels of estimated low level chronic exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at or near 12$\mu$g/m3, the USEPA standard for air quality, significant association between both modeled PM2.5 exposure and proximity to roadways with asthma and allergies but not wheezing were found. Industrial source emissions were not associated with any allergic disease outcomes.},

abstract = {Cancer can be caused by exposure to air pollution released by industrial facilities. The European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) has made it possible to study exposure to industrial pollution. This study seeks to describe the industrial emissions in the vicinity of Spanish towns and their temporal changes, and review our experience studying industrial pollution and cancer. Data on industrial pollutant sources (2007–2010) were obtained from the E-PRTR registries. Population exposure was estimated by the distance from towns to industrial facilities. We calculated the amount of carcinogens emitted into the air in the proximity (<5km) of towns and show them in municipal maps. We summarized the most relevant results and conclusions reported by ecological E-PRTR-based on studies of cancer mortality and industrial pollution in Spain and the limitations and result interpretations of these types of studies. There are high amounts of carcinogen emissions in the proximity of towns in the southwest, east and north of the country and the total amount of emitted carcinogens is considerable (e.g. 20Mt of arsenic, 63Mt of chromium and 9Mt of cadmium). Although the emissions of some carcinogens in the proximity of certain towns were reduced during the study period, emissions of benzene, dioxins+furans and polychlorinated biphenyls rose. Moreover, the average population of towns lying within a 5km radius from emission sources of carcinogens included in the International Agency for Research on Cancer list of carcinogens was 9 million persons. On the other hand, the results of the reviewed studies suggest that those Spanish regions exposed to the pollution released by certain types of industrial facilities have around 17% cancer excess mortality when compared with those unexposed. Moreover, excess mortality is focused on digestive and respiratory tract cancers, leukemias, prostate, breast and ovarian cancers. Despite their limitations, ecological studies are a useful tool in environmental epidemiology, not only for proposing etiological hypotheses about the risk of living close to industrial pollutant sources, but also for providing data to account for situations of higher mortality in specific areas. Nevertheless, the reduction of emissions should be a goal, with special relevance given to establishing limits for known carcinogens and other toxic substances in the environs of population centers, as well as industry-specific emission limits.},

abstract = {Background
Seasonal variation of relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) suggests that season-dependent factors, such as ambient air pollution, may trigger them. However, only few studies have considered possible role of air pollutants as relapse's risk factor.
Objective
We investigated the effect of particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10µm (PM10) on MS relapses.
Methods
In total, 536 relapsing MS patients from Strasbourg city (France) were included, accounting for 2052 relapses over 2000–2009 period. A case-crossover design was used with cases defined as the days of relapse and controls being selected in the same patient at plus and minus 35 days. Different lags from 0 to 30 days were considered. Conditional logistic regressions, adjusted on meteorological parameters, school and public holidays, were used and exposure was considered first as a quantitative variable and second, as a binary variable.
Results
The natural logarithm of the average PM10 concentration lagged from 1 to 3 days before relapse onset was significantly associated with relapse risk (OR =1.40 [95% confidence interval 1.08–1.81]) in cold season. Consistent results were observed when considering PM10 as a binary variable, even if not significant.
Conclusion
With an appropriate study design and robust ascertainment of neurological events and exposure, the present study highlights the effect of PM10 on the risk of relapse in MS patients, probably through oxidative stress mechanisms.},

abstract = {Objectives
Particulate air pollution is linked to adverse cardiovascular effects. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of short-term exposure to indoor particles on blood pressure (BP).
Methods
We analyzed the association of particle emissions from indoor sources (candle burning, toasting bread, frying sausages) with BP changes in 54 healthy volunteers in a randomized cross-over controlled exposure study. Particle mass concentration (PMC), size-specific particle number concentration (PNC) and lung-deposited particle surface area concentration (PSC) were measured during the 2h exposure. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured before, during, directly, 2, 4 and 24h after exposure. We performed multiple mixed linear regression analyses of different particle metrics and BP.
Results
BP significantly increased with increasing PMC, PSC and PNC resulting from toasting bread. For example, an increase per 10µg/m3 PM10 and PM2.5, systolic BP increased at all time points with largest changes 1h after exposure initiation of 1.5mmHg (95%-CI: 1.1; 1.9) and of 2.2mmHg (95%-CI: 1.3; 3.1), respectively.
Conclusions
Our study suggests an association of short-term exposure to fine and ultrafine particles emitted from toasting bread with increases in BP. Particles emitted from frying sausages and candle burning did not consistently affect BP.},

However, little is known about the association of short-term air pollution exposure with blood pressure (BP) in children. The goal of present study was to assess the association between short-term air pollution and BP in children from a highly polluted area in China. This study enrolled 9354 children in 24 elementary and middle schools (aged 5–17 years) from the Seven Northeast Cities (SNEC) study, respectively, during the period of 2012–2013. Ambient air pollutants, including particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) on the days (1–5 days) preceding BP examination were collected from local air monitoring stations. Generalized additive models and two-level regression analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between air pollution and BP after adjusting for other covariates. Results showed that with an interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM10 (50.0 $\mu$g/m3) and O3 (53.0 $\mu$g/m3) level during the 5-day mean exposure, positive associations with elevated BP were observed, with an odds ratio of 2.17 (95% CI, 1.61–2.93) for PM10 and 2.77 (95% CI, 1.94–3.95) for O3. Both systolic BP and diastolic BP levels were positively associated with an IQR increase of four air pollutants at different lag times. Specifically, an IQR increase in the 5-day mean of PM10 and O3 was associated with elevation of 2.07 mmHg (95% CI, 1.71–2.44) and 3.29 mmHg (95% CI, 2.86–3.72) in systolic BP, respectively. When stratified by sex, positive relationships were observed for elevated BP with NO2 exposure only in males. This is the first report on the relationship between ambient short-term air pollution exposure and children BP in China. Findings indicate a need to control air pollutants and protect children from heavy air pollution exposure in China.},

Hence, aiming of getting closer to the human in vivo conditions, primary human bronchial epithelial cells derived from normal subjects (NHBE) or sensitive chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-diseased patients (DHBE) were differentiated at the air-liquid interface. Thereafter, they were repeatedly exposed to air pollution-derived PM2.5 to study the occurrence of some relevant genetic and/or epigenetic endpoints. Concentration-, exposure- and season-dependent increases of OH-B[a]P metabolites in NHBE, and to a lesser extent, COPD-DHBE cells were reported; however, there were more tetra-OH-B[a]P and 8-OHdG DNA adducts in COPD-DHBE cells. No increase in primary DNA strand break nor chromosomal aberration was observed in repeatedly exposed cells. Telomere length and telomerase activity were modified in a concentration- and exposure-dependent manner in NHBE and particularly COPD-DHBE cells. There were a global DNA hypomethylation, a P16 gene promoter hypermethylation, and a decreasing DNA methyltransferase activity in NHBE and notably COPD-DHBE cells repeatedly exposed. Changes in site-specific methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation of histone H3 (i.e., H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac, and H3S10ph) and related enzyme activities occurred in a concentration- and exposure-dependent manner in all the repeatedly exposed cells. Collectively, these results highlighted the key role played by genetic and even epigenetic events in NHBE and particularly sensitive COPD-DHBE cells repeatedly exposed to air pollution-derived PM2.5 and their different responsiveness. While these specific epigenetic changes have been already described in COPD and even lung cancer phenotypes, our findings supported that, together with genetic events, these epigenetic events could dramatically contribute to the shift from healthy to diseased phenotypes following repeated exposure to relatively low doses of air pollution-derived PM2.5.},

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2011 was utilized for this analysis. The NIS is a national database that captures 20% of all US in-patient hospitalizations from 47 states. Patients with ARDS who underwent mechanical ventilation from the highest 15 ozone pollution cities were compared with the rest of the country. Secondary analyses assessed outcomes of ARDS patients for ozone pollution and particulate matter pollution on a continuous scale by county of residence. A total of 8,023,590 hospital admissions from the 2011 NIS sample were analyzed. There were 93,950 patients who underwent mechanical ventilation for ARDS included in the study. Patients treated in high ozone regions had significantly higher unadjusted hospital mortality (34.9% versus 30.8%, p < 0.01) than patients in cities with control levels of ozone. After controlling for all variables in the model, treatment in a hospital located in a high ozone pollution area was associated with an increased odds of in-hospital mortality (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.08–1.15, p < 0.01). After adjustment for all variables in the model, for each increase in ozone exposure by 0.01 ppm the OR for death was 1.07 (95% CI 1.06–1.08, p < 0.01). Similarly, for each increase in particulate matter exposure by 10 $\mu$g/m3, the OR for death was 1.08 (95% CI 1.02–1.16, p < 0.01). Chronic exposure to both ozone and particulate matter pollution is associated with higher rates of mortality in ARDS. These preliminary findings need to be confirmed by further detailed studies.},

abstract = {Background
Evolving animal studies and limited epidemiological data show that prenatal air pollution exposure is associated with childhood obesity. Timing of exposure and child sex may play an important role in these associations. We applied an innovative method to examine sex-specific sensitive prenatal windows of exposure to PM2.5 on anthropometric measures in preschool-aged children.
Methods
Analyses included 239 children born ≥ 37 weeks gestation in an ethnically-mixed lower-income urban birth cohort. Prenatal daily PM2.5 exposure was estimated using a validated satellite-based spatio-temporal model. Body mass index z-score (BMI-z), fat mass, % body fat, subscapular and triceps skinfold thickness, waist and hip circumferences and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were assessed at age 4.0 ± 0.7 years. Using Bayesian distributed lag interaction models (BDLIMs), we examined sex differences in sensitive windows of weekly averaged PM2.5 levels on these measures, adjusting for child age, maternal age, education, race/ethnicity, and pre-pregnancy BMI.
Results
Mothers were primarily Hispanic (55%) or Black (26%), had ≤ 12 years of education (66%) and never smoked (80%). Increased PM2.5 exposure 8–17 and 15–22 weeks gestation was significantly associated with increased BMI z-scores and fat mass in boys, but not in girls. Higher PM2.5 exposure 10–29 weeks gestation was significantly associated with increased WHR in girls, but not in boys. Prenatal PM2.5 was not significantly associated with other measures of body composition. Estimated cumulative effects across pregnancy, accounting for sensitive windows and within-window effects, were 0.21 (95%CI = 0.01–0.37) for BMI-z and 0.36 (95%CI = 0.12–0.68) for fat mass (kg) in boys, and 0.02 (95%CI = 0.01–0.03) for WHR in girls, all per µg/m3 increase in PM2.5.
Conclusions
Increased prenatal PM2.5 exposure was more strongly associated with indices of increased whole body size in boys and with an indicator of body shape in girls. Methods to better characterize vulnerable windows may provide insight into underlying mechanisms contributing to sex-specific associations.},

abstract = {Evidence supporting an inverse association between maternal exposure to air pollutants and foetal growth has been accumulating. However, the findings from Asian populations are limited, and the question of critical windows of exposure remains unanswered. We examined whether maternal exposure to air pollutants, in particular exposure during the first trimester (an important period of placental development), was associated with foetal growth in Japanese term infants. From the Japan Perinatal Registry Network database, we received birth data for 29,177 term singleton births in western Japan (Kyushu-Okinawa Districts) between 2005 and 2010. Exposure was expressed in terms of average concentrations of air pollutants (ozone, suspended particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and sulphur dioxide), as measured at the nearest monitoring stations to the respective delivery hospitals of the pregnant women, during the entire pregnancy and each trimester. As proxy markers of foetal growth restriction, we used small for gestational age (SGA), and adverse birth weight (low birth weight in addition to SGA). For pollutant exposure during the entire pregnancy, we did not observe the association with SGA and adverse birth weight. In the single-trimester model for the first trimester, however, we found a positive association between ozone exposure, and SGA (odds ratio [OR] per 10 ppb increase = 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–1.12) and adverse birth weight (OR = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.01–1.14). This association persisted in the multi-trimester model, and no association for exposure during the second or third trimester was observed. Exposure to other pollutants during each trimester was not associated with these outcomes. In conclusion, maternal exposure to ozone during the first trimester was independently associated with an elevated risk of poor foetal growth.},

Few studies investigated the associations between air pollution, meteorological factors, and COPD-related health disorders in Asian countries. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the environmental factors and COPD-associated ED visits of susceptible elderly population in the largest Taiwanese metropolitan area (Taipei area, including Taipei city and New Taipei city) between 2000 and 2013. Data of air pollutant concentrations (PM10, PM2.5, O3, SO2, NO2 and CO), meteorological factors (daily temperature, relative humidity and air pressure), and daily COPD-associated ED visits were collected from Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration air monitoring stations, Central Weather Bureau stations, and the Taiwan National Health Insurance database in Taipei area. We used a case-crossover study design and conditional logistic regression models with odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for evaluating the associations between the environmental factors and COPD-associated ED visits. Analyses showed that PM2.5, O3, and SO2 had significantly greater lag effects (the lag was 4 days for PM2.5, and 5 days for O3 and SO2) on COPD-associated ED visits of the elderly population (65–79 years old). In warmer days, a significantly greater effect on elderly COPD-associated ED visits was estimated for PM2.5 with coexistence of O3. Additionally, either O3 or SO2 combined with other air pollutants increased the risk of elderly COPD-associated ED visits in the days of high relative humidity and air pressure difference, respectively. This study showed that joint effect of urban air pollution and meteorological factors contributed to the COPD-associated ED visits of the susceptible elderly population in the largest metropolitan area in Taiwan. Government authorities should review existing air pollution policies, and strengthen health education propaganda to ensure the health of the susceptible elderly population.},

abstract = {According to the WHO, 3 million deaths are attributable to air pollution due to particulate matter (PM) world-wide. However, there are no specific updated studies which calculate short-term PM-related cause specific mortality in Spain. The objective is to quantify the relative risks (RRs) and attributable risks (ARs) of daily mortality associated with PM10 concentrations, registered in Spanish provinces and to calculate the number of PM-related deaths. We calculated daily mortality due to natural (ICD-10: A00 R99), circulatory (ICD-10: I00 I99) and respiratory causes (ICD-10: J00 J99) for each province across the period 2000–2009. Mean daily concentrations of PM10, NO2 and O3 was used. For the estimate of RRs and ARs, we used generalised linear models with a Poisson link. A meta-analysis was used to estimate RRs and ARs in the provinces with statically significant results. The overall RRs obtained for these provinces, corresponding to increases of 10 $\mu$ g/m3 in PM10 concentrations were 1.009 (95% CI: 1.006 1011) for natural, 1.026 (95% CI: 1.019 1033) for respiratory, and 1.009 (95% CI: 1.006 1012) for circulatory-cause mortality. This amounted to an annual overall total of 2683 deaths (95% CI: 852 4354) due to natural, 651 (95% CI: 359 1026) due to respiratory, and 556 (95% CI: 116 1012) due to circulatory causes, with 90% of this mortality lying below the WHO guideline values. This study provides an updated estimate of the effect had by this type of pollutant on causes of mortality, and constitutes an important basis for reinforcing public health measures.},

abstract = {Air pollution is associated with risks of mortality in China, but the evidence is still limited for morbidity. This study aims to examine overall effects of ambient air pollutants on emergency hospital visits (EHVs) at the national level in China and calculate corresponding attributable risks. We collected daily data for EHVs from 33 largest hospitals in China between Oct 2013 and Dec 2014, as well as daily measurements of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5: particles with aerodynamic diameter < 10 $\mu$m and 2.5 $\mu$m, respectively), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) from 31 cities where the hospitals were located. Firstly, quasi-Poisson regression with a constrained distributed lag model (CDLM) was employed to examine city-specific associations of EHVs with each pollutant. Then, the effects at the national scale were pooled with a random-effect meta-analysis. Daily EHVs was significantly associated with a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 at lag 0–2 days [cumulative relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.006 (1.002, 1.009)], PM10 at lag 0–1 days [1.004 (1.002, 1.006)], NO2 at lag 0–1 days [1.015 (1.010, 1.019)] and SO2 at lag 0–2 days [1.022 (1.014, 1.030)]. The effect estimates were not modified by sex, but stronger effects were observed among children than adults. Overall, 3.34% of EHVs may result from exposure to ambient PM2.5, 3.96% to PM10, 5.90% to NO2 and 5.38% to SO2. Exposure to outdoor air pollution has acute effects on EHVs. Effective measures to control air pollution levels in China could potentially reduce demands for emergency hospital services.},

abstract = {Objective
The evidence is limited about the potentially different health effects of various chemical constituents of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We thus assessed the acute effects of various chemical constituents of PM2.5 on blood pressure (BP).
Methods
We performed a longitudinal panel study with six repeated visits in 28 urban residents with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Shanghai, China from May to July, 2014. Twelve (43%) of them took antihypertensive medications. We measured resting BP by using a mercury sphygmomanometer and monitored real-time concentrations of PM2.5 constituents at a nearby site. Based on the linear mixed-effects model, we evaluated the effects of 10 major constituents in PM2.5 on BP, using a single-constituent model and a constituent-residual model after accounting for the multicollinearity.
Results
We obtained a total of 168 pairs of effective BP measurements during the study period. There are moderate or high correlations among various PM2.5 constituents. An interquartile range increase of PM2.5 (19.1$\mu$g/m3) was associated with increments of 1.90mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.66, 3.13] in systolic BP, 0.68mmHg (95%CI: −0.02, 1.37) in diastolic BP and 1.23mmHg (95%CI: 0.19, 2.29) in pulse pressure. Some constituents of PM2.5, including organic carbon, elemental carbon, nitrate and ammonium, were robustly associated with elevated BP after controlling for total PM2.5 mass and accounting for multi-collinearity. Two constituents (magnesium and calcium) were associated with decreased BP.
Conclusions
Organic carbon, elemental carbon, nitrate and ammonium may be mainly responsible for elevated BP from a short-term exposure to PM2.5.},

abstract = {Background:
Ambient air pollution has been associated with certain congenital anomalies, but few studies rely on assessment of fine-scale variation in air quality and associations with noise from road traffic are unexplored.
Methods:
Among 84,218 liveborn singletons (1997–2002) from the Danish National Birth Cohort with complete covariate data and residential address history from conception until birth, we identified major congenital anomalies in 4018 children. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and noise from road traffic (Lden) burden during fetal life was modeled. Outcome and covariate data were derived from registries, hospital records and questionnaires. Odds ratios (ORs) for eleven major anomaly groups associated with road traffic pollution during first trimester were estimated using logistic regression with generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach.
Results:
Most of the associations tested did not suggest increased risks. A 10-µg/m3 increase in NO2 exposure during first trimester was associated with an adjusted ORs of 1.22 (95% confidence interval: 0.98–1.52) for ear, face and neck anomalies; 1.14 0.98–1.33) for urinary anomalies. A 10-dB increase in road traffic noise was also associated with these subgroups of anomalies as well as with an increased OR for orofacial cleft anomalies (1.17, 0.94–1.47). Inverse associations for several both air pollution and noise were observed for atrial septal defects (0.85, 0.68–1.04 and 0.81, 0.65–0.99, respectively).
Conclusions:
Residential road traffic exposure to noise or air pollution during pregnancy did not seem to pose a risk for development of congenital anomalies.},

abstract = {Background
Large cohort studies have been used to characterise the association between long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution with non-accidental, and cause-specific mortality. However, there has been no consensus as to the shape of the association between concentration and response.
Methods
To examine the shape of this association, we developed a new cohort based on respondents to the 2001 Canadian census long-form. We applied new annual PM2.5 concentration estimates based on remote sensing and ground measurements for Canada at a 1km spatial scale from 1998 to 2011. We followed 2.4 million respondents who were non-immigrants aged 25–90 years and did not reside in an institution over a 10 year period for mortality. Exposures were assigned as a 3-year mean prior to the follow-up year. Income tax files were used to account for residential mobility among respondents using postal codes, with probabilistic imputation used for missing postal codes in the tax data. We used Cox survival models to determine hazard ratios (HRs) for cause-specific mortality. We also estimated Shape Constrained Health Impact Functions (a concentration-response function) for selected causes of death.
Results
In models stratified by age, sex, airshed, and population centre size, and adjusted for individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic variables, HR estimates for non-accidental mortality were HR = 1.18 (95% CI: 1.15–1.21) per 10$\mu$g/m3 increase in concentration. We observed higher HRs for cardiovascular disease (HR=1.25; 95% CI: 1.19–1.31), cardio-metabolic disease (HR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.21–1.33), ischemic heart disease (HR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.28–1.44) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality (HR = 1.24; 95% CI: 1.11–1.39) compared to HR for all non-accidental causes of death. For non-accidental, cardio-metabolic, ischemic heart disease, respiratory and COPD mortality, the shape of the concentration-response curve was supra-linear, with larger differences in relative risk for lower concentrations. For both pneumonia and lung cancer, there was some suggestion that the curves were sub-linear.
Conclusions
Associations between ambient concentrations of fine particulate matter and several causes of death were non-linear for each cause of death examined.},

Different gender (male and female) and age groups (15yrs ≤ age <65 yrs and age ≥ 65 yrs) were also examined by single model and multiple-pollutant model. Three major pollutants (SO2, NO2 and PM10) had lag effects of 0–2 days on cardiovascular ER admissions. The relative risks (95% CI) of per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10, SO2 and NO2 were 1.008 (0.997–1.020), 1.008(0.999–1.018) and 1.014(1.003–1.024), respectively. The effect was more pronounced in age ≥65 and males in Beijing. We also found the stronger acute effects on the elderly and females at lag 0 than on the younger people and males at lag 2.},

abstract = {Various epidemiological studies conducted in different parts of the world have conclusively established that the adverse health effects are associated with common urban air pollutants. Although several recent studies revealed the poor air quality status in Delhi, but limited evidence of the impact of criterion air pollutants on human health remains a big limitation for relevant policy changes. So we conducted a time series to estimate the short term effects of ambient air pollution on all-natural-cause mortality in Delhi for the period 2008 to 2010. The study examined the impact of criteria air pollutants [particulate matter less than 10 $\mu$m in diameter (PM10), sulphur di-oxide (SO2), Nitrogen di-oxide (NO2), Carbon monoxide (CO) and Ozone (O3)] on daily all-cause-mortality rate. A semi-parametric regression model was developed to estimate the short term effects of air pollutants on daily all-natural-cause-mortality adjusting nonlinear confounding of time, temperature and relative humidity. A significant association of all-natural-cause mortality in association with short-term exposure to particulate as well as the gaseous pollutants were observed. The study estimated 0.14% (95% CI 0.02%–0.26%) increase in all-cause-mortality for every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10 concentration. Among the gaseous pollutants, NO2 has been found to show most significant positive association of 1.00% (95% CI 0.07%–1.93%) increase in all-cause-mortality with every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in daily NO2 concentration. The effect of O3 and CO has been observed to be significant after controlling the effects of NO2. Analysis by different age groups reveals that particulate matter has maximum effect estimate in the age group ≥65 years (RR 1.002, 95% CI 1.000 to 1.004) whereas gaseous pollutants have been found to exhibit maximum effect estimate (RR 1.016, 95% CI 1.002 to 1.030) in the age group 5–44 years. The results of the present effect estimates appeared consistent with previous findings and can enhance the strength of the previous evidences to understand health burden associated with local air quality.},

abstract = {In recent years, air pollution has become an alarming problem in China. However, evidence on the effects of air pollution on cardiovascular mortality is still not conclusive to date. This research aimed to assess the short-term effects of air pollution on cardiovascular morbidity in Hefei, China. Data of air pollution, cardiovascular mortality, and meteorological characteristics in Hefei between 2010 and 2015 were collected. Time-series analysis in generalized additive model was applied to evaluate the association between air pollution and daily cardiovascular mortality. During the study period, the annual average concentration of PM10, SO2, and NO2 was 105.91, 20.58, and 30.93 $\mu$g/m3, respectively. 21,816 people (including 11,876 man, and 14,494 people over 75 years of age) died of cardiovascular diseases. In single pollutant model, the effects of multi-day exposure were greater than single-day exposure of the air pollution. For every increase of 10 $\mu$g/m3 in SO2, NO2, and PM10 levels, CVD mortality increased by 5.26% (95%CI: 3.31%–7.23%), 2.71% (95%CI: 1.23%–4.22%), and 0.68% (95%CI: 0.33%–1.04%) at a lag03, respectively. The multi-pollutant models showed that PM10 and SO2 remained associated with CVD mortality, although the effect estimates attenuated. However, the effect of NO2 on CVD mortality decreased to statistically insignificant. Subgroup analyses further showed that women were more vulnerable than man upon air pollution exposure. These findings showed that air pollution could significantly increase the CVD mortality.},

abstract = {Background
Biological perturbations caused by air pollution might be reflected in the compounds present in blood originating from air pollutants and endogenous metabolites influenced by air pollution (defined here as part of the blood metabolome). We aimed to assess the perturbation of the blood metabolome in response to short term exposure to air pollution.
Methods
We exposed 31 healthy volunteers to ambient air pollution for 5h. We measured exposure to particulate matter, particle number concentrations, absorbance, elemental/organic carbon, trace metals, secondary inorganic components, endotoxin content, gaseous pollutants, and particulate matter oxidative potential. We collected blood from the participants 2h before and 2 and 18h after exposure. We employed untargeted metabolite profiling to monitor 3873 metabolic features in 493 blood samples from these volunteers. We assessed lung function using spirometry and six acute phase proteins in peripheral blood. We assessed the association of the metabolic features with the measured air pollutants and with health markers that we previously observed to be associated with air pollution in this study.
Results
We observed 89 robust associations between air pollutants and metabolic features two hours after exposure and 118 robust associations 18h after exposure. Some of the metabolic features that were associated with air pollutants were also associated with acute health effects, especially changes in forced expiratory volume in 1s. We successfully identified tyrosine, guanosine, and hypoxanthine among the associated features. Bioinformatics approach Mummichog predicted enriched pathway activity in eight pathways, among which tyrosine metabolism.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates for the first time the application of untargeted metabolite profiling to assess the impact of air pollution on the blood metabolome.},

We applied the Community Multiscale Air Quality model using the Decoupled Direct Method to isolate PM2.5- or O3-related contributions from precursor pollutants emitted by 66 individual airports. We linked airport- and pollutant-specific concentrations with population data and literature-based concentration-response functions to create health damage functions. Deaths per 1000t of primary PM2.5 emissions ranged from 3 to 160 across airports, with variability explained by population patterns within 500km of the airport. Deaths per 1000t of precursors for secondary PM2.5 varied across airports from 0.1 to 2.7 for NOx, 0.06 to 2.9 for SO2, and 0.06 to 11 for VOCs, with variability explained by population patterns and ambient concentrations influencing particle formation. Deaths per 1000t of O3 precursors ranged from −0.004 to 1.0 for NOx and 0.03 to 1.5 for VOCs, with strong seasonality and influence of ambient concentrations. Our findings reinforce the importance of location- and source-specific health damage functions in design of health-maximizing emissions control policies.},

abstract = {Severe and persistent haze accompanied by high concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has become a great public health concern in urban China. However, research on the health effects of PM2.5 in China has been hindered by the lack of high-quality exposure estimates. In this study, we assessed the excess mortality associated with both short- and long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 simultaneously using satellite-derived exposure data at a high spatiotemporal resolution. Adult registries of non-accidental, respiratory and cardiovascular deaths in urban Beijing in 2013 were collected. Exposure levels were estimated from daily satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations at 1 km spatial resolution from 2004 to 2013. Mixed Poisson regression models were fitted to estimate the cause-specific mortality in association with PM2.5 exposures. With the mutual adjustment of short- and long-term exposure of PM2.5, the percent increases associated with every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in short-term PM2.5 exposure were 0.09% (95% CI: −0.14%, 0.33%; lag 01), 1.02% (95% CI: 0.08%, 1.97%; lag 04) and 0.09% (95% CI: −0.23%, 0.42%; lag 01) for non-accidental, respiratory and cardiovascular mortality, respectively; those attributable to every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in long-term PM2.5 exposure (9-year moving average) were 16.78% (95% CI: 10.58%, 23.33%), 44.14% (95% CI: 20.73%, 72.10%) and 3.72% (95% CI: −3.75%, 11.77%), respectively. Both associations of short- and long-term exposure with the cause-specific mortality decreased after they were mutually adjusted. Associations between short-term exposure to satellite-based PM2.5 and cause-specific mortality were larger than those estimated using fixed measurements. Satellite-based PM2.5 predictions help to improve the spatiotemporal resolution of exposure assessments and the mutual adjustment model provide better estimation of PM2.5 associated health effects. Effects attributable to long-term exposure of PM2.5 were larger than those of short-term exposure, which should be more concerned for public health.},

abstract = {Air pollution-exposure is associated with detrimental outcomes in the central nervous system (CNS) such as cerebrovascular disorders, including stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases. While the mechanisms of these CNS-related outcomes involved have not been fully elucidated, exposure to traffic-generated air pollutants has been associated with altered blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity and permeability. The current study investigated whether inhalation exposure to mixed vehicle emissions (MVE) alters cerebral microvascular integrity in healthy 3 mo old C57BL/6 mice, as well as whether exposure-mediated effects were exacerbated by a high-fat (HF) vs. low-fat (LF) diet. Mice on each diet were randomly assigned to be exposed to either filtered air (FA) or MVE [100PM/m3 vehicle emissions mixture: 30µg PM/m3 gasoline engine + 70µg PM/m3 diesel engine emissions; median size $\sim$ 60nm; particle mass size distribution median of $\sim$ 1µm (range: < 0.5–20µm)] for 6h/d, 7d/wk, for 30d. Using sodium fluorescein as a tracer, we observed a significant increase in BBB permeability in both HF + MVE exposed and HF + FA animals, compared to LF + FA controls. Exposure to HF + MVE also led to a significant increase plasma ox-LDL and ox-LDL scavenger receptors (LOX-1 and CD-36) expression in the cerebral vasculature. Histological analysis revealed decreased expression of TJ protein, claudin-5, associated with increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)−9 activity and oxidative stress in the cerebral vasculature of HF + MVE mice, compared to LF + MVE. Such findings indicate that inhalation exposure to traffic-generated pollutants, coupled with a HF diet, results in altered BBB integrity and increased ox-LDL signaling in the cerebral vasculature in a wildtype animal model.},

This is the first study to use patient-level data to examine the effects of trans-Pacific air pollution from China on morbidity in the U.S. We show that heavy sandstorms are associated with a modest increase in acute respiratory disease per capita, representing 0.5–4.6% of average weekly hospitalizations. However, we find no significant effect on morbidity in California from Chinese New Year.

abstract = {Background
Metro system has become popular in urban areas. However, short-term effects of size-fractionated particulate matter (PM) on cardiac autonomic function in metro system remain unexplored.
Objectives
To explore the contribution of ambient PM to in-cabin PM and investigate the short-term effects of exposure to size-fractionated PM and black carbon (BC) in metro system on cardiac autonomic function in young healthy adults.
Methods
Thirty nine young healthy adults were asked to travel in metro system during 9:00–13:00 on a weekends between March and May 2017. We performed continuous ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring for each of them, and measured real-time size-fractionated PM, BC, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide, carbon dioxide, ozone, noise, temperature and relative humidity in metro cabin. We also collected the data of ambient PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 µm) concentrations in Beijing. Linear regression model was used to estimate the infiltration factor of ambient PM2.5 to assess the relationship between metro cabin PM and ambient PM. Mixed-effects model was used to estimate the associations between changes in HRV parameters and PM0.5 (aerodynamic diameter < 0.5 µm), PM0.5–2.5 (aerodynamic diameter between 0.5 µm and 2.5 µm), PM2.5–10 (aerodynamic diameter between 2.5 µm and 10 µm), and BC, respectively.
Results
We found that size-fractionated PM in metro systems were significantly associated with HRV parameters. Per IQR (interquartile range) increase in PM0.5 (1.6*107/m3) in 1-h moving average concentration was associated with a 13.96% (95% CI: − 18.99%, − 8.61%) decrease in SDNN (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals). Similar inverse associations were found between size-fractionated PM exposure and LF (low frequency power), HF (high frequency power), respectively, and smaller particles had greater effects on HRV parameters at shorter lag time. Sex of participants modified the adverse associations between size-fractionated PM and HRV. An IQR of 1-h PM0.5 increasing was associated with a decrease of 6.05% (95% CI: − 22.87%, − 14.44%) in males and a 34.87% (95% CI: − 49.59%, − 15.85%) in females in LF (P for interaction = 0.026). The infiltration factor of ambient PM2.5 was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.45). It is estimated that PM2.5 originated from ambient air may account for 20.2% of the PM measured in metro cabin. Per IQR increase in BC (5.5 $\mu$g/m3) in 5-min, 1-h, and 2-h moving averages, a primary tracer for ambient PM from combustion source, was associated with decreases of 0.84% (95% CI: − 1.20%, − 0.47%), 2.22% (95% CI: − 3.20%, − 1.22%), and 4.44% (95% CI: − 6.28%, − 2.56%) in SDNN, respectively.
Conclusions
Short-term exposure to PM may disturb metro commuter's cardiac autonomic function, and the potential effects depend on the size of PM and the sex of commuters. Ambient PM from combustion source may have adverse effects on the cardiac autonomic function of passengers in cabin.},

This work aims to evaluate the public health benefits of improved air quality in Brazil, based on the estimated reduction in mortality from PM2.5, a pollutant commonly related to all causes mortality including non-accidental, cardiovascular, ischemic heart diseases and lung cancer. Annual PM2.5 concentrations were obtained from 50 monitoring stations spread across 24 Brazilian cities between the years 2000 and 2017, which constituted the baseline scenario. The control scenario was represented by the annual PM2.5 guideline values (10 $\mu$g m−3) of the World Health Organization (WHO). The relationship between the change in baseline and control scenarios with health effects was estimated using the BenMAP-CE program and the application of exposure-response functions. S{\~{a}}o Paulo city showed the highest number of avoidable deaths, with values ranging from 28,874 ± 9769 and 82,720 ± 24,549 for all causes from 2000 to 2017. In 2009, just three Brazilian cities were monitoring PM2.5. Between 877 ± 295 and 2497 ± 719 all causes avoidable deaths related to PM2.5 were estimated under the scenario when the WHO guideline was applied. In 2017, the 15 cities with representative annual PM2.5 data account for between 2378 ± 801 and 6282 ± 1818 avoidable deaths due to all-cause PM2.5 mortality, between 2974 ± 376 and 10,397 ± 516 avoidable deaths due non-accidental causes, between 1373 ± 230 and 3428 ± 265 avoidable deaths due cardiovascular disease, between 927 ± 162 and 2514 ± 156 avoidable deaths due ischemic heart diseases and the lowest between 101 ± 45 and 264 ± 88 avoidable deaths due to lung cancer.},

abstract = {The impact of ambient air pollution on pregnant women is a concern in China. However, little is known about the association between air pollution and preeclampsia and the potential modifying effects of meteorological conditions have not been assessed. This study aimed to assess the effects of prenatal exposure to air pollution on preeclampsia, and to explore whether temperature and humidity modify the effects. We performed a retrospective cohort study based on 1.21 million singleton births from the birth registration system in Shenzhen, China, between 2005 and 2012. Daily average measurements of particulate matter <10 $\mu$m (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), air temperature (T), and dew point (Td) were collected. Logistic regression models were performed to estimate associations between air pollution and preeclampsia during the first and second trimesters, and during the entire pregnancy. In each time window, we observed a positive gradient of increasing preeclampsia risk with increasing quartiles of PM10 and SO2 exposure. When stratified by T and Td in three categories (<5th, 5th −95th, and >95th percentile), we found a significant interaction between PM10 and Td on preeclampsia; the adverse effects of PM10 increased with Td. During the entire pregnancy, there was a null association between PM10 and preeclampsia under Td < 5th percentile. Preeclampsia risk increased by 23% (95% CI: 19–26%) when 5th < Td < 95th percentile, and by 34% (16–55%) when Td > 95th percentile. We also found that air pollution effects on preeclampsia in autumn/winter seasons were stronger than those in the spring/summer. This is the first study to address modifying effects of meteorological factors on the association between air pollution and preeclampsia. Findings indicate that prenatal exposure to PM10 and SO2 increase preeclampsia risk in Shenzhen, China, and the effects could be modified by humidity. Pregnant women should limit air pollution exposure, particularly during humid periods.},

abstract = {Background
Air pollution is associated with several adverse health outcomes in children, such as respiratory illnesses and cognitive development impairment. There are suggestions of an effect of traffic-related air pollution on the occurrence of childhood obesity, but the results are not consistent.
Objectives
The aim of the study is to analyse whether air pollution and vehicular traffic exposure, during the first four years of life, influence obesity- related measures among 4 and 8-year-old children from a prospective birth cohort in Rome.
Methods
A cohort of newborns, enrolled in 2003–2004 within the GASPII project, was followed at 4 and 8 years of age with parental interviews and clinical examinations. Air pollution was assessed at residential address using Land Use Regression models (for NO2, NOx, PM10, PM2.5, PMcoarse, PM2.5 absorbance and one traffic variable (Total traffic load of all roads in a 100m buffer)). The outcomes under study were body mass index (BMI Z-scores according to WHO recommendations, considered both categorical and continuous) measured at 4 and 8 years, and, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, total and HDL cholesterol measured at 8 years. The associations were evaluated through both cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches, using logistic regression models, Generalized Estimating Equation models (GEE) and linear regression models, as appropriate. Moreover, Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) methodology was used to account for selection bias at enrolment and at follow-up.
Results
A total of 719 infants were enrolled and 581 (80.8%) and 499 (69.4%) were followed at 4 and 8 years, respectively. The prevalence of overweight/obesity was 9.3% and 36.9% at 4 and 8 years. No evidence of an association was found between vehicular traffic and being overweight/obese. Similarly, there was no evidence of an association between exposure to air pollutants and all other ponderal excess parameters.
Conclusions
The study shows no association between exposure to vehicular traffic and exposure to pollutants on obesity related parameters such as BMI, blood lipids and abdominal adiposity during childhood. Overall evidence of air pollution being obesogenic remains limited.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the human health impacts of criteria air pollutants including PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO and O3 on the citizens of Hamadan using AirQ model software 2.2.3. Considering the determined baseline incidence (BI) and relative risk (RR) rate, the attributable proportion (AP) of deaths due to cardiovascular and respiratory mortality attributed to PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, and CO pollutants was estimated to be 4.42%, 3.37%, 1.75%, 1.74% and 0.92% (95% CI) of the total mortality and the excess death cases were respectively estimated to be 131.9, 100.4, 52.1, 51.9 and 27.3 persons. In addition, cardiovascular mortality brings more contribution than respiratory mortality in total death number. The results of our study also showed that PM2.5 poses the greatest health effects on the citizens. Analyzing the average seasonal concentrations of studied pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, and NO2) and the mean seasonal temperature values revealed a positive linear correlation. Significant negative correlations were observed between the studied pollutants (PM10, PM2.5 and NO2) and relative humidity, and between PM and wind speed. This study, therefore, provides additional data in decision-makings for the development of strategies for reduction of ambient air pollution which will result in improvements of air quality.},

abstract = {The effect of ambient air pollution exposure on childhood hypertension has emerged as a concern in China, and previous studies suggested pet ownership is associated with lower blood pressure (BP). However, limited information exists on the interactive effects pet ownership and air pollution exposure has on hypertension. We investigated the interactions between exposure to pet ownership and air pollutants on hypertension in Chinese children. 9354 students in twenty-four elementary and middle schools (aged 5–17 years) in Northeastern China were evaluated during 2012–2013. Four-year average concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10), SO2, NO2, and O3, were collected in the 24 districts from 2009 to 2012. Hypertension was defined as average diastolic or systolic BP (three time measurements) in the 95th percentile or higher based on height, age, and sex. To examine effects, two-level regression analysis was used, controlling covariates. Consistent interactions between exposure to pet and air pollutants were observed. Compared to children exposed to pet, those not exposed exhibited consistently stronger effects of air pollution. The highest odds ratios (ORs) per 30.6 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10 were 1.79 (95%confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.29–2.50) in children without current pet exposure compared to 1.24 (95%CI: 0.85–1.82) in children with current pet exposure. As for BP, only O3 had an interaction for all exposure to pet ownership types, and showed lower BP in children exposed to pet. The increases in mean diastolic BP per 46.3 $\mu$g/m3 increase in O3 were 0.60  mmHg (95%CI: 0.21, 0.48) in children without pet exposure in utero compared with 0.34  mmHg (95%CI: 0.21, 0.48) in their counterparts. When stratified by age, pet exposure was more protective among younger children. In conclusion, in this large population-based cohort, pet ownership is associated with smaller associations between air pollution and hypertension in children, suggesting pet ownership reduces susceptibility to the health effects of pollutants.},

abstract = {Air pollution represents a continuous hazard to human health. Administration, companies and population need efficient indicators of the possible effects given by a change in decision, strategy or habit. The monetary quantification of health effects of air pollution through the definition of external costs is increasingly recognized as a useful indicator to support decision and information at all levels. The development of modelling tools for the calculation of external costs can provide support to analysts in the development of consistent and comparable assessments. In this paper, the DIATI Dispersion and Externalities Model (DIDEM) is presented. The DIDEM model calculates the delta-external costs of air pollution comparing two alternative emission scenarios. This tool integrates CALPUFF's advanced dispersion modelling with the latest WHO recommendations on concentration-response functions. The model is based on the impact pathway method. It was designed to work with a fine spatial resolution and a local or national geographic scope. The modular structure allows users to input their own data sets. The DIDEM model was tested on a real case study, represented by a comparative analysis of the district heating system in Turin, Italy. Additional advantages and drawbacks of the tool are discussed in the paper. A comparison with other existing models worldwide is reported.},

abstract = {Background
Prenatal particulate air pollution exposure may alter lung growth and development in utero in a time-sensitive and sex-specific manner, resulting in reduced lung function in childhood. Such relationships have not been examined for nitrate (NO3-).
Methods
We implemented Bayesian distributed lag interaction models (BDLIMs) to identify sensitive prenatal windows for the influence of NO3- on lung function at age 7 years, assessing effect modification by fetal sex. Analyses included 191 mother-child dyads. Daily ambient NO3- exposure over pregnancy was estimated using a hybrid chemical transport (Geos-Chem)/land-use regression model. Spirometry was performed at mean (SD) age of 6.99 (0.89) years, with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) z-scores accounting for child age, sex, height and race/ethnicity.
Results
Most mothers were Hispanic (65%) or Black (22%), had ≤ high school education (67%), and never smoked (71%); 17% children had asthma. BDILMs adjusted for maternal age and education and child's asthma identified an early sensitive window of 6–12 weeks gestation, during which increased NO3- was significantly associated with reduced FEV1 z-scores specifically among boys. BDLIM analyses demonstrated similar sex-specific patterns for FVC.
Conclusion
Early gestational NO3- exposure is associated with reduced child lung function, especially in boys.},

abstract = {Obesity and exposure to particular matter (PM) have become two leading global threats to public health. However, the exact mechanisms and tissue-specificity of their health effects are largely unknown. Here we investigate whether a metabolic challenge (early nutritional obesity) synergistically interacts with an environmental challenge (PM exposure) to alter genes representing key response pathways, in a tissue-specific manner. Mice subjected to 7 weeks obesogenic nutrition were exposed every other day during the final week and a half to aqueous extracts of PM collected in the city of London (UK). The expression of 61 selected genes representing key response pathways were investigated in lung, liver, white and brown adipose tissues. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed distinct patterns of expression changes between the 4 tissues, particularly in the lungs and the liver. Surprisingly, the lung responded to the nutrition challenge. The response of these organs to the PM challenge displayed opposite patterns for some key genes, in particular, those related to the Nrf2 pathway. While the contribution to the variance in gene expression changes in mice exposed to the combined challenge were largely similar among the tissues in PCA1, PCA2 exhibited predominant contribution of inflammatory and oxidative stress responses to the variance in the lungs, and a greater contribution of autophagy genes and MAP kinases in adipose tissues. Possible involvement of alterations in DNA methylation was demonstrated by cell-type-specific responses to a methylation inhibitor. Correspondingly, the DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a2 increased in the lungs but decreased in the liver, demonstrating potential tissue-differential synergism between nutritional and PM exposure. The results suggest that urban PM, containing dissolved metals, interacts with obesogenic nutrition to regulate diverse response pathways including inflammation and oxidative stress, in a tissue-specific manner. Tissue-differential effects on DNA methylation may underlie tissue-specific responses to key stress-response genes such as catalase and Nrf2.},

We employed a generalized mixed effects model to examine the association between PM2.5 and the prevalence of diabetes and explored potential effect modifiers. We estimated diabetes burden attributable to ambient PM2.5 if the observed association is indeed causal. The diabetes prevalence among the participants was 6.5% (n = 745). Our analysis found a statistically significant association between PM2.5 and diabetes. The adjusted odds ratio was 1.27 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12, 1.43) for each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increment in ambient PM2.5. Stratified analyses found a lower association among the participants with higher consumption of fruit. We estimated that 22.02% (95% CI: 8.59%, 43.29%) of the diabetes cases could be ascribable to ambient PM2.5. Our finding suggests that PM2.5 exposures could increase the risk of diabetes, and if causal, could be responsible for substantial burden of diabetes among the Chinese elderly; and higher intakes of fruit might reduce the harmful effects of PM2.5, however, due to the limitation of the cross-sectional study design, more studies are warranted to confirm this observation.},

abstract = {Background
In utero exposure to particulate matter (PM) from a range of sources is associated with adverse post-natal health; however, the effect of maternal exposure to community-sampled PM on early post-natal lung and immune development is poorly understood.
Objectives
Using a mouse model, we aimed to determine whether in utero exposure to PM alters early post-natal lung function and immune cell populations. We used PM collected from ceiling voids in suburban houses as a proxy for community PM exposure.
Methods
Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were intranasally exposed to ceiling derived PM, or saline alone, at gestational day (E) 13.5, 15.5, and 17.5. When mice were two weeks old, we assessed lung function by the forced oscillation technique, and enumerated T and B cell populations in the spleen and thymus by flow cytometry.
Results
Maternal exposure to PM impaired somatic growth of male offspring resulting in reduced lung volume and deficits in lung function. There was no effect on thymic T cell populations in dams and their male offspring but PM decreased the CD4 +CD25 + T cell population in the female offspring. In contrast, maternal exposure to PM increased splenic CD3 +CD4 + and CD3 +CD8 + T cells in dams, and there was some evidence to suggest inhibition of splenic T cell maturation in male but not female offspring.
Conclusions
Our findings suggested that maternal exposure to ceiling void PM has the capacity to impair early somatic growth and alter early life immune development in a sex specific manner.},

abstract = {Background
Long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (≤ 2.5 $\mu$g/m3 in aerodynamic diameter; PM2.5) is significantly associated with increased risk of premature mortality. Our goal was to provide an updated meta-analysis of all-cause and cause-specific mortality associated with exposure to PM2.5 and to better estimate the risk of death as a function of air pollution levels.
Methods
We systematically searched all published cohort studies examining the association between long term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality. We applied multivariate linear random effects meta-analysis with random effects for cohort, and study within cohort. Meta-regression techniques were used to test whether study population or analytic characteristics modify the PM2.5 -mortality association and to estimate the shape of the concentration-response curve.
Results
A total of 53 studies that provided 135 estimates of the quantitative association between the risk of mortality and exposure to PM2.5 were included in the meta-analysis. There were 39 studies from North America, 8 from Europe, and 6 from Asia. Since 2015, 17 studies of long-term air pollution exposure have been published, covering, wider geographic areas with a wider range of mean exposures (e.g. <12 or > 20 $\mu$g/m3). A penalized spline showed the slope decreased at higher concentrations but appeared to level off. We found that the inverse transform of average PM2.5 well approximated that spline and provided a parametric estimate that fit better than a linear or logarithmic term for average PM2.5. In addition, we found that studies using space time exposure models or fixed monitors at Zip-code scale (as compared to land use regression method), or additionally controlling for area level socio-economic status, or with mean exposure less than 10 $\mu$g/m3 were associated with higher mortality effect estimates.
Conclusions
This meta-analysis provides strong evidence for the adverse effect of PM2.5 on mortality, that studies with poorer exposure have lower effect size estimates, that more control for SES increases effect size estimates, and that significant effects are seen below 10 µg/m3. The concentration -response function produced here can be further applied in the global health risk assessment of air particulate matter.},

The individual-level variables, including gender, age, family history of asthma and allergic diseases, breastfeeding, parental smoking, indoor dampness, interior decoration pollution, household annual income, and city-level variable-annual temperature were adjusted.

Apart from family history, indoor dampness, and decoration as predominant risk factors, we found that an increase of 10 $\mu$g/m3 of the annual PM2.5 was positively associated with the prevalence of allergic rhinitis by an odds ratio (OR) of 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11, 1.29) and diagnosed asthma by OR of 1.10 (95% CI 1.03, 1.18). Those who lived in non-urban (vs. urban) areas were exposed to more severe indoor air pollution arising from biomass combustion and had significantly higher ORs between PM2.5 and allergic rhinitis and current rhinitis. Our study suggested that long-term exposure to PM2.5 might increase the risks of asthmatic and allergic diseases or symptoms in preschool children in China. Compared to those living in urban areas, children living in suburban or rural areas had a higher risk of PM2.5 exposure.},

abstract = {Aims
Air particulate matter (PM) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Altered autonomic functions play a key role in PM-induced cardiovascular disease. However, previous studies have not address the impact of PM on sympathetic and parasympathetic control of heart function, independently, and using controlled conditions, i.e., increasing titration of PM of known composition, in absence of other potential confounding factors. To fill this gap, here we used symbolic analysis that is capable of detecting non-mutual changes of the two autonomic branches, thus considering them as independent, and concentrations of PM as they could be measured at peak levels in Milan during a polluted winter day.
Methods and results
In this randomized, cross-over study, we enrolled 12 healthy subjects who underwent two random sessions: inhalation of filtered air mixture or inhalation of filtered air containing particulate mixture (PM 10, PM 2.5, PM 1.0 and PM 0.5µm). ECG and respiration for autonomic analysis and blood sample for DNA Methylation were collected at baseline (T1), after air exposure (T2) and after 2h (T3). Spectral and symbolic analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) were performed for autonomic control of cardiac function, while alterations in DNA methylation of candidate genes were used to index pro-inflammatory modifications. In the PM expose group, autonomic analysis revealed a significant decrease of 2UV%, index of parasympathetic modulation (14% vs 9%, p = 0.0309), while DNA analysis showed a significant increase of interferon $\gamma$ (IFN- $\gamma$) methylation, from T1 to T3. In a mixed model using T1, T2 and T3, fine and ultrafine PM fractions showed significant associations with IFN- $\gamma$ methylation and parasympathetic modulation.
Conclusions
Our study shows, for the first time, that in healthy subjects, acute exposure to PM affects parasympathetic control of heart function and it increases methylation of a pro-inflammatory gene (i.e. methylation of interferon $\gamma$). Thus, our study suggests that, even in absence of other co-factors and in otherwise healthy individuals, PM per se is sufficient to trigger parasympathetic dysautonomia, independently from changes in sympathetic control, and inflammation, in a dose-dependent manner.},

Since such information is lacking for the State of Kuwait, this study examined the exposure levels of PM2.5 and the associated health risk as evaluated by five mortality measures embodied in ischemic heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute lower respiratory infection as well as two morbidity outcomes related to both cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The measurement models utilized in this investigation followed the WHO guidelines. Over a span of a four-year period (2014–2017), the annual PM2.5 concentration levels ranged from 38.0 $\mu$g/m3 to 75.2 $\mu$g/m3. In general, exposure levels tended to fluctuate throughout the day with the higher levels recorded during rush hours (early morning and early evening), weekends (particularly Saturdays), and summer (i.e., August and September). The highest number of excess cases and attributable proportions of premature mortalities were related to ischemic heart disease and stroke at 352 (95% CI 275–426) and 70.8% (95% CI 39.7–85.2), respectively. In general, respiratory diseases showed a higher number of excess cases and attributable proportions than cardiovascular diseases. Relative to other findings on the global stage, the results emanating from Kuwait are emerging on the higher side. The study outcomes suggest that control strategies are in dire need to bend the pollution levels in Kuwait.},

The citywide air pollution controlling measures during the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou provided such an opportunity to answer this question. We collected daily data on the concentrations of air pollutants and mortality from ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, and compared them for 51 intervention days in 2010 with the corresponding days in 2006–2009 and 2011 (reference period). Poisson-based interrupted time series analysis was employed to estimate the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The daily mean concentrations of PM10 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 $\mu$m) was 88.64 $\mu$g/m3 during the reference period, and 80.47 $\mu$g/m3 during the intervention period. Daily mortality number of total stroke, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke decreased from 3.67, 2.00 and 1.67 during the reference period, to 3.00, 1.76 and 1.24 during the intervention period; the corresponding RR was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.66–0.94), 0.87 (95% CI: 0.69–1.11) and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.52–0.91), respectively.

abstract = {Aim
To assess the main and interaction effects of black carbon and physical activity on arterial blood pressure in a healthy adult population from three European cities using objective personal measurements over short-term (hours and days) and long-term exposure.
Methods
A panel study of 122 healthy adults was performed in three European cities (Antwerp, Barcelona, and London). In 3 seasons between March 2015 and March 2016, each participant wore sensors for one week to objectively measure their exposure to black carbon and monitor their physical activity continuously. Blood pressure was assessed three times during the week: at the beginning (day 0), in the middle (day 4), and at the end (day 7). Associations of black carbon and physical activity with blood pressure and their interactions were investigated with linear regression models and multiplicative interaction terms, adjusting for all the potential confounders.
Results
In multiple exposure models, we did not see any effects of black carbon on blood pressure but did see effects on systolic blood pressure of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity effect that were statistically significant from 1 h to 8 h after exposure and for long-term exposure. For a 1METhour increase of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, the difference in the expected mean systolic blood pressure varied from −1.46 mmHg (95%CI -2.11, −0.80) for 1 h mean exposure, to −0.29 mmHg (95%CI -0.55, −0.03) for 8 h mean exposure, and −0.05 mmHg (95%CI -0.09, −0.00) for long-term exposure. There were little to no interaction effects.
Conclusions
Results from this study provide evidence that short-term and long-term exposure to moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is associated with a decrease in systolic blood pressure levels. We did not find evidence for a consistent main effect of black carbon on blood pressure, nor any interaction between black carbon and physical activity levels.},

abstract = {Objectives
Evaluate the relationship between arthritis diagnosis in those over 50 and exposure to extreme air pollution in utero or infancy (<1 year of age).
Methods
Compare rates of arthritis diagnosis between groups that experienced differential air pollution exposure in early-life due to quasi-random variation in birth location and date relative to the 1952 Great Smog in London. We use regression-estimated difference-in-differences analyses based on English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) data.
Results
In the 2816 respondent sample, aged 51–62, the arthritis diagnosis rate is 22.8%, with 16.4% reporting osteoarthritis and 4.6% reporting rheumatoid arthritis. We estimate that exposure to the Great Smog in infancy increases the arthritis diagnosis rate by 23.4 percentage points (95% CI: 1.97 to 44.8). Decomposing these results by type of arthritis reveals that the rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis rate increases due to infant exposure are larger and more significant than those for osteoarthritis: 14.9 percentage points (95% CI: 0.495 to 29.4) versus 9.5 percentage points (95% CI: −11.9 to 30.8). In utero exposure is not associated with significant increases in arthritis diagnosis rates.
Conclusions
Our results are the first to link early-life air pollution exposure to later-life arthritis diagnoses, and suggest a particularly strong link for RA. These findings are consistent with those of shorter-term, correlational studies, and indicate that health effects of air pollution exposure can span decades and extend beyond cardiopulmonary systems.},

abstract = {Aims
As a top ambient pollutant in urban area, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been associated with the occurrence and deterioration of many medical conditions, while limited studies have observed the association with psychiatric conditions. This study aimed to investigate the association between short-term PM2.5 exposure and psychiatric emergency events, and further explored the variation by age, sex and seasonal patterns, which have been suggested to be associated with both psychiatric risk and pollutant toxicity.
Methods
We used time-series analysis to investigate the association between short-term exposure of PM2.5 and emergency ambulance dispatches for psychiatric emergencies (EPE) (n = 158634) in Beijing, one of the top polluted cities in China during the study period between 2008 and 2014. Stratified analyses were conducted to examine the effects of age, sex and seasonal pattern.
Results
Every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase of the PM2.5 concentration was associated with a 0.12% increase of the same-day overall EPE (95% CI: 0.03–0.22%, p = 0.013) and a 0.12% increase of the suicide-related EPE at lag 2 (95%CI: 0.01–0.24%, p = 0.041). The associations remained when adjusted for sunlight duration. An age effect was observed where children (age <18) showed a higher risk of suicide-related EPE after PM2.5 exposure compared to adults (18 ≤ age≤64). We did not observe evidence of effect modification by sex and season based on the results of stratified analysis.
Conclusions
We found a positive association between acute PM2.5 exposure and increased psychiatric emergency presentations indicated by emergency ambulance dispatches data. Children were more vulnerable and might develop psychiatric problems including those leading to suicide. Public awareness of the health risks of PM2.5 is important to strengthen current efforts to reduce emissions.},

We investigated all-cause non-accidental daily mortality and its association with fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and the Air Quality Index (AQI) from March 2011 through March 2014 in the megacity of Tehran, Iran. Generalized additive quasi-Poisson models were used within a distributed lag linear modeling framework to estimate the cumulative effects of PM2.5, NO2, and the AQI up to a lag of 45 days. We further conducted multi-pollutant models and also stratified the analyses by sex, age group, and season. The relative risk (95% confidence interval (CI)) for all seasons, both sexes and all ages at lag 0 for PM2.5, NO2, and AQI were 1.004 (1.001, 1.007), 1.003 (0.999, 1.007), and 1.004 (1.001, 1.007), respectively, per inter-quartile range (IQR) increment (18.8 $\mu$g/m3 for PM2.5, 12.6 ppb for NO2, and 31.5 for AQI). In multi-pollutant models, the PM2.5 associations were almost independent from NO2. However, the RRs for NO2 were slightly attenuated after adjustment for PM2.5 but they were still largely independent from PM2.5. The cumulative relative risks (95% CI) per IQR increment reached maximum during the cooler months, including: 1.13 (1.06, 1.20) for PM2.5 at lag 0–31 (for females, all ages); 1.17 (1.10, 1.25) for NO2 at lag 0–45 (for males, all ages); and 1.13 (1.07, 1.20) for the AQI at lag 0–30 (for females, all ages). Generally, the RRs were slightly larger for NO2 than PM2.5 and AQI. We found somewhat larger RRs in females, age group >65 years of age, and in cooler months. In summary, positive associations were found in most models. This is the first study to report short-term associations between all-cause non-accidental mortality and ambient PM2.5 and NO2 in Iran.},

While air pollution has been associated with depression and anxiety in adults, its impact on childhood mental health is understudied.
Objective
We examined lifetime exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) and symptoms of depression and anxiety at age 12 years in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study cohort.
Methods
We estimated exposure to elemental carbon attributable to traffic (ECAT), a surrogate of diesel exhaust, at birth, age 12 years, and average exposure throughout childhood, using a validated land use regression model. We assessed depression and anxiety at age 12 years by parent report with the Behavior Assessment System for Children-2, and by child report with the Child Depression Inventory-2 (CDI-2) and the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS). Associations between TRAP at birth, age 12 years, and childhood average and mental health outcomes were estimated using linear regression models adjusting for covariates including parent depression, secondhand smoke exposure, race, household income, and others.
Results
Exposure to ECAT was not significantly associated with parent-reported depression or anxiety. However, exposure to ECAT at birth was associated with increased child-reported depression and anxiety. Each 0.25 µg/m3 increase in ECAT was associated with a 3.5 point increase (95% CI 1.6–5.5) in CDI-2 scores and 2.3 point increase (95% CI 0.8–3.9) in SCAS total anxiety scores. We observed similar associations between average childhood ECAT exposures but not for concurrent exposures at age 12.
Conclusions
TRAP exposure during early life and across childhood was significantly associated with self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms in children. The negative impact of air pollution on mental health previously reported among adults may also be present during childhood.},

abstract = {Background
Previous studies have mainly focused on the associations between particulate matters and infant mortality. However, evidence regarding the associations between gaseous pollutants and mortality among children aged <5 years remains sparse.
Objectives
The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between ambient air pollution and death among children aged <5 years in Beijing, China, and explore the impact of age, gender and specific causes of death on these associations.
Methods
Concentrations of ambient air pollution and the number of deaths among children aged <5 years in Beijing from January 2014 to September 2016 were extracted from authoritative electronic databases. The associations were estimated for a single-month lag from the current month up to the previous 5 months (lag0-lag5) and moving averages of the current and previous months (lag01-lag05) using generalized additive Poisson regression (adjusted for time trends, season, meteorological variables and holidays). Subgroup analyses related to age, gender and specific diseases were performed. Two-pollutant models were used to evaluate the possible role of single pollutants.
Results
Sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) demonstrated the strongest associations with death among children aged <5 years at lag0, and the estimates decreased or even turned negative with the increasing lag periods. For an interquartile range increase in SO2, NO2 and CO at lag0, the odds ratios (OR) were 1.332 (95% CI 1.152-1.539), 1.383 (95% CI 1.113-1.718) and 1.273 (95% CI 1.028-1.575). However, CO lost significance after adjusting for SO2 and NO2, and PM2.5 gained significance (OR 1.548, 95% CI 1.061-2.258) after adjusting for PM10. The ORs for SO2 and NO2 remained the most stable across all two-pollutant models. The associations for children aged 1–5 years were stronger than those reported for infants at lag0 but lower at the other lag months. The pollutant associations were stronger for congenital heart disease-related death than overall and pneumonia-related death. We did not find significant differences in terms of gender.
Conclusion
Exposure to air pollution may increase the incidence of death among children aged <5 years. SO2 and NO2 may be the most stable pollutants reflecting associations between air pollution and death, deserving further attention. Children with congenital heart diseases are more susceptible to air pollution. Therefore, it is urgent to implement the clean air targets established by WHO and reduce the exposure of children to air pollution.},

abstract = {Introduction
The association between ambient air pollution and length of hospital stay (LOS) for children with lower-respiratory infection is unclear.
Materials and methods
The association was examined using admission data for 75,432 children in Hanoi, aged 0–5 years, hospitalized with acute lower-respiratory infection (ALRI) and daily air pollutant levels in Hanoi between 2007 and 2016. We estimated the odds ratio of being discharged for an interquartile range (IQR) increment (IQR) of ambient pollutants during one to four days prior to admission date. We used pooled logistic regression models including a B-spline function of calendar time and terms describing the baseline odds, adjusting for meteorological factors, age, gender, residential location, week-day of admission, discharge on weekends or holidays, and number of respiratory hospitalizations one day prior to the discharge date.
Results
An IQR increase in O3 concentrations (85.8 $\mu$g/m3) was associated with a 5% (95%CI: 2%–8%) decrease in the odds of discharge from hospital among children with ALRI. Results were similar for PM10, but only for children aged 2–5 years. For the other pollutants, corresponding associations were close to null or in the opposite direction. For example, increase in CO was associated with shorter LOS.
Conclusions
Our study provides the first investigation of the associations between lengths of hospital stays and air pollutant levels prior to hospitalization in Asian children. Increased levels of O3 prior to admission predicted prolonged hospitalizations. The inconsistencies in the findings for other pollutants call for further investigations.},

abstract = {Background
A growing body of research has examined relationships between neighborhood characteristics and exposure to air toxics in the United States. However, a limited number of studies have addressed neighborhood isolation, a measure of spatial segregation. We investigated the spatial distribution of carcinogenic air toxics in the St. Louis metropolitan area and tested the hypothesis that neighborhood isolation and sociodemographic characteristics are associated with exposure to carcinogenic air toxics.
Methods
We obtained lifetime air toxics cancer risk data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's National Air Toxic Assessment and sociodemographic data from the American Community Survey. We used geographic information systems to identify statistically significant clusters of census tracts with elevated all-site cancer risk due to air toxics in the St. Louis metropolitan area. Relative Risks (RR) were estimated for the association between neighborhood characteristics and air toxic hot spots. Using a local spatial isolation index to evaluate residential segregation, we also evaluated the association between neighborhood racial and economic isolation and air toxic hot spots.
Results
Approximately 14% (85 of the 615) of census tracts had elevated cancer risk due to air toxics (p < 0.01). These air toxic hot spots were independently associated with neighborhoods with high levels of poverty and unemployment and low levels of education. Census tracts with the highest levels of both racial isolation of Blacks and economic isolation of poverty were more likely to be located in air toxic hotspots than those with low combined racial and economic isolation (RR = 5.34; 95% CI = 3.10–9.22).
Conclusions

The mean daily concentrations of PM2.5 were 142.14 ± 65.98 $\mu$g m−3 and 218.36 ± 85.22 $\mu$g m−3 for spring and winter, respectively, which were 4.1 and 6.2 times greater than the limit value (35 $\mu$g m−3) set by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China (CMEP). Among the studied PTEs, Zn, Pb and Mn were the dominant elements, followed by, Cr, Cu, Ni, Cd, and As. The concentrations of Cr in spring and winter and Cd in winter were much higher than the corresponding standards values. The results of the principal component analysis for the PM2.5-bound PTEs identified that coal combustion and soil/road dust as major sources in spring and winter, respectively. Exposure to Cr and Pb exhibited potential carcinogenic risks to children and adults. The values of non-carcinogenic risks posed by Cr (via ingestion), Pb and Mn (via inhalation), and Pb (via dermal exposure) for children as well as Mn via inhalation for adults exceeded the reference marker of 1.},

abstract = {Background
New evidence suggests that particulate matter less than 2.5 $\mu$m in diameter (PM2.5) is associated with late-onset dementia (LOD). However, epidemiological studies for the entire population are lacking.
Methods
We analyzed approximately 94 million follow-up records from fee-for-service Medicare records for 13 million Medicare beneficiaries residing in the southeastern United States (U.S.) from 2000 to 2013. We used spatially and temporally continuous PM2.5 exposure data. To account for time-varying PM2.5 levels, we applied an Andersen-Gill counting process proportional hazard model; we stratified our analyses by subtype of dementia and level of urbanization of residence.
Results
During a median follow-up of 6 years, 1,409,599 hospitalizations with dementia occurred. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of hospitalization with dementia was 1.049 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.048 to 1.051) per 1 $\mu$g/m3 increase in annual PM2.5. The hazard ratio for vascular dementia was higher (HR, 1.086; 95% CI, 1.082 to 1.090). In large, the magnitude of the effect grew as the level of urbanization increased (HR, 1.036; 95% CI, 1.031 to 1.041 in rural areas versus HR, 1.052; 95% CI, 1.050 to 1.054 in metropolitan areas).
Conclusions
Long-term exposure to higher PM2.5 was associated with increased hospitalizations with dementia.},

abstract = {Air pollution is one of the leading preventable threats to public health. Emerging evidence indicates that exposure to environmental stressors is associated with abnormal foetal development. However, how prenatal exposure to diesel exhaust PM2.5 (DEP) predisposes adult offspring to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains unclear. To examine this, C57BL/6J mice were exposed to DEP or a vehicle before conception and during pregnancy and fed normal chow or a high-fat diet. Then, the hepatic fatty accumulation in the adult male offspring and possible molecular mechanisms were assessed. Our data showed that prenatal exposure to DEP on normal chow led to hepatic steatosis in adult male offspring with normal liver function. However, prenatal DEP exposure relieved the hepatic steatosis and liver function in offspring of mice fed a high-fat diet. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to DEP on normal chow increased lipogenesis and worsened fatty acid oxidation. The counteractive effect of prenatal DEP exposure on high-fat-diet-induced hepatic steatosis was produced through upregulated adenosine 5′-monophosphate-activated protein kinase, and this improved lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation. Collectively, prenatal exposure to DEP programmed the development of NAFLD differently in the adult male offspring of mice fed normal chow and a high-fat diet, showing the pleotrophic effects of exposure to adverse environmental factors in early life.},

abstract = {Few studies have evaluated the morbidity burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) due to coarse particulate matter (PMC, particles with an aerodynamic diameter between 2.5 and 10 $\mu$m) pollution, especially in a multi-city setting. This study aimed to investigate the short-term impacts of PMC on hospital admissions (HAs) for total and cause-specific CVDs in 18 cities of Sichuan Province, Southwestern China during 2015–2016, and calculate the corresponding attributable risks. First, generalized additive model (GAM) was employed to estimate the city-specific associations of PMC with CVDs hospitalizations, and then combined the results from the single cities to obtain the pooled effects at the regional level. Age-, sex- and season-specific analyses were also performed. We further estimated the burden of HAs for CVDs attributable to PMC exposure. A total of 621,835 HAs for CVDs were collected during the study period. We found that PMC was significantly associated with elevated risks of CVDs hospitalizations. Per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PMC corresponded to an increase of 1.18% (95% CI: 0.67%–1.68%) in daily HAs for CVDs. For specific subtypes of CVDs, significant associations of PMC with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure and ischemic stroke were observed. The effect estimates of PMC remained robust after adjusting for PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 $\mu$m) and gaseous pollutants in co-pollutant models. The pernicious effects were found to be stronger in the elderly and in the warm season. Overall, about 1.26% (95% CI: 0.73%–1.79%) of HAs for CVDs could be attributable to PMC exposure, corresponding to 7863 (95% CI: 4554–11110) attributable CVDs HAs. Our findings suggest that PMC might result in increased risk of HAs for CVDs in Sichuan Province, Southwestern China, and should be considered in the prevention and control of CVDs.},

abstract = {Emerging researches found that air pollution had some effects on childhood allergic rhinitis, but the associations between gestational and early life exposure to air pollution and childhood allergic rhinitis are unclear. This study aimed to analyze the association between gestational and early life exposure to air pollutants and childhood allergic rhinitis. There are 3165 preschool children from Wuhan and Ezhou during November to December 2017. Parents or guardians reported information on childhood allergic rhinitis, lifestyle, the health status of children and family members. The concentration of NO2, PM2.5, and PM10(2011–2016) were estimated by a spatiotemporal model with satellite remote sensing and land use information. We used binary logistic regression models to estimate adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for 1 $\mu$g/m3 of increase in each air pollutant during pregnancy and early life. We found that 639 (20.2%) children were diagnosed as allergic rhinitis among 3165 children. After adjusting for covariates, exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and the first year of life were significantly associated with childhood allergic rhinitis. Excessive exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 both increased the prevalence of childhood allergic rhinitis during pregnancy (PM2.5: aOR = 1.232, 95%CI: 1.201–1.263; PM10: aOR = 1.063, 95%CI: 1.052–1.075) and in the first year of life (PM2.5: aOR = 1.032, 95%CI: 1.006–1.059; PM10: aOR = 1.018, 95%CI: 1.005–1.031). The relationship of exposure to NO2 and childhood allergic rhinitis was only significant for exposure during the first year of life (aOR = 1.013, 95%CI: 1.002–1.025). In summary, our findings suggested that gestational and early life exposure to air pollution is a risk factor for childhood allergic rhinitis.},

In the first full month, continuous daily PM1 was collected on the roof of the Engineering Building at Jilin Jianzhu University in Changchun city. Water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs) were measured by ion chromatography, inorganic elements were gained by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and organic and elemental carbon were tested by an organic carbon (OC)/elemental carbon (EC) analyzer (DRI model 2001A). The concentrations of PM1 ranged from 15.1 to 128.52 $\mu$g/m3, with an average of 40.2 $\mu$g/m3. Concentrations of 15 elements were determined in this period, which contributed 5.21%–31.23% of PM1. We used Igeo values to determine the contamination levels of elements including the carcinogenic elements As, Cd, Ni, and Pb. The results show that the values of elements, such as As, Cd, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sn, Co, and Zn, are >5, indicating extreme contamination. WSIIs account for 50.81% of PM1, and the values were lower in the pre-SF period and higher post-SF. The concentrations of NO3− and SO42− were the two highest with constant ratios over the whole period, indicating the consumption of coal and gasoline. The K+ value can reflect the fireworks emissions. Besides elements and WSIIs, carbon species account for 28.48% of PM1 on average. A higher ratio between OC and EC revealed a small percentage of vehicles and a high contribution of coal and biomass consumption. Elements can affect the body via three routes: oral, respiratory, and dermal. According to average daily dose (ADD) calculations, ADD values of the ingestion pathway were two or four times greater than those of the other two routes. Moreover, the exposure of all three pathways in children was greater than in adults. The excess cancer risk (ECR) of Pb, Ni, As, Cd, and Cr was beyond the safety limit (10−6 to 10−4), indicating cancer risk in both adults and children. This study provides detailed composition data and the first report on FW particles during the SF period and their potential impact on human health in Changchun city.},

We reviewed the mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, perfluoroalkyl substances, phthalates, and environmental tobacco smoke in pervious based on birth cohort studies in Asia. The aim of this study was to summarize the traditional environmental pollution and the target subjects were also based on the birth cohort in Asia area. Environmental pollutants included air pollutants, pesticides focusing on organochlorine pesticides, diakylphosphates, and pyrethroid, and heavy metals including lead, arsenic, cadmium, manganese, vanadium, and thallium. Fetal growth and pregnancy outcomes, childhood growth and obesity, neurodevelopment and behavioral problems, and allergic disease and immune function were classified to elucidate the children's health effects. In total, 106 studies were selected in this study. The evidences showed air pollution or pesticides may affect growth during infancy or childhood, and associated with neurodevelopmental or behavioral problems. Prenatal exposure to lead or manganese was associated with neurodevelopmental or behavioral problems, while exposure to arsenic or cadmium may influence fetal growth. In addition to the harmonization and international collaboration of birth cohorts in Asia; however, understand the whole picture of exposure scenario and consider more discipline in the research are necessary.},

abstract = {The knowledge of the underlying mechanisms by which particulate matter (PM) exerts its health effects is still incomplete since it may trigger various symptoms as some persons may be more susceptible than others. Detailed studies realized in more relevant in vitro models are highly needed. Healthy normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE), asthma-diseased human bronchial epithelial (DHBE), and COPD-DHBE cells, differentiated at the air-liquid interface, were acutely or repeatedly exposed to fine (i.e., PM2.5-0.18, also called FP) and quasi-ultrafine (i.e., PM0.18, also called UFP) particles. Immunofluorescence labelling of pan-cytokeratin, MUC5AC, and ZO-1 confirmed their specific cell-types. Baselines of the inflammatory mediators secreted by all the cells were quite similar. Slight changes of TNF$\alpha$, IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF, MCP-1, and/or TGF$\alpha$, and of H3K9 histone acetylation supported a higher inflammatory response of asthma- and especially COPD-DHBE cells, after exposure to FP and especially UFP. At baseline, 35 differentially expressed genes (DEG) in asthma-DHBE, and 23 DEG in COPD-DHBE, compared to NHBE cells, were reported. They were involved in biological processes implicated in the development of asthma and COPD diseases, such as cellular process (e.g., PLA2G4C, NLRP1, S100A5, MUC1), biological regulation (e.g., CCNE1), developmental process (e.g., WNT10B), and cell component organization and synthesis (e.g., KRT34, COL6A1, COL6A2). In all the FP or UFP-exposed cell models, DEG were also functionally annotated to the chemical metabolic process (e.g., CYP1A1, CYP1B1, CYP1A2) and inflammatory response (e.g., EREG). Another DEG, FGF-1, was only down-regulated in asthma and specially COPD-DHBE cells repeatedly exposed. While RAB37 could help to counteract the down-regulation of FGF-1 in asthma-DHBE cells, the deregulation of FGR, WNT7B, VIPR1, and PPARGC1A could dramatically contribute to make it worse in COPD-DHBE cells. Taken together, these data contributed to support the highest effects of UFP versus FP and highest sensitivity of asthma- and notably COPD-DHBE versus NHBE cells.},

Ambient air pollution is one potential contributor to vision impairments, but few epidemiological studies have demonstrated such an association. This cross-sectional survey collected the information of 33,626 subjects aged ≥50 years in six developing countries during 2007–2010. Myopia was identified based on questions related to symptoms of myopia. The annual concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) were estimated with the satellite data and chemical transport model. We examined the associations between the two pollutants and myopia using mixed-effect Poisson regression models with robust variance estimation (sandwich estimation). We observed J-shaped associations between the two pollutants and myopia, and identified 12 and 54 $\mu$g/m3 as the threshold concentrations. The adjusted prevalence ratio was 1.12 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.21) and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.38) for each standard deviation (SD) increase in PM2.5 and O3 concentrations above their threshold, respectively. In addition, the interaction analysis suggested a synergistic interaction of these two pollutants on myopia in the additive model, with a synergistic index of 1.81 (Bootstrapping 95% CI: 0.92, 4.94). Our results indicate that long-term exposures to PM2.5 and O3 might be important environmental risk factors of myopia in the elderly, and suggest that more efforts should be taken to reduce airborne PM2.5 and O3 levels to protect vision health.},

We considered five scenarios related to PM2.5 levels: an increase to 35 $\mu$g/m3; a reduction to 25 $\mu$g/m3; a reduction to 15 $\mu$g/m3; a reduction to 10 $\mu$g/m3 (the WHO's air quality guideline value); and a full roll-back, assuming a reduction to 2.4 $\mu$g/m3. All scenarios used 2017 p.m.2.5 levels as a starting point. Using the concentration response function of the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM), we estimated a total of 7146 (95% CI: 6596–7513) adult (age ≥25 years) deaths attributable to PM2.5 in 2017. The leading causes of death were ischemic heart disease (3437; 95% CI: 3315–3516), stroke (886; 95% CI: 693–1002), lower respiratory infections (531: 95% CI: 414–589), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (364; 95% CI: 271–420), and lung cancer (274; 95% CI: 236–298).

In contrast, lung cancer mortality was only significantly associated with SO2 level. Subgroup analyses showed that female in respiratory disease patients were more sensitive to air pollution than male. Studies about seasonality of pollutants on respiratory and lung cancer mortality were inconsistent. Further analyses with multiple-pollutant model showed that the effects of pollutants were generally decreased after the other pollutants were adjusted, except the effects of SO2 on lung cancer. These findings demonstrated that air pollution could evidently increase the respiratory disease and lung cancer mortality.},

Heart rate (HR), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Diastolic blood pressure (DBP), White Blood Cell (WBC), Red Blood Cell (RBC), hematocrit (HCT), and hemoglobin (HB) are some biomarkers of oxidative stress and systemic inflammation related to CVD. However, study about effects of air pollution on biomarkers of CVD in specific group remains very limited. We conducted this study to measure the association between ambient air pollution and biomarkers of CVD in adult people in the urban area of northern Taiwan. We conducted this study using a cross-sectional design. We extracted biomarkers of CVD data from the daily hospital admissions of pulmonary department of Shuang-Ho Hospital in New Taipei City from 2014 to 2015. We averaged the 24 h concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and SO2, and 8 h concentrations of O3 from the database of Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Network. We analyzed the data using multiple linear regression. We used lag up to 5 previous days in the analysis to measure the delay effect of the air pollution. We controlled meteorological variables (temperature and relative humidity) and individual characteristics (sex, age, smoking status, and alcohol consumption) in the analysis. We use the beta coefficients ($\beta$) and 95% CI to express the association. We considered P-value < 0.05 as statistically significant. We found statistically significant positive associations between air pollutants and HR, SBP, and RBC concentrations and statistically significant negative associations between air pollutants and HCT concentrations. On the other hand, we found no significant association between air pollutants and DBP, WBC, and HB concentration.},

abstract = {Background
We evaluated the short-term effect of mixtures of ambient air pollutants on respiratory and circulatory morbidity in four Colombian cities.
Methods
Daily Emergency Department (ED) visit records for respiratory and circulatory selected diagnosis and daily concentrations for six criteria air pollutant were obtained in four of the five major cities in Colombia: Bucaramanga, Bogota, Cali, and Medellin during 2011–2014. Using conditional Poisson time series analysis with fixed effects, we assessed the effect of air pollutants on health outcomes using single-pollutant, two-pollutant and specific mixtures-of-pollutant models controlling for meteorology and time trends. The percentages of change in the rate of ED visits and their 95% confidence interval were estimated for the joint effect of pollutants.
Results
In single-pollutant models increases in gases concentrations were associated with increases in ED visits for respiratory and circulatory diseases. The two-pollutant models for respiratory diseases showed that the effect of NO2 alone (% change 2.86 95% CI 1.87–3.85) is higher than the joint effect of any of its combinations except for its combination with SO2 (% change 3.05 95%CI 1.04–5.05). The two-pollutant models for circulatory diseases showed synergistic effects between NO2 and PM2.5 (% change 2.13 95%CI 0.001–4.26). Specific mixtures models showed that the mixture of “traffic-related pollutants” has the higher joint effect on circulatory morbidity and respiratory morbidity.
Conclusions
The results show the dominant effect of NO2 in air pollution mixtures on respiratory and circulatory morbidity, and the synergistic effect of NO2 and SO2 in air pollution mixtures on respiratory morbidity.},

abstract = {Rationale
Long-term exposure to air pollution has been associated with increased lung cancer incidence and mortality. However, the short-term association between air pollution and lung cancer mortality (LCM) remains largely unknown.
Methods
We collected daily data on particulate matter with diameter <2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), particulate matter with diameter < 10 $\mu$m (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3), and LCM in three of the biggest cities in China, i.e. Beijing, Chongqing, and Guangzhou, from 2013 to 2015. We first estimated city-specific relationships between air pollutants and LCM using time-series generalized linear models, adjusting for potential confounders. A classification and regression tree (CART) model was used to stratify LCM risk based on combinations of air pollutants and meteorological factors in each city. Then we pooled the city-specific associations using random-effects meta-analysis. Meta regression was used to explore if city-specific characteristics modified the air pollution-LCM association. Finally, we stratified the analyses by season, age, and sex.
Results
Over the entire period, the current-day concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 in Chongqing and PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 in Guangzhou were positively associated with LCM (Excess risk ranged from 0.72% (95% CI 0.27%–1.17%) to 6.06% (95% CI 0.76%–11.64%) with each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increment in different pollutants), but the association between current-day air pollution and LCM in Beijing was not significant (P > 0.05). When considering the environmental and weather factors simultaneously, current-day PM2.5, relative humidity, and PM10 were the most important factors associated with LCM in Beijing, Chongqing, and Guangzhou, respectively. LCM risk related with daily PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 significantly increased with the increasing annual mean temperature and humidity of the city, while LCM risk related with daily O3 significantly increased with the increases of latitude, annual mean O3 concentration, and socioeconomic level. After stratification, the current-day PM2.5, PM10, and O3 during the warm season in Beijing and PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 during the cool season in Chongqing and Guangzhou were positively associated with LCM (Excess risk ranged from 0.93% (95% CI 0.42%–1.45%) to 7.16% (95% CI 0.64%–14.09%) with each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increment in different pollutants). Male and the elderly lung cancer patients were more sensitive to the short-term effect of air pollution.
Conclusions
Lung cancer patients should enhance protection measures against air pollution. More attentions should be paid for the high PM2.5, PM10, and O3 during the warm season in Beijing, and high PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 during the cool season in Chongqing and Guangzhou.},

Microbial genome DNA was extracted from throat swab samples to study the oral flora composition of the volunteers by amplifying and sequencing the V3 regions of prokaryotic 16S rRNA. Lung function tests were also performed. The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria were significantly lower and Firmicutes Proteonacteria and Actinobacteria higher in participants from polluted regions. Within bacteria classes, Bacterioida abundance was lower and Clostridia abundance higher in polluted areas, which was also reflected in the order of abundance. In samples from region C, the abundance of Prevotellaceae, Veillonellaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, Fusobacteriaceae Paraprevollaceae and Flavobacteriaceae were lowest among the 3 regions studied, whereas the abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae were the highest. From group A to group C, the relative class abundances of Prevotella, Veillonella, Fusobacterium, Camphylobacter and Capnocytophaga Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus and Moraxella became lower in polluted areas. Pulmonary function correlated with air pollution and the oropharyngeal microbiota differed within regions of high, medium and low air pollution. Thus, during the winter heating period in Northeast China, the imbalance of the oropharyngeal microbiota might be caused by air pollution and is likely associated with impairment of lung function in young people.},

Previous studies investigated interaction between the two variables; however, the excess death risk due to the synergic effect (i.e. interaction on the additive scale) between the two variables has not been investigated adequately on a multi-country scale. This study aimed to assess the excess death risk due to the synergism between high temperature and air pollution on mortality using a multicity time-series analysis. We collected time-series data on mortality, weather variables, and four air pollutants (PM10, O3, NO2, and CO) for 16 metropolitan cities of three countries (Japan, Korea, and Taiwan) in Northeast Asia (1979–2015). Quasi-Poisson time-series regression and meta-analysis were used to estimate the additive interaction between high temperature and air pollution. The additive interaction was measured by relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) index. We calculated RERI with relative risks (RR) of the 99th/10th, 90th/90th, and 99th/90th percentiles of temperature/air pollution metrics, where risk at the 90th/10th percentiles of temperature/air pollution metrics was the reference category. This study showed that there may exist positive and significant excess death risks due to the synergism between high temperature and air pollution in the total population for all pollutants (95% lower confidence intervals of all RERIs>0 or near 0). In final, we measured quantitatively the excess death risks due to synergic effect between high temperature and air pollution, and the synergism should be considered in public health interventions and a composite warning system.},

abstract = {Due to its twofold effects on climate change and air quality, black carbon (BC) is of wide concern in the atmospheric sciences. Considerable uncertainty exists as to the health effects of atmospheric BC for the limited epidemiological and toxicological studies. As combustion-derived BC is one important component of PM2.5 (particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 $\mu$m), the question remains of whether or not BC may play an important role in PM2.5-related health risks. To quantitatively analyze the short-term health effects of BC and PM2.5, a confounder-adjusted semi-parametric generalized additive model (GAM) of a time series study was used to calculate the concentration-response relationship between BC and PM2.5 and daily cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality from 2006 to 2011 in Beijing. During the study period, the mean daily concentrations of BC and PM2.5 were 6.8 $\mu$g/m3 and 75.9 $\mu$g/m3, respectively. The results showed that BC was significantly associated with CVD mortality, and an interquartile range (IQR) increase in BC (5.7 $\mu$g/m3) and PM2.5 (64. 5 $\mu$g/m3) were associated with 2.70% (95% CI: 2.20, 3.21) and 4.06% (95% CI: 3.47, 4.65) increase in CVD mortality. The health risk associated with BC may less than that of PM2.5. When adjusted for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), the effects of BC remained statistically significant. It showed the relatively difference between BC and PM2.5 when it comes to the modification effects of age, gender and educational attainment. These findings provide valuable evidence to the rare studies of the concentration-response relationship of BC with human health in developing countries.},

abstract = {Background
Ambient particulate matter (PM) has been linked to adverse health outcomes, but evidence is still relatively limited for emergency department visits (EDVs). Most prior studies used daily mean PM as exposure assessment regardless of within-day variations, which might underestimate the potential acute health effects. In this study, we evaluated the hourly associations between PM and EDVs, so as to further understand the very short-term impacts of PM on EDVs.
Methods
Hourly data for all-cause EDVs, air pollutants and meteorological factors were collected from Shenzhen, China, between March 1, 2015 and February 28, 2018. A time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the hourly associations between PM and EDVs, adjusting for hourly mean temperature and relative humidity. Subgroup analyses stratified by gender, age and clinic department were conducted to identify vulnerable populations. We further classified the whole year into warm (April to September) and cold (October to March of the next year) months to evaluate seasonal effect modification.
Results
Hourly mean all-cause EDVs peaked at 9 a.m. and 7 p.m., while PM2.5 and PM10 peaked at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. The hourly associations between PM and EDVs appeared immediately and persisted for about 10 hours. All-cause EDVs increased 0.72% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.33, 1.12) and 0.72% (95% CI: 0.45, 0.99) associated with per 10 $\mu$g/m3 rise in PM2.5 and PM10 at lag 0–10 h, respectively. Stronger effects of PM2.5 and PM10 on EDVs were observed among younger groups (age <35 years). Significant PM-EDVs associations were only identified in cold season. A 10 $\mu$g/m3 rise in PM2.5 along 0–10 h, for instance, was associated with increased all-cause EDVs risks of 1.13% (95% CI: 0.67, 1.60) in cold season and −0.23% (95% CI: −1.00, 0.53) in warm season, respectively.
Conclusions
Our study provided hourly perspective for the short-term associations between PM exposure and increased EDVs. The adverse impacts of PM on EDVs were only identified in cold season, and young people suffered more from both PM2.5 and PM10 exposures. These findings may have valuable implications for public policy promotion on air cleaning, as well as hospital management in optimizing allocation of resources on PM-sensitive conditions.},

According to the WHO, low birth weight (<2500 gr) is a primary maternal health indicator as the cause of multiple morbi-mortality in the short and long-term. It is known that air pollution from road traffic (PM10, NO2) and O3 have an important impact on low birth weight (LBW), but there are few studies of this topic in Spain. The objective of this study is to determine the possible exposure windows in the gestational period in which there is greater susceptibility to urban air pollution and to quantify the relative risks (RR) and population attributable risks (PAR) of low birth weight associated with pollutant concentrations in Spain.
Methods
We calculated the weekly average births with low birth weight (ICD-10: P07.0-P07.1) for each Spanish province for the period 2001–2009, using the average weekly concentrations of PM10, NO2 and O3, measured in the capital cities of the provinces. The estimation of RR and PAR were carried out using generalized linear models with link Poisson, controlling for the trend, seasonality and auto-regressive character of the series and for the influence of temperature during periods of heat waves and/or cold. Finally, a meta-analysis was used to estimate the global RR and PAR based on the RR obtained for each of the provinces.
Results
The RR for the whole of Spain is 1.104 (CI95%: 1.072, 1.138) for the association between LBW and PM10, and 1.091 (CI95%: 1.059, 1.124) for the association between NO2 and LBW. Our results suggest that 5% of low birth weight births in the case of PM10 and 8% in the case of NO2 could have been avoided with a reduction of 10 $\mu$g/m3 in the concentrations of these pollutants.
Conclusions
The impact of the results obtained- with 6105 cases attributable to PM10 and up to 9385 cases attributable to NO2 in a period of 9 study years- suggest the need to design structural and awareness public health measures to reduce air pollution in Spain.},

In the present study, street dust and suspended dust were collected from the city and county of Asaluyeh, Iran. Samples were characterized by various microscopic techniques (fluorescence, polarized light, SEM) in order to quantify and classify MPs and microrubbers (MRs) in the urban and industrial environments that are potentially ingestible or inhalable by humans. In < 5-mm street dust retrieved from 15 sites, there were an average of 900 MPs and 250 MRs per 15 g of sample, with MPs exhibiting a range of colours and sizes (<100 to >1000 $\mu$m). Most street dust samples were dominated by spherical and film-like particles and MRs largely made up of different sizes of black fragments and fibrous particulates. Airborne dust collected daily over an eight-day period at two locations revealed the ubiquity of fibrous MPs of sizes ranging from about 2 $\mu$m to 100 $\mu$m and an abundance of about 1 per m−3. These samples contained small MR fragments whose precise characteristics were more difficult to define. Based on the median concentrations in street dust, estimates of acute exposure through ingestion are about 5 and 15 MP d−1 and 2 and 7 MR d−1 for construction workers and young children, respectively. Quantities of inhalable particulates were more difficult to define but the potential toxicity of MPs and MRs taken in by this route was evaluated from assays performed using particulates isolated from street dusts in the presence of an artificial lung fluid. Both types of particle exhibited oxidative potential, with MPs displaying consumptions of different antioxidants that were comparable with corresponding values for a reference urban particulate dust but lower than those for London ambient particulate matter. Thus, MPs and MRs contribute towards the health impacts of urban and industrial dusts but their precise roles remain unclear and warrant further study.},

Many cities in China are currently experiencing severe air pollution due to modernization. Previous studies investigating the effects of air pollutants exposure were particularly conducted in severe air polluted area and studies in low pollution areas were sparse.
Methods
To quantitatively assess the short-term effects of ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O3) on outpatient visits in low pollution area, we conducted a time-series analysis from Jan 1, 2015 to Dec 31, 2016 in Shennongjia, China. Generalized additive model (GAM) was used to evaluate the influence of PM2.5 on daily hospital outpatient visits with different lag structures. We also conducted stratified analysis to explore the association between PM2.5 concentration and outpatient visits in different seasons.
Results
In the present study, per IQR increment of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO and O3 were related with 1.92% (0.76%–3.09%), 1.92% (0.77%–3.07%), 2.74% (95% CI: 1.65%–3.83%), 1.89% (95% CI: 0.68%–3.10%) and 2.30% (95% CI: 0.65%–3.95%) increase on respiratory outpatient visits. Significant associations were found between PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and respiratory outpatient visits at lag0:1, lag0:2 days. The effects of PM2.5 were more evident in the cool season than in the warm season.
Conclusions
Our study showed that short-term exposures to PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO and O3 were related with increased risk of outpatient visits of respiratory diseases, and highlighted the adverse effect of air pollutants exposure, especially PM2.5 exposure in cool season on health in low pollution area.},

Extensive studies have linked ambient particulate matter (PM) to an increased mortality burden from a wide range of causes. However, the effects of PM on mortality rates from specific causes were unclear. This study aimed to estimate the detrimental effects of PM on cause specific deaths in Changzhou, China.
Method
Data representing daily mortality rates, weather conditions and particulate air pollution levels were obtained from government-controlled agencies of Changzhou, from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016. An inverse distance weighting method was used to assess the population exposure to PM and a time-series was performed to detect the detrimental effects of PM.
Results
Positive associations were identified between PMs and daily mortality rates from non-accidental, circulatory, hypertensive, respiratory and chronic lower respiratory causes at a lag of 0–3 days. The effects of PMs were strongest on hypertensive mortality, with an increase of 5.27% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.43–8.19%) and 3.52% (95% CI: 1.55–5.53%), per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increment in PM2.5 and PM10 respectively. The elderly exhibited a higher mortality risk with PMs exposure. Females were more vulnerable to circulatory, hypertensive and respiratory death while males were more sensitive to chronic lower respiratory and neurodegenerative mortality. The effects were stronger in warm seasons for circulatory mortality and stronger in cold seasons for respiratory mortality.
Conclusion
These findings indicate that PM could exert adverse influences on the outcomes of several pathological processes, especially for women and the elderly with hypertension disease.},

Using linked data from birth certificates, hospital discharge diagnoses, and air pollution estimates informed by the New York City Community Air Survey, we fit conditional logistic regression models to evaluate the association between residential levels of PM2.5 and NO2 with risk of GDM among 256,372 singleton live births of non-smoking mothers in New York City born 2008–2010, adjusting for sociodemographic factors and stratified on zip code of maternal address.
Results
GDM was identified in 17,065 women, yielding a risk of GDM in the study sample of 67 per 1000 deliveries. In single pollutant models, 1st and 2nd trimester PM2.5 was associated with a lower and higher risk of GDM, respectively. In models mutually adjusting for PM2.5 levels in both trimesters, GDM was associated with PM2.5 levels in the 2nd trimester (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.10 per interquartile range increase in PM2.5), but not the 1st trimester (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.02). Conversely, GDM was associated with NO2 during the 1st trimester (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.09), but not the 2nd trimester (OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.06). The positive associations between pollutants and GDM were robust to different model specifications. PM2.5 in the 2nd trimester was more strongly associated with GDM among mothers who were aged <35 years and not Medicaid recipients. NO2 in the 1st trimester was more strongly associated with GDM among overweight and parous women.
Conclusions
In this large cohort of singleton births in New York City, NO2 in the 1st trimester and PM2.5 in the 2nd trimester were associated with higher odds of GDM, while 1st trimester PM2.5 was weakly and inconsistently associated with lower odds of GDM.},

The degree to which air pollution contributes to the increase in the burden of CVD in Pakistan has not been assessed due to lack of data. This study aims to describe the characteristics of PM2.5 constituents and investigate the impact of individual PM2.5 constituent on cardiovascular morbidity in Karachi, a mega city in Pakistan. Daily levels of twenty-one constituents of PM2.5 were analyzed using samples collected at two sites from fall 2008 to summer 2009 in Karachi. Hospital admission and emergency room visits due to CVD were collected from two large hospitals. Negative Binominal Regression was used to estimate associations between pollutants and the risk of CVD. All PM2.5 constituents were assessed in single-pollutant models and selected constituents were assessed in multi-pollutant models adjusting for PM2.5 mass and gaseous pollutants. The most common CVD subtypes among our participants were ischemic heart disease, hypertension, heart failure, and cardiomyopathy. Extremely high levels of PM2.5 constituents from fossil-fuels combustion and industrial emissions were observed, with notable peaks in winter. The most consistent associations were found between exposure to nickel (5–14% increase per interquartile range) and cardiovascular hospital admissions. Suggestive evidence was also observed for associations between cardiovascular hospital admissions and Al, Fe, Ti, and nitrate. Our findings suggested that PM2.5 generated from fossil-fuels combustion and road dust resuspension were associated with the increased risk of CVD in Pakistan.},

abstract = {Air pollution is associated with adverse effects on brain health including cognitive decline, dementia, anxiety, depression, and suicide. While toxicological studies have demonstrated the potential for repeated or chronic pollutant exposure to lead to disease states, characterisation of initial biological responses to exposure is needed to better understand underlying mechanisms. The brain is highly sensitive to glucocorticoids (primarily cortisol in humans, corticosterone in rodents), stress hormones that play important roles in cognition and mental health. We tested whether glucocorticoids could be implicated in central nervous system (CNS) effects of pollutant exposure by examining glucocorticoid-dependent signaling across brain regions after exposure to the common pollutant ozone. Male Fischer-344 rats were exposed for 4 h to air or 0.8 ppm ozone ± metyrapone (50 mg/kg), a drug that blocks corticosterone synthesis (n = 5/group). Key glucocorticoid-responsive genes (serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase, SGK; glucocorticoid-inducible leucine zipper, GILZ), and a gene responsive to both glucocorticoids and oxidative stress (metallothionein (MT)-1), were increased by ozone in all brain regions (olfactory bulb, frontal lobe, cortex, midbrain, hippocampus, cerebellum, brainstem), correlating with plasma corticosterone levels. Metyrapone prevented the increase in SGK and GILZ, and reduced but did not eliminate the effect on MT-1, suggesting glucocorticoid-dependent and –independent regulation. Administering exogenous corticosterone (10 mg/kg) to air-exposed rats reproduced the ozone effects, confirming specificity. The results demonstrate that early pollutant effects include stress hormone-dependent signaling. As both ozone and particulate matter activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and elevated glucocorticoids are implicated in brain pathologies, stress hormones could contribute to CNS impacts of air pollutants.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) has been linked with diabetes and elevated blood glucose in adults. However, there are few reports on the effects of PM on fasting blood glucose (FBG) among children.
Objectives
The study aimed to assess the associations between medium-term exposure of ambient particles with diameters ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), and ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10) and FBG in a general population of children, and also to explore the modifying effects of diet.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 4234 children (aged 6–13 years) residing in Guangzhou, China, in 2017. Individual PM2.5 and PM10 exposures during the 186-day period before each physical examination were retrospectively estimated by an inverse distance weighting interpolation and time-weighted approach according to their home address, school address, and activity patterns. Linear mixed effect models were used to examine the relationships between PM2.5 and PM10 with FBG after adjusting for covariates.
Results
We found that per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 and PM10 levels during the 186-day period were associated with 2.3% (95% CI: 1.0%, 3.8%) higher FBG and 0.9% (95% CI: 0.5%, 1.4%) higher FBG, respectively. Stronger effect estimates were observed among subgroups of children with a family history of diabetes, and higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). Also, we found significant interactions between PM2.5 concentration and family history of diabetes and SSBs intake on FBG.
Conclusions
Medium-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 and PM10 were associated with higher FBG levels in children, and that higher SSBs intake might modify these associations.},

We aimed (1) to estimate national and provincial long-term exposure of Iranians to ambient particulate matter (PM) < 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) from 1990 to 2016, and (2) to estimate the national and provincial burden of disease attributable to PM2.5 in Iran. We used all available ground measurements of PM < 10 $\mu$m (PM10) (used to estimate PM2.5) from 91 monitoring stations. We estimated the annual mean exposure to PM2.5 for all Iranian population from 1990 to 2016 through a multi-stage modeling process. By applying comparative risk assessment methodology and using life table for years of life lost (YLL), we estimated the mortality and YLL attributable to PM2.5 for five outcomes. The predicted provincial annual mean PM2.5 concentrations range was between 21.7 $\mu$g/m3 (UI: 19.03–24.9) and 35.4 $\mu$g/m3 (UI: 31.4–39.4) from 1990 to 2016. We estimated in 2016, about 41,000 deaths (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 35634, 47014) and about 3,000,000 YLL (95% UI: 2632101, 3389342) attributable to the long-term exposure to PM2.5 in Iran. Ischemic heart disease was the leading cause of mortality by 31,363 deaths (95% UI: 27520, 35258), followed by stroke (7012 (5999, 8062) deaths), lower respiratory infection (1210 (912, 1519) deaths), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1019 (715, 1328) deaths), and lung cancer (668 (489, 848) deaths). In 2016, about 43% of all PM2.5 related mortality in Iran was, respectively, in the following provinces: Tehran (12.6%), Isfahan (9.3%), Khorasan Razavi (8.0%), Fars (6.5%), and Khozestan (6.4%). In summary, we found that the majority of Iranians were exposed to the levels of ambient particulate matter exceeding the WHO guidelines from 1990 to 2016. Further, we found that there was an increasing trend of total mortality attributed to PM2.5 in Iran from 1990 to 2016 where the slope was higher in western provinces.},

There is some evidence that prenatal exposure to low-level air pollution increases the risk of preterm birth (PTB), but little is known about synergistic effects of different pollutants.
Objectives
We assessed the independent and joint effects of prenatal exposure to air pollution during the entire duration of pregnancy.
Methods
The study population consisted of the 2568 members of the Espoo Cohort Study, born between 1984 and 1990, and living in the City of Espoo, Finland. We assessed individual-level prenatal exposure to ambient air pollutants of interest at all the residential addresses from conception to birth. The pollutant concentrations were estimated both by using regional-to-city-scale dispersion modelling and land-use regression–based method. We applied Poisson regression analysis to estimate the adjusted risk ratios (RRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) by comparing the risk of PTB among babies with the highest quartile (Q4) of exposure during the entire duration of pregnancy with those with the lower exposure quartiles (Q1-Q3). We adjusted for season of birth, maternal age, sex of the baby, family's socioeconomic status, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal exposure to environmental tobacco smoke during pregnancy, single parenthood, and exposure to other air pollutants (only in multi-pollutant models) in the analysis.
Results
In a multi-pollutant model estimating the effects of exposure during entire pregnancy, the adjusted RR was 1.37 (95% CI: 0.85, 2.23) for PM2.5 and 1.64 (95% CI: 1.15, 2.35) for O3. The joint effect of PM2.5 and O3 was substantially higher, an adjusted RR of 3.63 (95% CI: 2.16, 6.10), than what would have been expected from their independent effects (0.99 for PM2.5 and 1.34 for O3). The relative risk due to interaction (RERI) was 2.30 (95% CI: 0.95, 4.57).
Discussion
Our results strengthen the evidence that exposure to fairly low-level air pollution during pregnancy increases the risk of PTB. We provide novel observations indicating that individual air pollutants such as PM2.5 and O3 may act synergistically potentiating each other's adverse effects.},

abstract = {Rapid industrialization and urbanization have resulted in widespread pollution of airborne particulate matter (PM) containing various heavy metals with adverse human-health effects. Health risk assessment of PM calls for accurate evaluation of the bioaccessibility, instead of the total content, of heavy metals in PM. Here, we demonstrated that the leachable fraction of particle-bound As, Pb, Cr, Mn, Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn in lung fluid within the typical retention duration of particles in human lungs varied drastically among particles originated from different air pollution sources, including coal combustion, biomass combustion, fugitive dust, road dust, construction dust, cement and soil. Moreover, bioaccessibility of heavy metals, particularly in biomass combustion, cement and soil particles, was strongly dependent on pollution sources, and the particulate Cu, Ni, Pb and Cd appeared to be the primary indicators of the source dependence of heavy metal bioaccessibility. Using total rather than bioaccessible concentrations of particle-bound heavy metals not only led to overestimation of the health risk of source particles, but more importantly, inaccurate identification of the high-risk pollution sources and the priority metal pollutants in the source particles. When considering bioaccessibility of particle-bound heavy metals examined in this study, coal combustion products exhibited the highest carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic risks among all source particles, whereas cement particles would be the source with highest risk based on total metal content. As and Mn appeared to be the main drivers for the noncarcinogenic risks of source particles, while As, Ni and Cr were the major contributors to the carcinogenic risks of source particles, significantly different from those based on total contents. This research underlines the importance of incorporating bioaccessibility into health risk indexes of frequently occurring particle-bound heavy metals from specific air pollution sources, which will facilitate risk-based assessment of source contribution and hence effective source regulation of airborne PM.},

Background
Prenatal exposure to air pollutants has been suggested as a possible etiologic factor for the occurrence of ADHD or ADHD-like behaviors. But we still lack a comprehensive assessment of household air pollutants exposure on the development of ADHD-like behaviors during childhood.
Object
We aimed to assess whether prenatal household inhalants exposure is associated with preschoolers' ADHD-like behaviors in a nonclinical population.
Methods
This study used the baseline data of the Longhua Child Cohort Study. During 2015–2017, we recruited 42,983 mothers and their kindergarten-aged children who enrolled at kindergarten in the Longhua district of Shenzhen, to obtain the demographic data and relevant exposure information through self-administrated questionnaire survey. The source of prenatal household inhalants exposure include cooking fumes, environmental tobacco smoke, mosqutio coils, home renovated and indoor burning incense. Logistic and censored least absolute deviations (CLAD) models were used to reveal the association between prenatal exposure to household air pollutants and hyperactive behaviors in child.
Results
We found that exposure to five types of household inhalants during pregnancy were independently associated with an increased risk of child hyperactive behaviors. Moreover, we observed a significant interaction between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and cooking fumes during gestation on child hyperactive behaviors in CLAD models. We also found a significant joint effect between burning mosquito coils and incense during gestation for child hyperactive behaviors risk both in CLAD and Logistic models. Furthermore, a household inhalants exposure index was used to demonstrate a dose-response relationship between the cumulative effect of exposure to the five household air pollutants and child hyperactivity.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that prenatal exposure to different household inhalants might increase the risk of children's hyperactive behaviors at around 3 years of age with the presence of interaction effects between some inhalants.},

PM2.5 exposure samples were collected by personal monitors during worker' day-shift working time (9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.), and particulate heavy metals were analyzed by ICP-MS. Urinary 8-OHdG concentrations were analyzed in pre- and post-work urine samples from selected subjects to reflect their oxidative stress (OS) level variation. Results showed that PM2.5 average exposure concentration was 230.73 ± 142.99 $\mu$g m−3. Pb, Zn and Cr were the most abundant elements of metals, accounting for over 70% of total particulate heavy metals. Values based on geoaccumulation index (Igeo) and enrichment factor (EF) analysis indicated that heavy metals including Pb, As, Cd, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn were mainly derived from anthropogenic sources, presenting heavily pollution levels. Health assessment was conducted using integrated toxicity values and Monte Carlo simulation, and results indicated that exposure to PM2.5-bound heavy metals can trigger significant adverse non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk. Urinary 8-OHdG concentrations of participants elevated over 2 times after their day-shift working exposure, indicating that pollutants from vehicle emission could cause DNA damage for highway toll station workers. However, we did not find significant association between fine particle-bound heavy metals and urinary 8-OHdG levels. Much work should be conducted in the future study focusing on confounding factors.},

abstract = {Many cities fail to meet air quality standards, which results in increased risk for pulmonary disorders, including asthma. Human and experimental studies have shown that diesel exhaust (DE) particles are associated with worsening of allergic asthma. Biodiesel (BD), a cleaner fuel from renewable sources, was introduced in the eighties. Because of the reduction in particulate matter (PM) emissions, BD was expected to cause fewer adverse pulmonary effects. However, only limited data on the effect of BD emissions in asthma are available.
Objective
Determine whether BD exhaust exposure in allergic sensitized mice leads to different effects on inflammatory and functional responses compared to DE exposure.
Methods
Balb/C mice were orotracheally sensitized with House Dust Mite (HDM) or a saline solution with 3 weekly instillations. From day 9 until day 17 after sensitization, they were exposed daily to filtered air (FA), DE and BD exhaust (concentration: 600 $\mu$g/m3 PM2.5). Lung function, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cell counts, cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-17, TNF-$\alpha$, TSLP) in the BALF, peribronchiolar eosinophils and parenchymal macrophages were measured.
Results
HDM-sensitized animals presented increased lung elastance (p = 0.046), IgG1 serum levels (p = 0.029), peribronchiolar eosinophils (p = 0.028), BALF levels of total cells (p = 0.020), eosinophils (p = 0.028), IL-5 levels (p = 0.002) and TSLP levels (p = 0.046) in BALF. DE exposure alone increased lung elastance (p = 0.000) and BALF IL-4 levels (p = 0.045), whereas BD exposure alone increased BALF TSLP levels (p = 0.004). BD exposure did not influence any parameters after HDM challenge, while DE exposed animals presented increased BALF levels of total cells (p = 0.019), lymphocytes (p = 0.000), neutrophils (p = 0.040), macrophages (p = 0.034), BALF IL-4 levels (p = 0.028), and macrophagic inflammation in the lung tissue (p = 0.037), as well as decreased IgG1 (p = 0.046) and IgG2 (p = 0.043) levels when compared to the HDM group.
Conclusion
The results indicate more adverse pulmonary effects of DE compared to BD exposure in allergic sensitized animals.},

abstract = {Background
Air pollution affects the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal tract and has been linked to several gastrointestinal diseases in recent years. However, little is known about the association of air pollution with peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB). We aimed to conduct a time-series study to examine the association between short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and emergency admissions for PUB in Beijing, China.
Methods
Data on emergency admissions for PUB between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2012 were obtained from the Beijing Medical Claim Data for Employees. Measurements of PM2.5 concentration were obtained from the United States Embassy air-monitoring station. A generalized additive Poisson model was applied to explore the association between PM2.5 concentrations and emergency admissions for PUB, with stratification by gender and age.
Results
A total of 5123 emergency admissions for PUB were identified. Short-term exposure to outdoor PM2.5 was significantly associated with increased emergency admissions for PUB at lag0 day. A 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration at lag0 day corresponded to a 0.56% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04%–1.08%; P = 0.035) increase in emergency admissions for PUB. There was a clear concentration-response association between PM2.5 concentrations and emergency admissions for PUB. The PM2.5 effect estimates were greater in elderly people (≥65 years old) with the difference approaching statistical significance (percentage change 0.78, 95% CI 0.03%–1.54% in patients ≥65 years old; percentage change 0.32, 95% CI -0.38%–1.03% in patients <65 years old; P = 0.073), but the difference between men and women was not significant (percentage change 0.75, 95% CI 0.08%–1.43% in man; percentage change 0.27, 95% CI -0.51%–1.07% in woman; P = 0.368).
Conclusion
Short-term elevation in outdoor PM2.5 concentrations was associated with increased emergency admissions for PUB, particularly in elderly people. Future studies are warranted to confirm the findings and elucidate the mechanisms underlying the association.},

abstract = {Verona is an Italian city which experiences low levels of air quality due to its location near the centre of the Po Valley, one of the most polluted areas in Italy and in Europe. High pollutant concentrations, in particular of fine aerosol particles, are associated with detrimental effects on human health. The present study analyses the ground-based measurements of particulate matter with a diameter ≤2.5$\mu$m (PM2.5) and ≤10$\mu$m (PM10) registered in Verona and its province since 2002 to 2015. The annual means and the number of days when the European standards were exceeded show that air quality has slightly improved in the analysed period, with statistically significant negative trends present in both PM10 and PM2.5 levels. The annual mortality due to different diseases attributable to PM2.5 has been estimated for the period 2009–2014 by employing concentration-response functions based on epidemiological cohort studies. Results show that, on average, about 299 deaths per year (3 are infants) are caused by PM2.5 related diseases in Verona province. Among these, about 88 deaths per year (1 is infant) occur in Verona municipality. This means that 11.3% of the total deaths due to diseases of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems is attributable to long-term exposure to PM2.5 pollution.},

abstract = {The associations of particulate matter (PM) pollution with the morbidity of overall and subtypes of mental disorders (MDs), as well as the corresponding morbidity burden, remain understudied, especially in developing countries. This study aimed to evaluate the short-term effects of PM2.5 (diameters ≤ 2.5 µm), PM10 (diameters ≤ 10 µm) and PMC (diameters between 2.5 and 10 µm) on hospital admissions (HAs) for MDs in Chengdu, China, during 2015–2016, and calculate corresponding attributable risks. A generalized additive model (GAM) with controlling for time trend, meteorological conditions, holidays and day of the week was used to estimate the associations. Stratified analyses were also performed by age, gender and season. We further estimated the burden of HAs for MDs attributable to PM exposure. During the study period, a total of 10,947 HAs for MDs were collected. PM2.5, PM10 and PMC were significantly associated with elevated risks of MDs hospitalizations. Each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5, PM10 and PMC at lag06 corresponded to an increase of 2.89% (95% CI: 0.75–5.08%), 1.91% (95% CI: 0.57–3.28%) and 3.95% (95% CI: 0.84–7.15%) in daily HAs for MDs, respectively. The risk estimates of PM on MDs hospitalizations were generally robust after adjustment for gaseous pollutants in two-pollutant models. We found stronger associations between PM pollution and MDs in males and in cool seasons than in females and in warm seasons. For specific subtypes of MDs, significant associations of PM pollution with dementia,schizophrenia and depression were observed. Using WHO's air quality guidelines as the reference concentrations, 9.53% (95% CI: 2.67–15.58%), 9.17% (95% CI: 2.91–14.70%) and 6.10% (95% CI: 1.40–10.32%) of HAs for MDs could be attributable to PM2.5, PM10 and PMC, respectively. Our results suggested that PM exposure might be an important trigger of hospitalizations for MDs in Chengdu, China, and account for substantial morbidity burden.},

Health risk assessment (HRA) was computed using Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) for evaluating inhalation lifetime cancer risk (LTCR), the hazard quotient (HQ), and sensitivity analysis (SA) for BTEX exposure in different age groups (birth to <81) and as a function of distance (0–250 m) from the center of the stations. For all monitoring stations, the average values of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene in winter were 466.09 ± 132.25, 873.13 ± 233.51, 493.05 ± 141.22, and 910.57 ± 145.40 $\mu$g m−3, respectively. The mean wintertime ratios of T/B for the 12 stations ranged from 1.69 to 2.04. Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between the concentration of BTEX with either the specific month or distance from the center of stations (p > 0.05). Factors promoting BTEX formation in the study region were fuel evaporation and gas/CNG station emissions. The LTCRs for the target compounds in the winter for different age groups and distances from the center of stations was limited to 2.11 × 10−4 to 1.82 × 10−3 and 2.30 × 10−4 to 2.01 × 10−3, respectively, which exceeded proposed values by U.S. EPA. Moreover, the HQs for BTEX for three age groups and distances were limited to between 2.89 × 10−5 and 9.33 × 10−2, which were lower than the acceptable limit (HQs < 1). The results of this work are applicable to similar areas that are heavily populated with vehicular traffic. This study motivates a closer look at mitigation strategies to limit the health effects of carcinogenic emissions such as benzene and ethylbenzene from gas/CNG stations.},

The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the effects of TRAP exposure, specifically particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), during outdoor exercise on cardio-respiratory health effects. Systematic database searches of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Medline were performed by two researchers to identify peer-reviewed studies from 2000 to 2018. Combinations of keywords related to cardio-respiratory health effects, physical exercise and ambient air pollution were used. Thirteen studies were included, originating predominantly from European countries but also the American. They suggested that exercising in an environment with high TRAP exposure increases markers of respiratory and systemic inflammation, as well as, impairs the vascular function and increases artery pressure, when compared with an environment with low-TRAP exposure. In addition, the smaller particles appear to have the most severe health consequences compared with the larger coarse particles and NO2. This study also provides evidence that specific groups of the population have enhanced susceptibility to adverse effects from particulate matter exposure while exercising. There is a need for more studies focused on the relationship between air pollution, physical exercise and health, as large societal benefits can be obtained from healthy environments that can promote outdoor physical exercise.},

abstract = {Background
An initial epidemiological study carried out 18 years ago in Marseilles indicated that the air quality in schools was poor and that there was an association between the level of fine particulates and the occurrence of asthma in children. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the change in the prevalence of childhood asthma and allergic diseases and their link with the levels of air pollutants and other factors of potential risk.
Methods
In 2016, using a questionnaire identical to the one used for the 1st survey in 1998–1999, we collected information regarding the symptoms, the diagnosis, and the potential confounding factors. We measured the main indoor and outdoor pollutants at the schools.
Results
Overall, the prevalence of asthma and of allergic diseases exhibited an increasing trend in the time interval between the two studies, significant only for dry cough and pollen allergy. The level of air pollutants decreased significantly indoors. In spite of this, we found a correlation and a dose-effect relationship between the level of PM2.5 and the prevalence of asthma. A family history of asthma and allergies, the insalubrity of the place of residence, and a non-Mediterranean diet were also associated with the risk of these diseases.
Conclusion
In the time interval between the two studies, which were 18 years apart, despite a reduction in the level of air pollutants in classrooms, asthma was still related to PM2.5. Other potentially causative or contributing environmental factors were also related to asthma and allergies.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic emissions in the Asia-Pacific region have changed rapidly in recent years due to increasing industrialization and mobility, as well as the implementation of emission abatement controls. These changes are likely to have affected the region's burden of premature mortalities associated with exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5). However, the contribution of each sector and effectiveness of different policy measures has not yet been quantified. As such, this study estimates changes in regional anthropogenic emissions by sector between 2010 and 2015. These changes are combined with an existing high-resolution emissions inventory to estimate emissions for the year 2015. Using a chemistry-transport model, we then estimate (i) the total contribution of each sector to premature mortality in 2015; and (ii) the effects of changes in each sector's contribution to total PM2.5-driven premature mortalities between 2010 and 2015. We estimate that globally, 2,030,000 (95% CI: 1,770,000 to 2,280,000) PM2.5-driven premature mortalities are attributable to anthropogenic emissions in 2015 in Asia-Pacific with the top three sources being the agricultural, industrial, and residential sectors. Between 2010 and 2015, excluding the effects of changes in population distribution or other social factors, sustained growth in economic activity led to an estimated 99,000 (95% CI: 81,000 to 130,000) additional premature mortalities annually, primarily across India, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. Simultaneously, changes such as electrification of railroads and newly-introduced abatement measures, e.g. China's Action Plan on the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution, region-wide adoption of Euro IV/V/VI-compliant road vehicles, and implementation of fuel quality standards, resulted in an estimated total reduction of 76,000 (95% CI: 65,000 to 100,000) annual premature mortalities, primarily across East Asia, including China and Japan. These opposing drivers add to a net change of an additional 22,000 (95% CI: 12,000 to 33,000) PM2.5-driven annual premature mortalities between 2010 and 2015 associated with anthropogenic combustion emissions in Asia-Pacific.},

In this study, we constructed a real-ambient PM exposure system to investigate multi-organ injury and the reversibility of the impairments in C57BL/6 J male mice exposed to PM with a duration of up to three months in Shijiazhuang, a city with the highest PM2.5 concentration in China. This unique exposure system provided an optimal scenario for round-the-clock PM exposure absent a change in the physiochemical properties of PM and minimized the disturbance to the mice habitat. The mean concentration of PM2.5 in the exposure chambers was 89.95, 79.98, and 87.87 $\mu$g/m3 at three different time points, respectively: weeks 1–3, week 1–6, and week 1–12. The injury in multiple organs, including lung, brain, heart, testis, and intestine, was profound and was evident by the significant pathological and functional alterations. Pulmonary pathological examination revealed severe interstitial inflammatory and alveolar hemorrhage throughout the exposure, which was in line with the reduced lung function and the increased cytokine excretion in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood plasma. Notably, the PM-mediated inflammatory response in different systems was correlated with the severity of the injury and the attenuation of pulmonary lesions in the recovery group. Thus, the PM2.5-induced inflammatory response, the chemical components-induced cytotoxicity, genetic damage, and oxidative stress might be implicated in the impairment of multiple murine organs. These findings revealed the severity, sensitivity, and reversibility of multi-organ injury in response to a real-ambient PM exposure.},

abstract = {Fenhe Plain is a typical region polluted combinedly by coal combustion and coking activities with serious air pollution problem, especially in winter. In order to clarify the size distribution and health risk of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in winter of the Fenhe Plain, the respirable aerosol particles (PM10) were collected by cascade impactor, and 17 PAHs were analyzed. The results showed that the average mass concentration of PM10-bound PAHs was 689.19 ng/m3, which was higher than that in many other domestic and overseas cities. The particulate PAHs mainly distributed in the <0.95 $\mu$m size range, accounting for more than 60% of the total. Under the combined influence of local emissions, low temperature, low intensity of solar radiation, dry atmosphere and Kelvin effect, naphthalene (Nap) displayed a bimodal distribution, while the rest of the 17 PAHs all followed a nearly unimodal size distribution. Wind and humidity were important factors which could influence the size distribution of PAHs. Coefficient of divergence (CD) analysis showed that PAHs between all of the sizes had a high spatial heterogeneity in source factor contributions, although diagnostic ratio indicated similar sources among them. Health risk assessment found that the lifetime cancer risk of exposure to particulate PAHs was 1693.76 parts per million people. Ultrafine particles (<0.95 $\mu$m) predominated the total carcinogenicity of the particulate PAHs, while benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), dibenzo(a,h)anthracene (DahA), benzo(b)fluoranthene (BbF), benzo(a)anthracene (BaA), benzo(k)fluoranthene (BkF) and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene (IcdP) were the major carcinogenic components. Traffic exhausts contributed most to the carcinogenic PAHs, followed by coal combustion and coking. Our study can provide reference for the pollution control and residential health protection in Fenhe Plain, and bring more reasonable parameterizations to the estimation of PAHs outflow from this key region to other international regions.},

abstract = {Although a few studies have identified positive association between green space and reduced mortality rate, the effect modification of green space for the impact of air pollution on health outcomes is under studied. We quantified whether green space modifies associations between short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5) and hospitalization across 364 urban U.S. counties for 2000–2013. Green space was measured by normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Daily number of hospital admissions for cardiovascular or respiratory diseases from Medicare enrollees (≥65yrs) and air quality monitoring data for each county were used to assess risks, as percent change in hospitalization related to 10$\mu$g/m3 increase in particulate matter. We computed an absolute change in county-specific relative risks explained by difference in county-level NDVI. The study results found that the association between air pollution and health was less in areas with more green space. We estimated that an interquartile range increase in NDVI corresponds to a 1.68% (95% CI: 0.43, 2.91) decrease in the association between PM10 and cardiovascular hospitalization and 10.40% (95% CI: 7.34, 13.34) decrease in the PM10-hospitalization association of acute myocardial infarction. For hospitalization associated with PM2.5, a 0.18% (95% CI: −0.39, 0.73) absolute decrease in relative risk was found for cardiovascular hospitalizations. In results stratified by age, younger age groups (65–74, 75–84yrs) had larger reductions for the PM10-hospitalization association with increase in NDVI than older populations (≥85yrs) but not for the PM2.5-hospitalization association. These findings add evidence for health benefits of green space in diminishing the health impacts of particulate matters on hospitalizations for older populations in the U.S.},

This study examined the effects of short-term exposure to PM2.5 on emergency admissions to the hospital for mental disease in Seoul, Korea. Data regarding 80,634 emergency admissions for mental diseases were collected from a nationally centralized healthcare claims database in Seoul during 2003–2013. Generalized linear models with climate variables were used to examine associations between short-term PM2.5 exposure and mental disease admissions. To comprehensively assess PM2.5 effects, we used single- and two-pollutant models, which considered other pollutants in combination with PM2.5. The relative risk (RR) of emergency admissions for mental disease was 1.008 (95% confidence interval, 1.001–1.015) for each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in 2-day average PM2.5 concentration. This effect persisted or became slightly stronger in the two-pollutant models that included carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, or sulfur dioxide (RR, 1.01–1.021), but association appeared to be limited to individuals < 65 years of age. Significant association was estimated only during the warm season (RR, 1.021–1.023) in the two-pollutant models. The exposure–response curve was steeper at lower concentrations, suggesting that the risk of mental disease at lower concentrations of pm2.5 (0–30 µg/m3). PM2.5 was associated with increased admissions even when it was below the World Health Organization's Air Quality Guidelines (25 $\mu$g/m3), but the association was not statistically significant. Thus, based on the data from a large database, exposure to PM2.5 was associated with increases in emergency admissions for mental diseases, and this association was significant during the warm season. PM2.5 may even affect mental disease at levels below the current air quality guidelines. These results provide substantial insight regarding the effects of air pollutants and have important implications for policy makers.},

Few studies have investigated respiratory effects of particulate matter air pollution using a full range of particle size distribution.
Objectives
To explore the short-term associations between size-fractionated particle number concentration (PNC) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality.
Methods
We conducted a time-series study to explore the associations between size-fractionated PNC and daily COPD mortality in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, China, from 2014 to 2016. We evaluated particle size distribution from 0.01 $\mu$m to 10 $\mu$m, which was segregated into 7 ranges to better explore the size-dependent associations. We used over-dispersed generalized additive models to estimate the associations after controlling for time trends, temperature, humidity, day of the week and holidays.
Results
A total of 5430 deaths due to COPD were identified during the study period. For size ranges from 2.5 – 10 $\mu$m, 1–2.5 $\mu$m to 0.3–1 $\mu$m, there were stronger associations between PNC and COPD mortality, but the associations were statistically insignificant. However, for the smaller size ranges from 0.3 to 0.01 $\mu$m, the associations became statistically significant and the magnitude of association remained stable. An interquartile range increase in PNC at lag 0–1 day for size ranges 0.01–0.03 $\mu$m, 0.03–0.05 $\mu$m, 0.05–0.1 $\mu$m and 0.1–0.3 $\mu$m was associated with increments of 4.44% (95% CI: 1.16%, 7.73%), 4.31% (95% CI: 1.16%, 7.47%), 4.22% (95% CI: 1.05%, 7.40%), and 4.28% (95% CI: 0.48%, 8.09%) in COPD mortality, respectively.
Conclusion
This study suggested that particles below 0.3 $\mu$m in diameter might be mainly responsible for the adverse effect of particulate air pollution on CDPD mortality in Shanghai, China.},

The relationship between maternal exposure to air pollution and birth outcomes is not well characterised where ambient air pollution is relatively low.
Objectives
We aimed to explore the association between maternal exposure to ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and a range of birth outcomes in Victoria, Australia. Secondary aims were to explore whether obstetric conditions, such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, were effect modifiers in observed relationships.
Methods
We included all singleton births occurring in Victoria, Australia from 1st March 2012 to 31st December 2015 using routinely collected government data. Outcomes included birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), term low birth weight (tLBW), large for gestational age (LGA), and spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB). We estimated exposure to annual ambient NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations, assigned to maternal residence at time of birth. Confounders included maternal, meteorological and temporal variables. Multivariable linear regression and log-binomial regression were used for continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively.
Results
There were 285,594 births during the study period. Average NO2 exposure was 6.0 parts per billion (ppb, median 5.6; interquartile range (IQR) 3.9) and PM2.5 was 6.9 $\mu$g/m3 (median 7.1, IQR 1.3). IQR increases in ambient NO2 and PM2.5 were associated with fetal growth restriction, including decrements in birth weight (NO2 $\beta$ −22.8 g; 95%CI -26.0, −19.7; PM2.5 $\beta$ −14.8 g; 95%CI -17.4, −12.2) and increased risk of SGA (NO2 RR 1.08; 95%CI 1.06, 1.10; PM2.5 RR 1.05; 95%CI 1.04, 1.07) and tLBW (NO2 RR 1.06; 95%CI 1.01, 1.10; PM2.5 RR 1.04; 95%CI 1.03, 1.08). Women with GDM and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy had greater decrements in birth weight in association with pollutant exposure.
Discussion
In this exploratory study using an annual metric of exposure, maternal exposure to low-level ambient air pollution was associated with fetal growth restriction, which carries substantial public health implications.},

abstract = {Background
Studies on the hypertensive effect of long-term air pollution exposure were inconclusive and showed scarce evidence from rural areas in developing countries. In this context, we examined the associations of air pollution exposure with hypertension and blood pressure, and their effect modifiers in rural Chinese adults.
Methods
We studied 39,259 participants from a cohort established in five rural regions of central China. Individual exposures to PM2.5 and PM10 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 $\mu$m and 10 $\mu$m) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was evaluated using satellite-based spatiotemporal models. Mixed-effect regression models were applied to examine the associations of long-term exposure to air pollution with hypertension and four blood pressure component measurements, including systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure (PP). Several potential effect modifiers related to demographic and behavioral factors were also examined.
Results
The results showed that for each 1 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5, PM10 and NO2, the adjusted odds ratio of hypertension was 1.029 (95%CI: 1.001,1.057), 1.015 (95%CI: 1.001, 1.029) and 1.069 (95%CI: 1.038, 1.100), respectively. These three air pollutants were also associated with increased SBP (except for PM10), DBP and MAP. The hypertensive effects of air pollution were more pronounced among males, smokers, drinkers, individuals with a high-fat diet, and those with high-level physical activity.
Conclusion
Long-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 was associated with increased blood pressure and hypertension in rural Chinese adults, and the associations were modified by several behavioral factors.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies often focus on risk assessments associated with exposures to specific air pollutants or proximity to different air pollution sources. Although this information is essential for devising informed health policies, it is not always helpful when it comes to the estimation of potential health effects associated with the introduction or relocation of local health hazards. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach to forecasting the morbidity-reduction impact of hypothetical removal of a major air pollution source from a densely populated urban area. The proposed approach is implemented in three stages. First, we identify and measure the strength of association of individual environmental factors with local morbidity patterns. Next, we use the estimated models to simulate the impact of removal of the pollution source under analysis and its replacement by green areas. Using this assessment, we then estimate potential changes in the local morbidity rates by mutually comparing the observed risk surface of disease with the risk surface simulated by modelling. To validate the proposed approach empirically, we use childhood asthma morbidity data available for a major metropolitan area in Israel, which hosts a large petrochemical complex. According to our estimates, relocation of the petrochemical complex in question is expected to result in about 70% drop in the childhood asthma morbidity rate area-wide. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first that suggests an operational approach to incorporating epidemiological assessments as an input for urban development plans related to local sources of air pollution.},

abstract = {Exposure to long-term ambient air pollution is believed to have adverse effects on human health. However, the mechanisms underlying these impacts are poorly understood. DNA methylation, a crucial epigenetic modification, is susceptible to environmental factors and likely involved in these processes. We conducted a whole-genome bisulfite sequencing study on 120 participants from a highly polluted region (HPR) and a less polluted region (LPR) in China, where the HPR had much higher concentrations of five air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO) (fold difference 1.6 to 6.6 times; P value 1.80E-07 to 3.19E-23). Genome-wide methylation analysis revealed 371 DMRs in subjects from the two areas and these DMRs were located primarily in gene regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. Gene enrichment analysis showed that DMR-related genes were significantly enriched in diseases related to pulmonary disorders and cancers and in biological processes related to mitochondrial assembly and cytokine production. Further, HPR participants showed a higher mtDNA copy number. Of those identified DMRs, 15 were significantly correlated with mtDNA copy number. Finally, cytokine assay indicated that an increased plasma interleukin-5 level was associated with greater air pollution. Taken together, our findings suggest that exposure to long-term ambient air pollution can lead to alterations in DNA methylation whose functions relate to mitochondria and immune responses.},

abstract = {Background
Evidence of health effects following early life exposure to short-to-medium duration of high pollution levels is extremely limited.
Objectives
We aimed to evaluate the associations between: 1. intrauterine exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from coal mine fire emissions and the frequencies of general practitioner attendances and dispensations of prescribed asthma inhalers, steroid skin creams, and antibiotics during the first year of life; 2. infant exposure and those outcomes during the year following the fire.
Methods
All participants were recruited from the Latrobe Valley of Victoria, Australia. Participants' 24-h average and hourly peak mine fire-specific PM2.5 exposures from 09/02/2014 to 31/03/2014 were estimated using chemical transport modelling. Outcome data were obtained from the Australian Medicare Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from each child's birth to 31/12/2016. We used negative binomial and logistic regression models to independently assess risks of the outcomes associated with every 10 and 100 $\mu$g m−3 increase in average or peak PM2.5 exposure, respectively, while adjusting for potential confounders.
Results
We included 286 of 311 children whose parents consented to be linked, comprising 77 with no exposure, 88 with intrauterine exposure and 121 with exposure in infancy. 10- and 100- $\mu$g m−3 increases in average and peak PM2.5 exposure during infancy were associated with greater incidence of antibiotics being dispensed during the year following the fire: the adjusted incidence rate ratios were 1.24 (95% CI 1.02, 1.50, p = 0.036) and 1.14 (1.00, 1.31, p = 0.048) respectively. No other significant associations were observed.
Conclusion
Exposure to coal mine fire emissions during infancy was associated with increased dispensing of antibiotics. This could reflect increased childhood infections or increased prescriptions of antibiotics in the year following the fire.},

abstract = {There is enough scientific evidence indicating a relationship between particulate matter in ambient air and health. Since at a global scale there is an important number of people exposed to this pollutant, studies have focused on evaluating its possible effects on human population. Aburr{\'{a}} Valley Metropolitan Area (AMVA), in Antioquia-Colombia, is a region with about 3,909,729 inhabitants (2018), where 79% of PM2.5 present in the atmosphere is emitted by motor vehicles, with 1534 ton/year (AMVA, 2018). In the last decade, monitoring stations have reached daily mean concentrations of 113 $\mu$g/m3, which is 226% in excess of the maximum permissible daily level established at 50 $\mu$g/m3 by Colombian regulations (AMVA 2016; MinAmbiente, 2017). The object of the study was to evaluate the impact of PM2.5 concentrations in cases of premature mortality of urban population. To this end, the BenMap-CE v.1.1 model was used, together with Krewski et al. (2009) Health Impact functions to evaluate associations with adult mortality (>30 years of age) due to All Causes (AC)—including natural and non-natural—(ICD-10: A00-Y98), Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) (ICD-10: I20–I25) and LungCancer (LC) (ICD-10: C34); and Woodruff et al. (2006) functions to explore associations with child mortality (population 0–1 year of age) due to All Causes (AC)—including natural and non-natural. Health impact was evaluated for year 2016 (baseline) and estimated for 2020 and 2030, from annual mean concentrations reported and projected by the environmental authority. The study was carried out based on annual mean mortality rates reported for the period 2007–2016. Among the most relevant results, it was found that for 2016 the areas with the highest annual concentrations of PM2.5 were Medell{\'{i}}n (downtown area), Caldas, and Medell{\'{i}}n (northern area) (39.4 $\mu$g/m3, 33.7 $\mu$g/m3, and 33.2 $\mu$g/m3, respectively). Consequently, health impact estimations (mortality due to all causes in adults) showed the highest associations: 15.70% (676 cases; CI: 470.29–873.06), 12.90% (32 cases; CI: 22.04–41.34) and 12.63% (736 cases; CI: 508.65–954.76), respectively. For the Aburr{\'{a}} Valley Metropolitan Area in 2016, it was found that death cases attributable to PM2.5 levels were: 1971 cases (CI: 1362.96–2558.62) for adult mortality due to AC, 194 cases (CI: 92.04–284.17) due to LC and 932 cases (CI: 791.33–1063.56), figures comparatively lower than the estimates for 2030, where death cases attributable to the same pollutant were: 5867 cases (CI: 4190.12–7410.53) for adult mortality due to AC, 497 cases (CI: 265.47–666.77) due to LC and 2415 cases (CI: 2157.06–2632.99). These values were calculated from the sum of the estimations given by the BenMap model for each municipality in the Metropolitan Area. Finally, avoidable death cases were calculated for a scenario with the implementation and execution of 100% of the measures for the prevention and control of emissions from motor vehicles, as defined by the Integral Plan for Air Quality Management (PIGECA, AMVA, 2017a) for year 2030: 55.93% of infant mortality cases due to AC; 50.32% in adults due to AC; 55.73% in adults due to LC and 60.87% in adults due to IHD associated with PM2.5.},

The associations of long-term exposure to air pollution with osteoporosis are rarely reported, especially in rural China. This study aimed to explore the association among rural Chinese population.
Methods
A total of 8033 participants (18–79 years) derived from the Henan Rural Cohort Study (n = 39,259) were included in this cross-sectional study. Exposure to air pollutants was estimated using machine learning algorithms with satellite remote sensing, land use information, and meteorological data [including particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤1.0 $\mu$m (PM1), ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), and ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)]. The bone mineral density of each individual was measured by using ultrasonic bone density apparatus and osteoporosis was defined based on the T-score ≤ −2.5. Multiple logistic regression models were used to examine the association of air pollution and osteoporosis prevalence.
Results
We observed that per 1 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM1, PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 were associated with a 14.9%, 14.6%, 7.3%, and 16.5% elevated risk of osteoporosis. Compared with individuals in the first quartile, individuals in the fourth quartile had higher odds ratio (OR) of osteoporosis (P-trend < 0.001), the ORs (95% confidence interval) were 2.08 (1.72, 2.50) for PM1, 2.28 (1.90, 2.74) for PM2.5, 1.93 (1.60, 2.32) for PM10, and 2.02 (1.68, 2.41) for NO2. It was estimated that 20.29%–24.36% of osteoporosis cases could be attributable to air pollution in the rural population from China.
Conclusions
Long-term exposure to air pollutants were positively associated with high-risk of osteoporosis, indicated that improving air quality may be beneficial to improve rural residents health.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to traffic-related air pollution is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Evidence suggests that inhaled pollutants precipitate these effects via multiple pathways involving oxidative stress.
Objective
Postulating that a decrease in circulating antioxidant levels reflect an oxidative response, we investigated the effect of inhaled diesel exhaust (DE) on the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) in healthy adults, and whether pre-exposure antioxidant supplementation blunted this response. We also examined exposure-related changes in antioxidant/stress response leukocyte gene expression (GCLc, HMOX-1, IL-6, TGF$\beta$) and plasma IL-6 levels.
Methods
Nineteen nonsmoking adults participated in a double-blind, randomized, four-way crossover study. Each subject completed 120-min exposures to filtered air and DE (200 $\mu$g/m3), with and without antioxidant pretreatment. Antioxidant comprised 1000 mg ascorbate for 7 days and 1200 mg N-acetylcysteine 1 day prior to exposure, with 1000 mg and 600 mg, respectively, administered 2 h prior to exposure. Whole blood glutathione was measured pre- and post-exposure; plasma IL-6 and mRNA expression were quantified pre, during and post exposure.
Results
Diesel exhaust exposure was associated with significantly decreased GSH/GSSG (p = 0.001) and a 4-fold increase in IL-6 mRNA (p = 0.01) post exposure. Antioxidant pretreatment did not significantly mediate the effect of DE exposure on GSH/GSSG, though appeared to decrease the effect of exposure on IL-6 mRNA expression.
Conclusions
Acute DE inhalation induced detectable oxidative effects in healthy adults, which were not significantly attenuated by the selected antioxidant pre-treatment. This finding supports the premise that oxidative stress is one mechanism underlying the adverse effects of traffic-related air pollution.},

abstract = {Particulate air pollution is a continuing challenge in China, and its adverse effects on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been widely reported. However, epidemiological evidence on the associations between size-fractionated particle number concentrations (PNCs) and COPD mortality is limited. In this study, we utilized a time-series approach to investigate the associations between PNCs of particles at 0.25–10 $\mu$m in diameter and COPD mortality in Shanghai, China. Quasi-Poisson regression generalized additive models were applied to evaluate these associations, with adjustment of time trend, day of week, holidays, temperature and relative humidity. Stratification analyses were performed by season and gender. There were a total of 3238 deaths due to COPD during the study period. We found that daily COPD deaths were significantly associated with PNCs of particles <0.5 $\mu$m, and the magnitude of associations increased with decreasing particle size. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in PNC0.25—0.28, PNC0.28—0.3, PNC0.3—0.35, PNC0.35—0.4, PNC0.4—0.45 and PNC0.45—-0.5 was associated with increments of 7.51% (95%CI: 2.45%, 12.81%), 7.22% (95%CI: 2.16%, 12.53%), 6.95% (95%CI: 1.81%, 12.35%), 6.26% (95%CI: 1.25%, 11.52%), 5.24% (95%CI: 0.56%, 10.13%) and 4.15% (95%CI: 0.14%, 8.32%), respectively. The associations remained robustness after controlling for the mass concentrations of gaseous air pollutants. In stratification analyses, significant associations between PNCs and COPD mortality were observed in the cold seasons, and in males. Our results suggested that particles <0.5 $\mu$m in diameter might be most responsible for the adverse effects of particulate air pollution on COPD mortality, and COPD patients are more susceptible to PM air pollution in the cold seasons, especially for males.},

abstract = {Background
Both air pollution and airborne pollen can cause respiratory health problems. Since both are often jointly present in ambient air, it is important to control for one while estimating the effect of the other when considering pollution-abating policies. To date only a limited number of studies have considered the health effects of both irritants jointly for a general population, and for a sufficiently long time period to allow for variation in seasonal concentrations of both components. The primary goal of this study is to determine the causal impact of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on hospital visits and related treatment costs, while controlling for potentially confounding pollen effects. Our study area is the metropolitan hub of Reno/Sparks in Northern Nevada.
Methods
Taking advantage of a rare sample of daily pollen counts over a prolonged period of time (2009–2015), we model the effects of PM2.5 and pollen on respiratory-related hospital admissions for the population at large, plus specific age groups. Pollen data are provided by a local allergy clinic. Data on PM2.5 and other air pollutants are obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's air quality data web site. We collect daily meteorological data from the National Centers for Environmental Information's data repository. Data on hospital admissions are given by the Nevada Center for Surveys, Evaluations, and Statistics. Our econometric approach centers on a fully robust count data (Poisson) model, estimated via Quasi-Maximum Likelihood.
Results
We find that for our sample PM2.5 effects are largely robust to the inclusion of both pollen counts and temporal indicators. In contrast, pollen effects vanish when time fixed effects are added, pointing at their correlation with unobserved temporal confounders. At the same time, model fit improves with the inclusion of temporal indicators. Based on our preferred specification, we find a significant PM2.5 effect of approximately 0.5% additional hospital visits per day due to a one $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5. This translates into expected augmented treatment costs of 2700 per day for the same unit-change in PM2.5. These figures can mount quickly when more pronounced and/or longer episodes of particulate matter pollution are considered, perhaps due to wildfire smoke. For instance, the expected increase in patients and costs due to a month-long 10-unit-jump of PM2.5 over the long-run annual average would amount to an extra 70 patients and approximately 680,000 in additional treatment costs.},

abstract = {Exposure to air pollution has been associated with adverse health effects while exposure to greenspace has been associated with public health benefits. However, the available evidence on the association of exposure to air pollution with ovarian reserve markers is still scarce, with no study on such an association with greenspace exposure. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association of exposure to particulate matter with diameter of less than 1, 2.5 and 10 $\mu$m (PM1, PM2.5, PM10), traffic indicators (distance from women's residence to major roads and total street length in different buffers around women's residential address) and greenspace indicators (residential surrounding greenspace and distance to green spaces) with serum levels of anti-m{\"{u}}llerian hormone (AMH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) as markers of ovarian reserve. This cross-sectional study was based on 67 women residing in Sabzevar, Iran (2018). Basal serum levels of FSH and AMH were measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Land use regression models were used to estimate PMs concentrations at residential addresses and the average of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in different buffers was used to characterize residential surrounding greenspace. Multiple linear regression models were developed to estimate the association of AMH and FSH with exposure to air pollution, traffic, and greenspace (one at a time) controlled for relevant covariates. In fully adjusted models, there was an inverse association between exposure to PM1, PM2.5 as well as total street length in 100 m buffer around women's residence and AMH level ($\beta$ = −0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI): −1.43, −0.35, P-value ≤ 0.01, $\beta$ = −1.11, 95% CI: −1.67, −0.55, P-value ≤ 0.01 and $\beta$ = −0.76, 95% CI: −1.48, −0.50, P-value = 0.03, respectively). Moreover, increase in distance from home to nearest major road as well as residential surrounding greenspace (100 m buffer) and decrease in residential distance to a green space larger than 5000 m2 were associated with increase in serum level of AMH. However, we did not observe any significant association between exposure to air pollution, traffic, and greenspace with FSH level. Overall, our findings supported a beneficial association of exposure to greenspace and detrimental association of exposure to air pollution with ovarian reserve.},

abstract = {Urban environments are characterized by multiple exposures that may influence body mass index (BMI) growth in early life. Previous studies are few, with inconsistent results and no evaluation of simultaneous exposures. Thus, this study aimed to assess the associations between exposure to air pollution, green spaces and built environment characteristics, and BMI growth trajectories from 0 to 5 years. This longitudinal study used data from an electronic primary care health record database in Catalonia (Spain), including 79,992 children born between January 01, 2011 and December 31, 2012 in urban areas and followed until 5 years of age. Height and weight were measured frequently during childhood and BMI (kg/m2) was calculated. Urban exposures were estimated at census tract level and included: air pollution (nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter <10 $\mu$m (PM10) and <2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5)), green spaces (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and % green space) and built environment (population density, street connectivity, land use mix, walkability index). Individual BMI trajectories were estimated using linear spline multilevel models with several knot points. In single exposure models, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, and population density were associated with small increases in BMI growth (e.g. $\beta$ per IQR PM10 increase = 0.023 kg/m2, 95%CI: 0.013, 0.033), and NDVI, % of green spaces and land use mix with small reductions in BMI growth (e.g. $\beta$ per IQR % green spaces increase = −0.015 kg/m2, 95%CI: −0.026, −0.005). These associations were strongest during the first two months of life. In multiple exposure models, most associations were attenuated, with only those for PM10 and land use mix remaining statistically significant. This large longitudinal study suggests that early life exposure to air pollution, green space and built environment characteristics may be associated with small changes in BMI growth trajectories during the first years of life, and that it is important to account for multiple exposures in urban settings.},

abstract = {Background
Air pollution is one of the major health risk factors in urban populations. Air pollution has been associated with asthma in children. Air pollution has also been suggested to be distributed unequally within the cities, something that can lead to urban health inequalities.
Aim
We aimed to estimate the number of childhood asthma cases attributable to three main air pollutants; Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Particulate Matter (PM 2.5), and Black Carbon (BC) in the city of Barcelona, Spain. We also aimed to describe the distribution of those impacts depending on the social deprivation index in Barcelona.
Methods
We estimated the number of childhood asthma cases in Barcelona by applying a quantitative Health Impact Assessment (HIA) approach. Air pollution (NO2, PM2.5, and BC) exposure assessment was estimated using a land-use regression model. Two scenarios were assessed and compared the current levels of air pollution with 1) achieving the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline on exposure levels for NO2 and PM2.5 (scenario 1); and 2) achieving the minimum reported levels in a previously published meta-analysis (scenario 2), from where we also obtained the exposure-response functions. The relative risk and population attributable fraction (PAF) for each scenario and pollutant were estimated. Using the asthma incidence rate in Spain the expected number of asthma cases in Barcelona attributable to NO2, PM2.5, and BC for each scenario was estimated.
Results
The annual average levels of NO2, PM2.5, and BC at census levels were 56 $\mu$g/m3, 17.11 $\mu$g/m3, and 2.88 $\mu$g/m3, respectively. The number of asthma cases attributable to NO2 and PM2.5 (percentage of total cases) estimated in scenario 1 was 454 (18%) and 478 (19%) respectively. For scenario 2, the estimated number of cases attributable to NO2, PM2.5, and BC were 1230 (48%), 992 (39%) and 789 (31%) respectively. Although NO2 and BC showed differences between asthma cases and areas with different deprivation index, only BC differences were statistically significant between less and more deprived areas.
Conclusions
This study estimated that up to 1230 (48%) of asthma cases in Barcelona could be attributable to air pollution each year. This study also found that in Barcelona, less socially deprived groups could be more affected by asthma-related to air pollution than those more socially deprived.},

abstract = {Currently the Chinese government has adopted World Health Organization interim target-1 values as the national ambient air quality standards values. However, the population-based evidence was insufficient, especially for the oldest old (aged 80+). We evaluated the association of fine particulate matters (PM2.5) exposure and incidence of disability in activities of daily living (ADL) in 15 453 oldest old in 886 counties/cities in China from 2002 to 2014 using Cox model with penalized splines and competing risk models to evaluate the linear or non-linear association. After adjusting for potential confounders, a J-shaped association existed between PM2.5 exposure with a threshold concentration of 33 $\mu$g/m3, and incident disability in ADL. Above this threshold, the risk magnitude significantly increased with increase of PM2.5 concentrations; compared to 33 $\mu$g/m3, the hazard ratio ranged from 1.03 (1.00–1.06) at 40 $\mu$g/m3 to 2.25 (1.54–3.29) at 110 $\mu$g/m3. The risk magnitude was not significantly changed below this threshold. Each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure corresponded to a 7.7% increase in the risk of disability in ADL (hazard ratio 1.077, 95% CI 1.051–1.104). Men, smokers, and participants with cognitive impairment might be more vulnerable to PM2.5 exposure. The study provided limited population-based evidence for the oldest old and detected a threshold of 33 $\mu$g/m3, and supported that reduction to current World Health Organization interim target-1value (35 $\mu$g/m3) and Chinese national ambient air quality standards (35 $\mu$g/m3) or lower may be associated with lower risk of disability in ADL.},

abstract = {Mobile source emissions have significantly contributed to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution in urban atmospheric environments. Few studies have explored on-road vehicular PM2.5 emissions and the health effects attributed to these emissions under different traffic conditions. Based on driving data obtained from 20000 taxi receipts, a motor vehicle emission simulator (MOVES) model was used to estimate the PM2.5 emission levels of motor vehicles in the urban area within the Sixth Ring Road of Beijing (SRRB) on weekdays and weekends, respectively. Two different PM2.5 exposure scenarios were further simulated using an atmospheric dispersion model. Subsequently, the health effects attributable to traffic-related PM2.5 exposure were quantified by using exposure-response function to calculate the population acute morbidity and premature mortality during different time periods. We found that PM2.5 emission levels of motor vehicles on normal weekdays were overall higher than those on weekends. The median vehicular PM2.5 dispersion concentration in the study area was 2.68 $\mu$g/m3 on weekdays and 1.82 $\mu$g/m3 on weekends. Annually, there were 4435 premature deaths attributed to vehicle emissions (95% confidence interval (CI): 3655, 4904) under weekday exposure conditions, and this number sharply decreased to 3462 (95% CI: 3052, 4011) on weekends. Considering the hourly measurements, road traffic emissions have the greatest impact on public health during morning rush hour (8:00 a.m.). Total PM2.5 emissions were closely associated with road traffic conditions and largely determined the magnitude of the health impacts caused by traffic-related PM2.5 exposure. These findings provide information to aid in formulating reasonable public health policies to address vehicular PM2.5 emission-induced health implications.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies have reported an association between air pollution and central nervous system disorders. However, its biological mechanisms are poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the effect of short-term environmental exposure to PM10 and associated heavy metals on changes in blood and urinary nervous markers in dusty conditions. A total of 44 healthy non-smokers were identified with a mean age of 36 years. Blood and urine samples were taken from these people 24 h before and after the dust storm to measure the biomarkers of the central nervous system. Cortisol, white blood cells (WBCs), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and S100$\beta$ were measured as blood markers, while vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) were tracked as urine markers. These people had 7 h of environmental exposure in dusty conditions. Eleven heavy metals (Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Co, Pb, and Zn) associated with PM10 were measured. The average PM10 concentration on dust days was 3.25 times higher than on normal days (309.81 $\mu$g m−3 vs. 86.11 $\mu$g m−3). The results of the statistical paired T-test showed that the mean S100$\beta$ from pre-exposure to post-exposure increased by 5.85 ng L−1 (P ≤ 0.004). The NSE mean of the pre-exposure (3.37 ± 3.48 $\mu$g L−1) was significantly different from the NSE mean after exposure)4.15 ± 3.74 $\mu$g L−1 ((P = 0.002). The post-exposure WBC mean was 0.59 times higher than that before exposure, albeit not statistically significant (P = 0.269). The mean VMA after exposure increased by 0.55 mg g−1 CRT (Creatinine) compared to that before exposure. This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.000). Changes in S100$\beta$ after exposure to dust storms had a high correlation with changes in Cr, Pb, and Fe metal concentrations, respectively (r = 0.81, r = 0.72, r = 0. 65). NSE changes were significantly associated with changes in Mn, Cd, and Fe (r = 0.71, r = 0.99, r = 0.71). Heavy metals associated with PM10 can damage neurons and astrocytes, promoting neuropsychiatric disorders in people with exposure.},

This study aimed to examine the associations of PM2.5-10 with cause-specific hospitalizations in a multi-city setting in southwestern China and assess the attributable risk and economic costs. City-specific associations were firstly estimated using generalized additive models with quasi-poisson distribution to handle over-dispersion, and then combined to obtain the regional average association. City-specific and pooled concentration-response (C-R) associations of PM2.5-10 with cause-specific hospitalizations were also modeled. Subgroup analyses were performed by age, sex, season and region. The health and economic burden of hospitalizations for multiple outcomes due to PM2.5-10 were further evaluated. A total of 4,407,601 non-accidental hospitalizations were collected from 678 hospitals. The estimates of percentage change in hospitalizations per 10 $\mu$g/m³ increase in PM2.5-10 at lag01 was 0.68% (95%CI: 0.33%–1.03%) for non-accidental causes, 0.86% (95% CI: 0.36%–1.37%) for circulatory diseases, 1.52% (95% CI: 1.00%–2.05%) for respiratory diseases, 1.08% (95% CI: 0.47%–1.69%) for endocrine diseases, 0.66% (95% CI: 0.12%–1.21%) for nervous system diseases, and 0.84% (95% CI: 0.42%–1.25%) for genitourinary diseases, respectively. The C-R associations of PM2.5-10 with cause-specific hospitalizations suggested some evidence of nonlinearity, except for endocrine diseases. Meanwhile, the adverse effects were modified by age and season. Overall, about 0.70% (95% CI: 0.35%–1.06%) of non-accidental hospitalizations and 0.78% (95% CI: 0.38%–1.17%) of total hospitalization expenses could be attributed to PM2.5-10. The largest morbidity burden and economic costs were observed in respiratory diseases. Our findings indicate that PM2.5-10 exposure may increase the risk of hospitalizations for multiple outcomes, and account for considerable morbidity and economic burden.},

In this study, we investigated changes in the clinical parameters of DED according to exposure to outdoor air pollutants, including PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 $\mu$m), PM10 (less than 10 $\mu$m), and ozone. A prospective observational study was conducted on 43 DED patients who had used the same topical eye drop treatment between 2016 and 2018 in South Korea. Ocular surface discomfort index (OSDI) score, tear film break-up time (TBUT), corneal fluorescein staining score (CFSS), and tear secretion were measured during each visit. Air pollution data of ambient PM10, PM2.5, and ozone, based on the patients' address, were obtained, and mean concentrations were computed for one day, one week, and one month before the examination. The relationships between air pollutants and DED were analyzed in single- and multi-pollutant models adjusted for demographic and clinical factors. In the multi-pollutant model, the OSDI score was positively correlated with ozone and PM2.5 exposure [ozone: $\beta$(exposure for 1 day/1 week) = 0.328 (95% CI: 0.161–0.494)/0.494 (0.286–0.702), p < 0.001/<0.001, per 1 ppb increase; PM2.5: $\beta$(1 day/1 week) = 0.378 (0.055–0.699)/0.397 (0.092–0.703), p = 0.022/ = 0.011, per 1 $\mu$g/m3 increase], and tear secretion decreased with increased ozone exposure [ozone: $\beta$(1 week/1 month) = −0.144 (−0.238 to −0.049)/-0.164 (−0.298 to −0.029), p = 0.003/ = 0.017, per 1 ppb increase]. Interestingly, increased PM10 exposure was only associated with decreased TBUT [$\beta$(1 day/1 week/1 month) = −0.028(-0.045 to −0.011)/-0.029(-0.046 to −0.012)/-0.023(-0.034 to −0.006), p = 0.001/ = 0.001/ = 0.018, per 1 $\mu$g/m3 increase]. Tear secretion and CFSS were not associated with PM10 exposure. Increased ozone and PM2.5 exposure led to aggravated ocular discomfort, and increased PM10 concentration aggravated tear film stability in patients with DED. Thus, each air pollutant may aggravate DED via different mechanisms of action.},

Results showed some municipalities with high PM concentrations, which exceeded the limits suggested by WHO. In terms of health issues, cardiovascular diseases in a population older than 30 years were the main cause of death from PM emissions.

abstract = {Introduction
Epidemiologic studies have reported associations between short-term exposure to particulate matter <2.5 $\mu$m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and mortality, but the role of modifiers remains unclear with studies reporting inconsistent results. We evaluated the impact of individual (age, gender and education) and township (geographic area, socioeconomic status, background air pollution and road density) level factors on the relationship between short-term variation in PM2.5 with cause-specific mortality in Beijing (population: 21.7 million in 2016), China.
Methods
Daily PM2.5 concentrations in each township (n = 327; township population: 2000–359,400; township area: 1–392 km2) within Beijing were estimated by kriging with external drift using measurements from 35 air quality monitoring stations and geographic variables. Time-stratified case-crossover analysis with township-level mortality data from Oct. 1st, 2012 to Dec. 31st, 2013 was then used to examine associations between PM2.5 exposure estimates and cause-specific mortality, stratified by the potential effect modifiers.
Results
A 10-$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration was associated with a 0.17% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05%–0.29%] and 0.27% (95%CI:0.01%–0.52%) increase in non-accidental and stroke mortality with no lag, a 0.81% (95%CI:0.39%–1.23%) and 0.96% (95%CI:0.35%–1.57%) increase in respiratory disease (RD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality at a lag of two-day moving average. For individual-level effect modifiers, the elderly showed higher effects for all the specific causes of mortality; those with lower education level showed higher effects for non-accidental, cardiovascular disease and stroke mortality; females showed higher effects for non-accidental and cause-specific cardiovascular diseases. For township-level effect modifiers, effect estimates tended to be larger for suburban areas, areas of lower road density, lower PM2.5 and lower socioeconomic status.
Conclusions
Short-term exposure to township-level ambient PM2.5 was associated with increased mortality in Beijing, with indications of effect modification by both individual and township-level factors.},

abstract = {Background
Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with a wide range of acute and chronic health effects, including increased risk of respiratory infection. However, evidence specifically related to novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is limited.
Methods
COVID-19 case counts for 111 Canadian health regions were obtained from the COVID-19 Canada Open Data portal. Annual PM2.5 data for 2000–2016 were estimated from a national exposure surface based on remote sensing, chemical transport modelling and ground observations, and minimum and maximum temperature data for 2000–2015 were based on a national interpolated surface derived from thin-plate smoothing splines. Population counts and sociodemographic data by health region were obtained from the 2016 census, and health data (self-rated health and prevalence of smoking, obesity, and selected chronic diseases) by health region, were obtained from the Canadian Community Health Survey. Data on total number of COVID-19 tests and changes in mobility comparing post-vs. pre-introduction of social distancing measures were available by province. Data were analyzed using negative binomial regression models.
Results
After controlling for province, temperature, demographic and health characteristics and days since peak incidence by health region, long-term PM2.5 exposure exhibited a positive association with COVID-19 incidence (incidence rate ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.97–1.18 per $\mu$g/m3). This association was larger in magnitude and statistically significant in analyses excluding provinces that reported cases only for aggregated health regions, excluding health regions with less than median population density, and restricted to the most highly affected provinces (Quebec and Ontario).
Conclusions
We observed a positive association between COVID-19 incidence and long-term PM2.5 exposure in Canadian health regions. The association was larger in magnitude and statistically significant in more highly affected health regions and those with potentially less exposure measurement error. While our results generate hypotheses for further testing, they should be interpreted with caution and require further examination using study designs less prone to bias.},

abstract = {Short-term exposure to air pollutants has been extensively related to daily mortality, however most of the evidence comes from studies conducted in major cities, and little is known on the extent of the spatial heterogeneity in the effects within areas including both urban and non-urban settings. We aimed to investigate the short-term association of air pollutants with daily cause-specific mortality in the Stockholm county, and to test whether an association exists also outside the metropolitan area. We used a spatiotemporal random forest model to predict daily concentrations of fine and inhalable particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) at 1-km spatial resolution over Sweden for 2005–2016. We collected data on daily mortality for each small area for market statistics (SAMS) of the Stockholm county, to which we matched daily exposures to air pollutants and air temperature. We applied a case-crossover design to investigate the short-term association between the four pollutants and mortality from non-accidental, cardiovascular and respiratory causes. We compared the associations in and out the Stockholm urban area, by SAMS population density and across the 26 municipalities of the county. We found weak effects of most air pollutants on cause-specific mortality in the full year analysis, with estimates much larger and significant only during the warmer months (April to September): non-accidental mortality increased by 4.58% (95% confidence interval – 95% CI: 0.89%, 8.41%) and by 2.21% (95% CI: 0.71%, 3.73%) per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in lag 0–1 PM2.5 and O3, respectively. Associations were in general higher in the Stockholm city and in SAMS with high population density. When comparing the 26 municipalities, we didn't detect a significant heterogeneity in the short-term associations with air pollutants. In conclusion, we found a suggestion of a harmful role of air pollution also in non-urban areas, but the study was underpowered to draw firm conclusions. We consider this study as a pilot to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of the association between daily air pollution and mortality at the national level in Sweden.},

abstract = {Background
Evidence links gestational exposure to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) with changes in leukocyte telomere length in cord blood with some studies showing sex-specific effects. PM2.5 exposure in utero increases oxidative stress, which can impact telomere biology. Thus, maternal antioxidant intakes may also modify the particulate air pollution effects.
Methods
We examined associations among prenatal PM2.5 exposure and newborn relative leukocyte telomere length (rLTL), and the modifying effects of maternal antioxidant intake and infant sex. We estimated daily PM2.5 exposures over gestation using a validated spatiotemporally resolved satellite-based model. Maternal dietary and supplemental antioxidant intakes over the prior three months were ascertained during the second trimester using the modified Block98 food frequency questionnaire; high and low antioxidant intakes were categorized based on a median split. We employed Bayesian distributed lag interaction models (BDLIMs) to identify both sensitive windows of exposure and cumulative effect estimates for prenatal PM2.5 exposure on newborn rLTL, and to examine effect modification by maternal antioxidant intakes. A 3-way interaction between PM2.5, maternal antioxidant intake and infant sex was also explored.
Results
For the main effect of PM2.5, BDLIMs identified a sensitive window at 12–20 weeks gestation for the association between increased prenatal PM2.5 exposure and shorter newborn rLTL and a cumulative effect of PM2.5 over gestation on newborn telomere length [cumulative effect estimate (CEE) = −0.29 (95% CI -0.49 to −0.10) per 1$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5]. In models examining maternal antioxidant intake effects, BDLIMs found that children born to mothers reporting low antioxidant intakes were most vulnerable [CEE of low maternal antioxidant intake = −0.31 (95% CI -0.55 to −0.06) vs high maternal antioxidant intake = −0.07 (95% CI -0.34 to 0.17) per 1$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5]. In exploratory models examining effect modification by both maternal antioxidant intakes and infant sex, the cumulative effect remained significant only in boys whose mothers reported low antioxidant intakes [CEE = −0.38 (95% CI -0.80 to −0.004)]; no sensitive windows were identified in any group.
Conclusions
Prenatal PM2.5 exposure in mid-gestation was associated with reduced infant telomere length. Higher maternal antioxidant intakes mitigated these effects.},

abstract = {Existing studies focused on the evaluation of health burden of long-term exposure to air pollutants, whereas limited information is available on short-term exposure, particularly in China. Air pollutant concentrations in 338 Chinese cities in 2017 were used to estimate the air pollutants related health burden which was defined as premature mortalities from all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory disease as well as hospital admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Log-linear model was used as the exposure-response function to estimate the health burden attributable to each air pollutant. The value of statistical life and cost of illness methods were used to estimate economic loss of the premature mortalities and hospital admissions, respectively. The national all-cause premature mortalities attributable to all air pollutants was 1.35 million, accounting for 17.2% of reported deaths in China in 2017. Among all-cause premature mortality, contributions of PM2.5, PM2.5-10, NO2, SO2, O3 and CO were11.1%, 5.2%, 28.9%, 9.6%, 23.0%, and 22.2%, respectively. The national cardiovascular and respiratory premature mortalities were 0.77 and 0.21 million, respectively. About 7.8 million cardiovascular and respiratory disease hospital admissions were attributed to short-term exposure to all air pollutants. The economic loss of the overall health burden (premature mortality and hospital admissions) was 2065.54 billion Yuan, which was equivalent to 2.5% of the national GDP in 2017. The health burden and economic loss attributable to short-term exposure to ambient air pollutant are substantial in China. It suggested that the adverse health effects attributable to short-term exposure to air pollutant should not be neglected in China. In order to reduce the health impact of air pollution, each city should develop air pollution prevention and control measures based on existing scientific evidence.},

abstract = {Sensing of pathogens by specialized receptors is the hallmark of the innate immunity. Innate immune response also mounts a defense response against various allergens and pollutants including particulate matter present in the atmosphere. Air pollution has been included as the top threat to global health declared by WHO which aims to cover more than three billion people against health emergencies from 2019 to 2023. Particulate matter (PM), one of the major components of air pollution, is a significant risk factor for many human diseases and its adverse effects include morbidity and premature deaths throughout the world. Several clinical and epidemiological studies have identified a key link between the PM existence and the prevalence of respiratory and inflammatory disorders. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood. Here, we investigated the influence of air pollutant, PM10 (particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 $\mu$m) during RNA virus infections using Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) – H5N1 virus. We thus characterized the transcriptomic profile of lung epithelial cell line, A549 treated with PM10 prior to H5N1infection, which is known to cause severe lung damage and respiratory disease. We found that PM10 enhances vulnerability (by cellular damage) and regulates virus infectivity to enhance overall pathogenic burden in the lung cells. Additionally, the transcriptomic profile highlights the connection of host factors related to various metabolic pathways and immune responses which were dysregulated during virus infection. Collectively, our findings suggest a strong link between the prevalence of respiratory illness and its association with the air quality.},

The purpose of this meta-analysis is to quantitatively analyze the relationship between maternal air pollutant exposure and low birth weight (LBW). PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched to obtain the studies on the relationship between the prenatal exposure of air pollutants and LBW that published as of June 2020. The pooled effects of air pollutant exposure and LBW were calculated using random-effect model (for studies with significant heterogeneity) or fixed-effect model (for studies without significant heterogeneity). Totally, 54 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled effect of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, and O3 exposure on LBW were 1.081 (95% CI: 1.043, 1.120), 1.053 (95% CI: 1.030, 1.076), 1.030 (95% CI: 1.008, 1.053), 1.007 (95% CI: 1.001, 1.014), 1.125 (95% CI: 1.017, 1.244), and 1.045 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.086), respectively. NO2 (per 10 ppb increase) and CO (per 100 ppb increase) exposure in the first trimester were positively correlated with LBW, of which the pooled effect was 1.022 (95% CI: 1.009, 1. 035) and 1.008 (95% CI: 1.004, 1.012), respectively. PM2.5 (per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase) exposure in the third trimester significantly affected the LBW, of which the pooled effect was 1.053 (95% CI: 1.010, 1.097). In addition, PM10 (per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase) exposure in the second trimester also significantly affected the LBW, with the pooled effect of 1.011 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.017). Prenatal exposure of the major air pollutants during the entire pregnancy could increase the risk of LBW, while the susceptible window of the pollutants varied.},

abstract = {Background
Abnormal semen quality is one of the common causes of infertility. The relationship between exposure to air pollutants and semen quality is unclear.
Objectives
To evaluate the impact of ambient air pollutant exposures on semen quality.
Methods
We analyzed 3797 semen samples from Guangdong Human Sperm Bank between May 28, 2018 and March 31, 2019. The inverse distance weighted interpolation method was used to estimate the personal exposures to CO, SO2, NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5 during the entire period (0–90 lag days) and key periods (0–9, 10–14, 70–90 lag days) of sperm development. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the exposure-response relationships between air pollutants and semen quality, including sperm concentration, sperm count and sperm motility, after adjusting for other covariates. The regression coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) associated with each interquartile range (IQR) increase in pollutant concentrations were estimated for each semen quality parameter.
Results
Overall, we observed a significant association of decreased sperm count with the exposure to PM10 (−0.2466; −0.4443, −0.0489) and PM2.5 (−0.2910; −0.5401, −0.0419). Among the sperm quality parameters assessed, sperm count was observed more frequently to be negatively associated with ambient air pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5), especially for the period during 10–14 lag days. In addition, motility decline was significantly associated with O3 in the late stage of sperm development. Sensitivity analyses for subgroup population yielded similar results. No significant association was found between all pollutants and sperm concentration (all P > 0.05).
Conclusions
Our results indicate that ambient air pollutants exposures during sperm development may have an adverse effect on semen quality, especially for sperm count and motility. The findings emphasize the potential to improve semen quality by reducing ambient air pollutant exposures, and the importance of taking into account the critical period of sperm development when protective measures are implemented.},

abstract = {Association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and obesity remains inconclusive, and the evidence from rural areas was limited. Thus, this study aimed to assess the association between ambient air pollution and obesity based on different anthropometric indices in Chinese rural adults, and further to compare the effect sizes of different air pollution types. A total of 38,824 participants (aged 18–79 years) were recruited from the Henan Rural Cohort Study. Logistic and multivariable linear regression model were used to examine the association between ambient air pollution exposure (including particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤ 1.0 $\mu$m (PM1), ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), and ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) and obesity as well as obese anthropometric indices (including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), body fat percentage (BFP), and visceral fat index (VFI)). The potential effect modifications were also examined. Positive associations were found between long-term exposure to PM1, PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 and obesity regardless of how obesity was defined (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). Moreover, BMI, WC, WHR, WHtR, BFP, and VFI displayed increased trends with PM1, PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 concentrations increasing (all FDR<0.05). PM10 had the largest effects on obesity among the four types of air pollution. The elderly, women, individuals with low level of education and income, and those who had high fat diet were more vulnerable to the adverse effects of air pollution. In addition, the results of the sensitivity analysis showed that those associations between ambient air pollution and obesity remained robust. These findings suggest that long-term exposure to ambient air pollutant (particularly PM10) may be positively associated with obesity in Chinese rural adults, especially among the elderly, women, individuals with low education and income, as well as unhealthy lifestyles.},

Short- and long-term exposure to NO2 has been studied and is well-documented in existing literature, but information on intermediate-term NO2 effects and mortality is lacking, despite biological plausibility. We obtained daily NO2 and mortality data from 42 counties in China from 2013 to 2015. Distributed-lag non-linear models were employed to investigate the relationship between non-accidental mortality and NO2 up to 30 days before the event, including PM2.5, temperature, relative humidity, and holidays as covariates in a random effects meta-analysis pooling county-specific estimates. We repeated the analysis for cardiovascular- and respiratory-related mortality, and explored sex-stratified associations. Per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in NO2, we estimated a 0.13% (95%CI: 0.03, 0.23%), 0.57% (95%CI: −0.04, 1.18%), and −0.14% (95%CI: −1.63, 1.37%) change in non-accidental mortality for same-day and previous-day NO2 (lag0-1 cumulated), in the preceding 7 days (lag0-7 cumulated), and in the preceding 30 days (lag0-30 cumulated), respectively. The strongest estimate was observed for respiratory-related mortality in the lag0-30 cumulated effect for women (3.12%; 95%CI: −1.66, 8.13%). We observed a trend of higher effect estimates of intermediate-term NO2 exposure on respiratory mortality compared to that of the short-term, although the differences were not statistically significant. Our results at longer lags for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were sensitive to modeling choices. Future work should further investigate intermediate-term air pollution exposure given their potential biological relevance, but in larger scale settings.},

In this study, we systematically analyse the spatio-temporal patterns of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, and O3 and the associated health risks, using data collected from 1498 national air quality monitoring sites. An analysis of the averaged data from all the sites indicated that, from 2015 to 2018, annual mean concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and CO declined by 3.2 $\mu$g m−3, 3.7 $\mu$g m−3, 3.9 $\mu$g m−3, and 0.1 mg m−3, respectively. In contrast, those of NO2 and O3 increased at rates of 0.4 and 3.1 $\mu$g m−3, respectively. Except for O3, the annual mean concentrations of all pollutants were generally the highest in North China and lowest in the Tibetan Plateau. The concentrations were generally higher in the north of the country than in the south. In all regions of China, the pollutant concentrations were the highest in winter and lowest in summer, except for O3, which showed an opposite seasonal pattern. Overall, the seasonal mean concentrations of all the pollutants (except for O3) significantly decreased between the same seasons in 2018 and 2015, whereas the seasonal mean O3 concentrations generally significantly increased, and/or remained at stable levels in all four seasons except for winter. Diurnal variations of all pollutants (except for O3) exhibited a bimodal pattern with peaks between 8:00 and 11:00 a.m. and 9:00 and 12:00 p.m., whereas O3 exhibited a unimodal pattern with maximum values between 5:00 and 7:00 p.m. No significant differences in the daily mean concentrations of all pollutants were found between weekdays and weekends in all regions, except for PM2.5 and PM10 in Northeast China. In Northwest China and Southeast China, PM2.5 showed stronger correlations with NO2 relative to SO2, suggesting that NOx emission control may be more effective than SO2 emission control for alleviating PM2.5 formation. Compared with 2015, the total PM2.5-attributable mortality, number of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and incidence of chronic bronchitis decreased overall by 23.4%–26.9% in 2018. In contrast, for O3-attributable deaths, there was an increase of 18.9%. Our study not only improves the understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of air pollutants in China, but also highlights that synchronous control of PM2.5 and O3 pollution should be implemented to achieve dual benefits in protecting human health.},

Number of deaths and YLL were estimated with AirQ + software tool using available concentration-response functions and life table approach. Furthermore, the value of lost life in each city were calculated using the Value of Statistical Life (VSL) method. Two scenarios were defined; Scenario A, considering actual observed concentrations to estimate the real health effects of PM2.5, and Scenario B, controlling for the effect of air pollution episodes. The results showed that the annual average concentrations of PM2.5 in cities were 1.5–6.1 times higher than the guideline value of WHO (10 $\mu$g/m³). The total number of all-cause deaths due to long-term exposure exceeding WHO air quality guideline level was 13321 (95% C.I.: 8837–17378) cases per year in all cities. The total numbers of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, ischemic heart disease (IHD), and stroke deaths attributed to the exposure were 274, 315, 1536, and 963 cases, respectively. The total number of YLL over 10 years period in all 25 cities was 486,289 years and the loss of life expectancy ranged from 0.43 to 1.87 years. The sum of economic losses due to lost life exceeded 5.8 billion USD. Except for some cities, avoiding highly polluted days in Scenario B would result in only 5% reduction in overall health or economic effects. These results indicate an urgent need for new comprehensive plans to tackle air pollution in Iranian cities focused on reduction of long term average pollution levels since programs for avoiding highly polluted days lead to a limited health benefits only.},

Previous studies have provided evidence that prenatal exposure to low-level air pollution increases the risk of preterm birth (PTB), but the findings of the effects of short-term exposure have been inconclusive. Moreover, there is little knowledge on potential synergistic effects of different combinations of air pollutants.
Objectives
To assess independent and joint effects of prenatal exposure to air pollutants during the week prior to the delivery on the risk of PTB.
Methods
The study population included 2568 members of the Espoo Cohort Study, living in the City of Espoo, Finland, born between 1984 and 1990. We assessed individual-level prenatal exposure to ambient air pollutants of interest based on maternal residential addresses, while taking into account their residential mobility. We used both regional-to-city-scale dispersion modelling and land-use regression–based method to estimates the pollutant concentrations. We contrasted the risk of PTB in the highest quartile (Q4) of exposure to the lower exposure quartiles (Q1-Q3) during the specific periods of pregnancy. We applied Poisson regression analysis to estimate the adjusted risk ratios (RRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for season of birth, maternal age, sex of the baby, family's socioeconomic status, maternal smoking, and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke during pregnancy, single parenthood, and exposure to other air pollutants (this in multi-pollutant models).
Results
The risk of PTB was related to exposures to PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 during the week prior to the delivery with adjusted RRs of 1.67 (95%CI: 1.14, 2.46), 1.60 (95% CI: 1.09, 2.34) and 1.65 (95% CI: 1.14, 2.37), from three-pollutant models respectively. There were no significant joint effects for these different air pollutants (during the week prior to the delivery).
Conclusion
Our results provide evidence that exposure to fairly low-level air pollution may trigger PTB, but synergistic effects of different pollutants are not likely.},

Investigations that directly relate hospital outpatient visits for endocrine (ENDO), digestive (DIGE), urological (UROL), and dermatological (DERM) diseases categories with ambient particulate matter (PM) are still lacking, particularly in heavily polluted cities. Here, we conducted a time-series analysis using 812,624, 1,111,342, 539,803, and 741,662 hospital visits for ENDO, DIGE, UROL, and DERM, respectively, in Nanjing, China from 2013 to 2019. A generalized additive model was applied to estimate the exposure-response associations. Results showed that a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration on lag 0 day was significantly associated with 0.59% (95% CI: 0.30%, 0.88%), 0.43% (0.15%, 0.70%), 0.36% (0.06%, 0.66%), and 0.65% (0.42%, 0.87%) increase for ENDO, DIGE, UROL, and DERM hospital visits, respectively. The estimated effects of PM10 were slightly smaller but still statistically significant. The magnitude and significance of the associations between PM and four health outcomes were sensitive to additional adjustment for co-pollutants. Exposure-response relationships were linear for PM concentrations lower than 100 $\mu$g/m3 but the curves became nonlinear across the full range of exposures due to a flatten slope at higher concentrations. We also explored the effect modifications by season (cold or warm), age (5–18, 18–64, 65–74, or 75+ years), and sex (male or female). Results showed that the DERM-related population aged 65 years or older was more vulnerable to PM exposure, compared with the 5 to 17-year age group; the DERM-related population aged 75 years or older and 65 years or older was more vulnerable to PM2.5 and PM10 exposure, respectively, compared with the 18 to 64-year age group. Our study provided suggestive evidence that ambient PM pollution was associated with ENDO, DIGE, UROL, and DERM outpatient hospital visits in Nanjing, China.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to ambient particulate air pollution contributes substantially to the mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD), respiratory diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. Several hypothetical mechanisms have been proposed to explain these associations, particularly oxidative stress. Malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) are typical biomarkers of oxidative stress and have been frequently investigated. However, the association between exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) and these biomarkers has not been well established.
Objectives
Evaluate the association between ambient particulate air pollution and biomarkers of oxidative stress based on existing epidemiological studies.
Methods
A systematic literature search was conducted in databases of Science Direct, PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus up to April 24, 2020 to summarize epidemiological studies reporting the association between exposure to ambient PM (PM2.5, PM10, or both) and biomarkers of oxidative stress, and a meta-analysis was performed for the associations reported in individual studies using a random-effect model.
Results
This meta-analysis included 23 epidemiological studies (13 identified for 8-OHdG, 11 identified for MDA and 5 identified for SOD). A 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in short-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 was associated with pooled percent changes of 2.10% (95% CIs: −0.13%, 4.38%), 1.60% (95% CIs: 0.21%, 3.01%) and −0.61% (95% CIs: −1.92%, 0.72%) in 8-OHdG, MDA and SOD, respectively.
Conclusion
Short-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 was associated with a significantly increased level of MDA, indicating that ambient particulate air pollution may contribute to increased oxidative stress.},

Exposure to ambient air pollution has negative impact on animal reproduction and fertility, however, its effect on human reproduction has been inconclusive. We conducted a retrospective study on in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients from Chengdu, Sichuan Province in western China, a city with persistent ambient air pollution. We analyzed the medical records of 1139 patients who underwent first conventional IVF cycles during 2014–2019. The relationship between six atmospheric pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, CO) and IVF pregnancy outcomes were assessed by 1) stratification of maternal age into three groups (<35, 35–39, ≥40 years), and by 2) averaging pollutant concentration during different exposure windows. The results indicate that the association between ambient air pollution and IVF pregnancy outcomes (biochemical pregnancy and clinical pregnancy) is more significant for women in <35 years age group. Concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2 and CO are negatively associated with the odds of biochemical pregnancy and clinical pregnancy, and concentration of CO in particular is associated with the largest reduction in odds. Conversely, O3 concentration is positively associated with biochemical pregnancy and clinical pregnancy. Moreover, pollutant concentration during long-term exposure window is associated with larger magnitude of change in the odds of biochemical pregnancy and clinical pregnancy. Findings from this study suggest that exposure to ambient air pollution during any period within the IVF treatment timeline would influence IVF pregnancy outcomes, and such influence is more pronounced in younger women (<35 years).},

abstract = {Background
Short-term exposure to high level of ambient particulate matters (PM) concentrations has been linked with increased hospital admissions (HA) for schizophrenia. However, evidence is inconclusive about the added effect of multi-day exposure to high-level PM concentration on schizophrenia. This study aims to evaluate the durational effect of PM air pollution wave on schizophrenia.
Method
Data on daily HA for schizophrenia, PM (PM2.5 and PM10) and meteorological variables over the period of 2014–2017 was collected in Jining, Shandong, China. Air pollution wave of PM was defined as ≥2 or ≥3 or ≥4 consecutive days with PM concentration ≥90th or ≥92.5th or ≥95th or ≥97.5th percentiles, respectively. A time-series Poisson regression model with duration as the variable of interest was used to evaluate the associations of PM air pollution wave with HA for schizophrenia.
Results
A total of 14650 hospital admissions for schizophrenia were identified. Under various air pollution wave definitions, both PM2.5 and PM10 had significant adverse effects on schizophrenia HA. PM2.5 wave defined as ≥2 consecutive days with concentration ≥90th, ≥92.5th, ≥95th and ≥97.5th percentile was associated with 4.8% (2.0%–7.6%), 4.9% (1.9%–7.9%), 5.5% (2.0%–9.2%), and 7.6% (2.9%–12.6%) increase of HA for schizophrenia at lag 6. PM2.5 waves defined as ≥3 consecutive days with concentration ≥90th, ≥92.5th, ≥95th and ≥97.5th percentile respectively corresponded to 5.0% (2.3%–7.8%), 5.1% (1.9%–8.4%), 6.9% (3.0%–10.8%) and 12.0% (5.3%–19.1%) increases in HA for schizophrenia at lag 6. The most significant associations were observed on the sixth day in different lag models.
Conclusions
PM air pollution wave was associated with increased risk of hospital admissions for schizophrenia, with stronger associations among married and female patients.},

Our study aimed to investigate the effects of several major air pollutants on HFMD in the warm and cold seasons in central China. A Poisson Generalized additive model (GAM) was used to assess the association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and the incidence of HFMD at Wuhan, China during 20152016. Daily cases of HFMD were extracted from the infectious disease surveillance systems of Hubei provincial center for disease control and prevention (Hubei CDC). Data on air pollution, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ground-level ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 10 $\mu$m (PM10), and PM with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) were obtained from 10 national air quality monitoring stations in Wuhan. We found that the association between air pollution and HFMD was most pronounced at lag days 10 and 11. The results of the single-pollutant model show that the associations of SO2, NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5 with HFMD were all statistically significant. The results of the multi-pollutant model showed that NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5 are reduced after excluding the confounding of co-pollutants. The seasonal analysis showed that the effect of air pollution in the cold season was higher than in the warm season. Our research provides more evidence related to air pollution and HFMD, and helps policy makers to develop regulations for the prevention and control of the disease.},

abstract = {China's government has announced the mandatory, nationwide use of ethanol blended gasoline fuels (E10, namely, 10% ethanol blend) by 2020. It is necessary to assess the air quality and health impacts of E10 gasoline in China. This study compares two E10 gasoline fuels, ELA (lower content of aromatics) and ELO (lower content of olefins), assuming 100% utilization in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) and Yangtze-River Delta (YRD) regions in 2030. We found that reduced emissions of primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and increased emissions of NOX could be achieved by using both E10 fuels. For nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC), on-road emissions would be increased by 8% under Scenario ELA and reduced by 3% under Scenario ELO because of the different impacts of the two E10 fuels on evaporation. By using an atmospheric chemical transport model, the annual average reduction in PM2.5 concentrations is estimated to reach nearly 0.2 $\mu$g m−3 in the urban areas under Scenario ELO, while the benefit of the decline of the ambient PM2.5 concentrations is smaller under Scenario ELA (<0.1 $\mu$g m−3). E10 fuels could increase ambient NO2 concentrations, and the greatest increase, up to 0.4–0.5 $\mu$g m−3 (0.7%–1.5%), is estimated to occur in Beijing. For ozone (O3) formation, the impacts of the two E10 fuels are different. Scenario ELA is estimated to increase ambient O3 concentrations while Scenario ELO would help reduce O3, both exhibiting VOC-limited characteristics. We further found that positive health impacts could be achieved by using E10 fuels based on the estimated mortality attributable to long-term exposures to ambient PM2.5 and O3. 1015 (679–1258) and 790 (522–991) premature deaths are estimated to be avoided in the BTH and YRD regions, respectively, by using the ELO fuel. Future analysis is recommended to investigate detailed species-resolved emissions, more fuel formulas and future vehicle technologies.},

However, knowledge on exposure to ambient unregulated air pollutants such as black carbon (BC) and ultrafine particles (UFP) among the Chinese population, especially among urban high school students who may have highly variable time-activity patterns, is scarce. To address this, the personal exposures to BC and UFP of high school students (aged 17 to 18) in Chengdu, China were measured at 1-min intervals via portable samplers. Monitoring lasted for 2 consecutive 24-h periods with days classified as “school days” or “non-school days”. Time-activity diaries and measurements were combined to explore spatial, temporal, and behavioral factors that contribute to different exposure profiles. The overall geometric means of BC and UFP were 3.60 $\mu$g/m3 and 1.83 × 104p/cm3, respectively with notable spatiotemporal variation in exposures observed. In general, the household and transport microenvironments were the predominant contributors to total BC (74.5%) and UFP (36.5%) exposure. However, the outdoor public microenvironment was found to have significantly higher overall average levels of BC than the household and transport microenvironments (p < 0.001) while also presenting the greatest exposure dose intensity (EDI – a measure of exposure in a microenvironment in proportion to time spent in that environment) of 4.79. The largest overall average level of UFP occurred in the indoor public microenvironment followed by transport. The outdoor public microenvironment also presented the greatest EDI of UFP (4.17). This study shows notable spatiotemporal variety in exposure patterns and will inform future exposure and population health studies. The high EDI outdoors may mean that health positive activities, such as exercise, may be being undermined by ambient pollution.},

abstract = {In health-oriented air pollution control, it is vital to rank the contributions of different emission sources to the health risks posed by hazardous components in airborne fine particulate matters (PM2.5), such as trace metals. Towards this end, we investigated the PM2.5-associated metals in two densely populated regions of China, the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) regions, across land-use gradients. Using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, we performed an integrated source apportionment to quantify the contributions of the major source categories underlying metal-induced health risks with information on the bioaccessibility (using simulated lung fluid) and speciation (using synchrotron-based techniques) of metals. The results showed that the particulate trace metal profiles reflected the land-use gradient within each region, with the highest concentrations of anthropogenically enriched metals at the industrial sites in the study regions. The resulting carcinogenic risk that these elements posed was higher in the YRD than in the PRD. Chromium was the dominant contributor to the total excessive cancer risks posed by metals while manganese accounted for a large proportion of non-carcinogenic risks. An elevated contribution from industrial emissions was found in the YRD, while traffic emissions and non-traffic combustion (the burning of coal/waste/biomass) were the common dominant sources of cancer and non-cancer risks posed by metals in both regions. Moreover, the risk-oriented source apportionment of metals did not mirror the mass concentration-based one, suggesting the insufficiency of the latter to inform emission mitigation in favor of public health. While providing region-specific insights into the quantitative contribution of major source categories to the health risks of PM2.5-associated trace metals, our study highlighted the need to consider the health protection goal-based source apportionment and emission mitigation in supplement to the current mass concentration-based framework.},

Effects of air pollutants are related to oxidative stress which is also linked to the pathogenesis of dementia including Alzheimer's and related diseases.
Objective
We assessed associations between exposure to air pollutants and the onset of dementia; the association with the distance between residence and major roads was also assessed for the island of Montreal.
Methods
We created an open cohort of adults aged 65 years and older starting in 2000 and ending in 2012 in the province of Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada using linked medico-administrative databases. New cases of dementia were defined based on a validated algorithm. Annual residential levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particles (PM2.5) at residential levels were estimated for each year of follow up using estimates based on satellite images and ground air monitoring data. Hazard ratios (HRs) were assessed with Extended (time dependent exposure) Cox models with age as the time axis and stratified for sex, for the annual exposure level at each residential address. Models were adjusted for the calendar year, area-wide social and material deprivation indexes and for NO2 or PM2.5; they were also indirectly adjusted for smoking.
Results
1,807,133 persons (13,242,270 person-years) were followed and 199,826 developed dementia. From models (adjusted for calendar year, social and material deprivation indexes), HRs for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in time-varying exposure to NO2 (IQR 13.26 ppb), PM2.5 (IQR 3.90 $\mu$g/m³), and distance to major roads (IQR 150 m, in Montreal only), were 1.005 (CI 95% 0.994–1.017), 1.016 (CI 95% 1.003–1.028) and 0.969 (CI 95% 0.958–0.980), respectively.

Individual and neighbourhood-scale socioeconomic characteristics modify associations between exposure to air pollution and mortality. The role of stress, which may integrate effects of social and environmental exposures on health, is unknown. We examined whether an individual's perspective on their own well-being, as assessed using self-rated measures of stress and health, modifies the pollutant-mortality relationship.
Methods
The Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS)-mortality cohort includes respondents from surveys administered between 2001 and 2012 linked to vital statistics and postal codes from 1981 until 2016. Annual fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) exposure estimates were attached to a sample of cohort members aged 30–89 years (n = 398,300 respondents/3,848,400 person-years). We examined whether self-rated stress, distress, mental health, and general health modified associations between long-term exposure to each pollutant (three-year moving average with one-year lag) and non-accidental mortality using Cox survival models, adjusted for individual- (i.e. socioeconomic and behavioural) and neighbourhood-scale covariates.
Results
In fully-adjusted models, the relationship between exposure to pollutants and mortality was stronger among those with poor self-rated mental health, including a significant difference for NO2 (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.15, 95% CI 1.06–1.25 per IQR) compared to those with very good/excellent mental health (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.08; Cochran's Q = 4.01; p < 0.05). Poor self-rated health was similarly associated with higher pollutant-associated HRs, but only in unadjusted models. Stress and distress did not modify pollutant-mortality associations.
Conclusions
Poor self-rated mental and general health were associated with increased mortality attributed to exposure to ambient pollutants.},

The combined effects of physical activity and air pollution exposure on vascular function are insufficiently understood, particularly after the inhalation of a $\beta$2-agonist, a vasodilating agent.
Objective
To assess the micro- and macrovascular response to physical activity after $\beta$2-agonist use while breathing diesel exhaust (DE) in individuals with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

On four exposure visits, eighteen adults inhaled either 400 $\mu$g of the $\beta$2-agonist salbutamol or placebo before resting for 60 min, followed by a 30-min cycling bout. During rest and cycling, participants inhaled filtered air (FA) or DE (300 $\mu$g/m3 of PM2.5).

The exposure to DE had no effect on CRAE (FA-DE difference at T2: 0.46 $\mu$m (−0.02, 0.92 $\mu$m); p = 0.790; FA-DE difference at T3: 1.76 $\mu$m (1.36, 2.16 $\mu$m), p = 0.213) and CRVE (FA-DE difference at T2: 0.26 $\mu$m (−0.35, 0.88 $\mu$m), p = 0.906; FA-DE difference at T3: 0.55 $\mu$m (0.05, 1.06 $\mu$m), p = 0.750). Compared to T1, systolic BP was decreased at T2 by 2.5 mmHg (2.8, 2.3 mmHg, p = 0.047), independent of inhaled exposure. Heart rate at T2 was significantly increased by 3 bpm (2, 3 bpm, p = 0.025) after the DE-exposure when compared to FA.
Discussion
Acute physical activity induces a vasodilatory response in the micro- and macrovasculature in healthy adults by increasing CRAE and CRVE, and by reducing systolic BP post exercise, despite breathing DE. The DE-associated increase in HR might be indicative of an increased sympathetic response to physical activity while breathing DE.},

abstract = {Research has indicated that the legal maximum annual-average concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for safe long-term exposure in the European Union and United Kingdom (40 $\mu$g/m3) may not offer adequate protection and that a lower value may be needed. At the same time concerns have been raised in the UK about government methods to assess NO2 for the purposes of compliance with the legal limit. It is suggested that the national assessment underestimates levels of the pollutant and that local authority assessments, which in several cases find higher NO2 levels, are a more accurate reflection of pollution. This research used Brighton and Hove – which is deemed compliant with NO2 limits by the national assessment – as a case study to inform these debates. Using local authority pollution data, the research found that: up to 15.9% (95% CI 9.4%–21.9%) of mortality in the examined area, which approximately corresponds to central Brighton, can be attributed to long-term exposure to 2016 levels of NO2; up to 13.9% (95% CI 8.2%−19.2%) of mortality in this area can be attributed to legal concentrations of the annual-average limit; and up to 3% of mortality in the area examined can be attributed to the portion of 2016 concentrations above the 40 $\mu$gNO2/m3 annual average limit. These results suggest the current EU and UK limit value for long-term exposure to NO2 may not be adequate to protect public health. The findings also indicate the UK government assessment does not identify all the local NO2 hotspots contributing to premature deaths.},

Daily counts of hospital admission for ischemic stroke were collected in 5 hospitals in China during November 2013 to October 2015. Daily concentrations of PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 were collected in 5 cities where the hospitals were located. A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to examine the hospital-specific PM-ischemic stroke association after controlling for potential confounders. Then the effect estimates were pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis. A total of 68,122 hospital admissions for ischemic stroke were identified from 5 hospitals during the study period. The pooled results showed that exposures to PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 were significantly associated with increased hospital admission for ischemic stroke on the current day and previous 1 day. The RRs (relative risk associated with per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in each pollutant) and 95%CIs (confidence intervals) for the cumulative effects of PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 on ischemic stroke during lag 0–1 days were 1.014 (1.005, 1.0023), 1.007 (1.000, 1.014) and 1.005 (1.001, 1.009), respectively. In total, 3.5%, 3.6% and 4.1% of hospital admissions for ischemic stroke could be attributable to PM1, PM2.5 and PM10, respectively.

Few studies have examined the effects of industrial, fixed-site sources of air pollution on lung inflammation in nearby residents. We investigated the effects of short-term exposure to ambient air near a steel plant on the fractional exhaled concentration of nitric oxide (FeNO), a measure of airway inflammation, in healthy volunteers.
Methods
A cross-over study design was used. Fifty-nine non-smoking participants (mean age 24 years) were randomly assigned to each of two 5-day exposure scenarios: breathing ambient air adjacent to a steel plant or 5 km away at a college campus site. FeNO and on-site air pollutants were measured daily. Mixed effects linear regression models were used for data analysis, adjusting for sex, temperature, humidity and day of week.
Results
Compared with the college site, PM 2.5, ultrafine PM, SO2, NO2 and CO levels were significantly greater near the steel plant. FeNO was 15.3% (95% CI, 6.6%, 24.8%) higher near the plant compared to the college site.
Conclusions
Exposure to ambient air near a steel plant was associated with increased airway inflammation as measured by exhaled nitric oxide.},

Here we evaluate premature deaths attributable to chronic and acute exposure to ambient PM2.5 at different scales in China over 2013–2017 with an air quality model at 5 km resolution and integrated exposure-response methods. We estimate that 1,210,000 (95% Confidence Interval: 720,000–1,750,000) premature deaths annually are attributable to chronic exposure to PM2.5 pollution. Chongqing exhibits the largest chronic per capita mortality (1.4‰) among all provinces. A total of 116,000 (64,000–170,000) deaths annually are attributable to acute exposure during pollution episodes over the period, with Hubei province showing the highest acute per capita mortality (0.15‰). We also find that in urban areas premature deaths are 520,000 (320,000–760,000) due to chronic and 55,000 (3,000–81,000) due to acute exposure, respectively. At a provincial level, the annual mean PM2.5 concentration varies by ±20% due to interannual variability in meteorology, and PM2.5–attributable chronic mortality varies by ±8%, and by >±5% and ±1% at a national level. Meteorological variability shows larger impacts on interannual variations in acute risks than that in chronic exposure at both provincial (>±20%) and national (±4%) levels. These findings emphasize that tighter controls of PM2.5 and precursor emissions are urgently needed, particularly under unfavorable meteorological conditions in China.},

Results obtained from two-way fixed effects models indicate that average life expectancy is negatively associated with both average working hours and fine particulate matter concentration. Findings also indicate clear moderating relationships: the negative association between life expectancy and working hours is amplified as PM2.5 concentration increases, and the negative relationship between life expectancy and fine particulate matter concentration is amplified when average working hours increase.

In this study, the levels and types of PM2.5–bound EPFRs present in Nanjing, a mega–city in China, were analyzed. PM2.5–bound EPFRs were found to mainly be a mixture of carbon– and oxygen–centered radicals. The concentration of PM2.5–bound EPFRs ranged from 2.78 × 1012 to 1.72 × 1013 spins m−3, with an average value of 7.61 × 1012 spins m−3. The half–life of the PM2.5–bound EPFRs was calculated to be an average of 83.5 days when stored at room temperature, with only weak correlations observed between EPFRs and conventional air pollutants (NO2, O3, CO and PM2.5)/PM2.5–bound transition metals (Cu, Zn, Cr, Mn, V, Cd, and Ni) and significant correlations between EPFRs and SO2/PM2.5–bound Fe. PM2.5–bound EPFRs can induce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both water and a H2O2 solution, which are used to simulate lung solution of a healthy person and patient, respectively. Therefore, PM2.5–bound EPFRs can lead to potential oxidative stress in humans. Overall, PM2.5–bound EPFRs show an obvious temporal variation and can pose potential health risks to humans via the induction of ROS in the lung solution.},

This study develops an air pollution source reduction strategy that apportions health risk among different emission sources by combining the receptor model and human health risk assessment technique. The goal is to identify emission source of PM2.5 that have the greatest impact on human health. We establish a PM2.5 sampling station in Sha-Lu, Taiwan. Five PM2.5 pollution sources were identified in this study. They are steel industry, residual oil combustion, road dust and traffic, coal-fired power plant, and glass production industry. The results of health risk assessment indicated that the metal contributes the most cancer risk is arsenic, followed by hexavalent chromium. The emissions of these two metals are closely related to coal-fired power plant. We suggested that the power plants should use coal with a low As and Cr content of coal in order to reduce the health risk associated with exposure to PM2.5. The limitation of this study is that only a small fraction of compounds was measured in the samples. However, this study demonstrates that an analysis of the degree to which emission sources contribute to health risks is a useful technique.

We aimed to examine the associations of air pollution concentration with blood glucose among pregnant women. We identified 37,383 women who were pregnant from hospital records from January 2013 to July 2017. We used generalized linear models to estimate adverse associations of air pollution on the glucose challenge test (GCT) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) blood glucose levels among pregnant women in the second trimester on lag days 1–7, adjusting for a number of demographics, health and socioeconomic covariates. An IQR increase in PM2.5 concentration during the second trimester was associated with 2.09% (7-day lag, 95% CI: 1.62%, 2.57%) higher GCT blood glucose levels; the corresponding figures for PM10, NO2 and CO were 3.99% (7-day lag, 95% CI: 3.28%, 4.71%), 7.40% (6-day lag, 95% CI: 6.41%, 8.39%), and 4.23% (4-day lag, 95% CI: 3.75%, 4.71%), respectively. For PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 concentrations, significant associations were observed among women with older age, overweight/obesity, and lower education level. However, pregnant women with lower BMI were more susceptible to higher CO-related GCT blood glucose levels. Participants who worked as public servants and technicians may be less susceptible to the effects of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and CO than women with the other three occupations considered. Too much or too little exercise frequency was susceptible to the adverse effects of air pollution in pregnant women (higher blood glucose levels). Our estimates for air pollutants and OGTT were generally consistent with the corresponding $\beta$ values for GCT blood glucose. In the present study, women had higher blood glucose levels when exposed to higher residential PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and CO during their pregnancy. Women with higher BMI and lower education levels were more susceptible to the adverse effects of ambient air pollution.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to air pollution is associated with increased blood pressure (BP) in adults and children. Some evidence suggests that air pollution exposure during the prenatal period may contribute to adverse cardiorenal health later in life. Here we apply a distributed lag model (DLM) approach to identify critical windows that may underlie the association between prenatal particulate matter ≤ 2.5 $\mu$m in diameter (PM2.5) exposure and children's BP at ages 4–6 years.
Methods
Participants included 537 mother-child dyads enrolled in the Programming Research in Obesity, GRowth Environment, and Social Stress (PROGRESS) longitudinal birth cohort study based in Mexico City. Prenatal daily PM2.5 exposure was estimated using a validated satellite-based spatio-temporal model and BP was measured using the automated Spacelabs system with a sized cuff. We used distributed lag models (DLMs) to examine associations between daily PM2.5 exposure and systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), adjusting for child's age, sex and BMI, as well as maternal education, preeclampsia and indoor smoking report during the second and third trimester, seasonality and average postnatal year 1 PM2.5 exposure.
Results
We found that PM2.5 exposure between weeks 11–32 of gestation (days 80–226) was significantly associated with children's increased SBP. Similarly, PM2.5 exposure between weeks 9–25 of gestation (days 63–176) was significantly associated with increased DBP. To place this into context, a constant 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 sustained throughout this critical window would predict a cumulative increase of 2.6 mmHg (CI: 0.5, 4.6) in SBP and 0.88 mmHg (CI: 0.1, 1.6) in DBP at ages 4–6 years. In a stratified analysis by sex, this association persisted in boys but not in girls.
Conclusions
Second and third trimester PM2.5 exposure may increase children's BP in early life. Further work investigating PM2.5 exposure with BP trajectories later in childhood will be important to understanding cardiorenal trajectories that may predict adult disease. Our results underscore the importance of reducing air pollution exposure among susceptible populations, including pregnant women.},

We included 105 children aged 4–13 years from a panel study conducted in Wuhan, China with up to 3 repeated visits across 3 seasons from October 9, 2017 to June 1, 2018. We measured personal real-time PM2.5 exposure concentration continuously for 72 h preceding each round of health examinations that included serum creatinine and cytokines. Linear mixed-effects models were performed to estimate the effects of PM2.5 on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over various lag times, and a mediation analysis was applied for the role of cytokines in association between PM2.5 and eGFR. Results showed that personal exposure to PM2.5 was dose-responsive related to decreased eGFR within lag 2 days. The effect was the strongest at lag 0 day with estimation of −1.69% [95% confidence interval (CI): -2.27%, −1.10%] in eGFR by a 10-$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5, and reached peak at lag 3 h, then declined over time. Such inverse relationships were more evident among children aged 4–6 years, or boys or those who lived proximity to major roadways <300 m. Notably, eGFR still held on to decrease even when PM2.5 was below Class II Chinese ambient air quality standard at lag 0 day. Moreover, the effect of PM2.5 on eGFR was significantly reduced in children with high and medium levels of serum chemokine ligand 27 (CCL27), but not in those with low CCL27. Furthermore, CCL27 was positively relevant to PM2.5, and mediated proportion of CCL27 ranged from 3.75% to 6.61% in relations between PM2.5 and decreased eGFR over various lag times. In summary, short-term PM2.5 exposure might be dose-responsive associated with reduced eGFR whereby a mechanism partly involving CCL27 among healthy children.},

PM10 estimates were generated from daily citywide averages for 1216 pregnant women from three subcohorts of the Early Life Exposures in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants study using data from the Mexico City Outdoor Air Monitoring Network. Among a subset of participants (N = 620), E-DII scores were calculated using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Cox Proportional Hazards models were run for select periods during pregnancy and entire pregnancy averages for E-DII and PM10. We assessed for potential non-linear associations using natural splines.
Results
In adjusted models, PM10 exposure was associated with increased risks of PTB for a range of values (58–72 $\mu$g/m3) during the second trimester, while negative associations were seen during the second (≥74 $\mu$g/m3) and third trimesters (55–65 $\mu$g/m3). Analyses conducted using distributed lag models for periods closer to delivery (max lag = 90) did not show negative associations between PM10 exposure and preterm birth, and indeed positive significant associations were observed (estimates and figures). E-DII was not associated with PTB and there was no evidence of effect modification by infant sex. There was no evidence of interaction between PM10 and E-DII and the risk of preterm birth.
Discussion
Associations between PM10 and PTB in Mexico City varied over time and across levels of PM10. Our findings of negative associations in the second and third trimesters, which are contrary to the hypothesized relationship between PM10 and PTB, may be due to a number of factors, including live birth bias and the exposure period evaluated. Differences in results for the periods evaluated suggest that PM10 from shorter exposure windows may play a more proximal role in initiating preterm labor.},

abstract = {Although studies have assessed the associations between prenatal exposure with fine particulate matter (PM) with birth weight, few have investigated the effect of PM1 exposure and identified the susceptible exposure window. Additionally, a baby boom occurred after China implemented the universal two-child policy, but whether the effects of PM are modified by birth order remains unknown. The objective of this study was to estimate the effects of prenatal exposure to PM (PM2.5 and PM1) on birth weight, identify the susceptible exposure windows, and assess the modifying effect of birth order on the effects of PM exposure. All participants were selected from the Prenatal Environment and Offspring Health (PEOH) cohort conducted since 2016 in Guangzhou, China. A spatiotemporal land–use-regression (STLUR) model was used to estimate a pregnant woman's weekly PM2.5 exposure, and a generalized additive model (GAM) was used to estimate each PM1 exposure. A distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was applied to assess the exposure–lag-response associations between weekly PM exposure and birth weight. The sample included 4086 pregnant women. The results showed that maternal exposure to PM2.5 and PM1 during the 15th to 24th and 16th to 24th gestational weeks were associated with lower birth weight, the strongest association was observed in the 19th week, during which each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increment in PM2.5 and PM1 was associated with a 1.47 g (95% CI: 2.49 g, 0.44 g) and 1.58 g (95%CI: 2.74 g, 0.41 g) decrease in birth weight, respectively. Compared with the first-born neonates, greater effects of PM2.5 and PM1 exposure on birth weight were observed among the second-born neonates in the 15th to 21st and 15 h to 22nd gestational weeks. Further studies tracking the health of the second-born children are warranted because they may be more sensitive to environmental factors than the first-born children.},

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of short-term exposure to PM2.5 on blood pressure in office workers in Beijing, China. A total of 4801 individuals aged 18–60 years underwent an annual medical examination between 2013 and 2017. Levels of air pollutants were obtained from 35 fixed monitoring stations and correlated with the employment location of each participant to predict personal exposure via kriging interpolation. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate the changes in blood pressure associated with PM2.5 exposure at various lag times. After adjusting for personal characteristics and other potential confounders, each interquartile range increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 0.413-mmHg (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.252–0.573), 0.171-mmHg (95% CI: 0.053–0.288), 0.278-mmHg (95% CI: 0.152–0.404), and 0.241-mmHg (95% CI: 0.120–0.362) increase in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and mean arterial pressure, respectively (p < 0.05). Men, individuals previously diagnosed with hypertension, and subjects working in the northern districts of Beijing had larger changes in blood pressure, and the effect sizes were 0.477-mmHg (95% CI: 0.286–0.669), 0.851-mmHg (95% CI: 0.306–1.397, and 0.672-mmHg (95% CI: 0.405–0.940). The findings suggested that exposure to PM2.5 had adverse effects on blood pressure, especially among males and hypertensive patients.},

abstract = {In the early 2000s, the Pearl River Delta (PRD) became one of the earliest regions in China to implement a stringent control policy on air pollution emission. In particular, during the 11th Five Year Plan (FYP) and 12th FYP (i.e., 2006–2015), the emission control measures were executed intensively and efficiently under the supervision of law enforcement authorities. These measures helped substantially reduce the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration over this region. Hence, it is now important to determine how the decrease in PM2.5 concentration influenced the exposure condition and health burdens in the PRD region during 2006–2015. In this study, the exposure and mortality apportionment of PM2.5 under both 2006 and 2015 emission scenarios were investigated. The simulated population-weighted PM2.5 concentration was found to be lower under the 2015 emission scenario compared with that under the 2006 scenario. The average reductions in simulated PM2.5 exposure concentrations (population-weighted average) for Guangzhou, Dongguan, Foshan, and Shenzhen were 32.7, 27.0, 25.3, and 24.1 $\mu$g/m3, respectively. After excluding the meteorological variations, a difference of approximately 16,400 (95% CI: 9,100, 22,800) in the number of simulated premature deaths was obtained after the 10-year efforts for emission control and industrial restructuring. Among the five major anthropogenic emissions (mobile, area, power plant, marine vessel, and industrial point emissions), the control of mobile emissions was found to be the most relevant to the estimated health benefits. The calculated economic benefits from controlling mobile emissions reached 30,300 (21,600, 37,100) million USD in 2015. In contrast, the mortality related to area emissions turned out to be higher under the 2015 emission scenario. The difference between 2006 and 2015 meteorological scenarios could substantially influence the simulated exposure concentration in each month. However, the impact of the meteorological factors was found to be limited when the exposure concentrations of the 4 months were averaged. Further, 26,700 (18,500, 33,400) premature deaths difference was calculated after the PM2.5 concentration over the PRD region reached the Air Quality Guideline standard. Therefore, more efforts, including the control of area emissions and the enhancement of regional cooperation (e.g., reducing industrial emission consistently and systematically in southern China), are crucial further to reduce the PM2.5 concentrations in the PRD region and improve the living conditions for the residents.},

abstract = {Background
Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been associated with breast cancer specific mortality, particularly for women with Stage I cancer. We examined the biological pathways that are perturbed by PM2.5 exposures by analyzing gene expression measurements from breast tissue specimens.
Methods
The Nurses' Health Studies (NHS and NHSII) are prospective cohorts with archival breast tissue specimens from breast cancer cases. Global gene expression data were ascertained with the Affymetrix Glue Human Transcriptome Array 3.0. PM2.5 was estimated using spatio-temporal models linked to participants' home addresses. All analyses were performed separately in tumor (n = 591) and adjacent-normal (n = 497) samples, and stratified by estrogen receptor (ER) status and stage. We used multivariable linear regression, gene-set enrichment analyses (GSEA), and the least squares kernel machine (LSKM) to assess whether 3-year cumulative average pre-diagnosis PM2.5 exposure was associated with breast-tissue gene expression pathways among predominately Stage I and II women (90.7%) and postmenopausal (81.2%) women. Replication samples (tumor, n = 245; adjacent-normal, n = 165) were measured on Affymetrix Human Transcriptome Array (HTA 2.0).
Results
Overall, no pathways in the tumor area were significantly associated with PM2.5 exposure. Among 272 adjacent-normal samples from Stage I ER-positive women, PM2.5 was associated with perturbations in the oxidative phosphorylation, protein secretion, and mTORC1 signaling pathways (GSEA and LSKM p-values <0.05); however, results were not replicated in a small set of replication samples (n = 80).
Conclusions
PM2.5 was generally not associated with breast tissue gene expression though was suggested to perturb oxidative phosphorylation and regulation of proteins and cellular signaling in adjacent-normal breast tissue. More research is needed on the biological role of PM2.5 that influences breast tumor progression.},

Health risk estimations attributable to PM2.5 from ischemic heart disease and lung cancer along with all causes were calculated by applying the cause-specific mortality rates for Turkey and Iran for the year 2016. According to dust and sea-salt removed satellite-derived PM2.5, mortality estimations of 36967 in Turkey and 34491 in Iran were estimated by all causes. Meanwhile, estimations of 40583 in Turkey and 34153 in Iran were found using ground PM2.5 observations for provinces with monitoring stations. Province-based estimations were obtained with better spatially resolved PM2.5 concentrations. Estimations using ground observations were higher than ones using satellite-derived PM2.5 for Turkey, but similar for Iran, even without national coverage. However, estimations with all composition satellite-based PM2.5 were significantly higher in Iran than Turkey. Values estimated in this study were found to be higher than global studies for both countries.},

abstract = {Direct evidence about associations between fine particles (PM2.5) components and the corresponding PM2.5 bioreactivity at the individual level is limited. We conducted a panel study with repeated personal measurements involving 56 healthy residents in Hong Kong. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels were measured from these subjects. Out of 56 subjects, 27 (48.2%) participated in concurrent outdoor, indoor, and personal PM2.5 monitoring. Organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), particle bound-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and phthalates were analyzed. Alteration in cell viability, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and 8-isoprostane by 50 $\mu$g/mL PM2.5 extracts was determined in A549 cells in vitro. Moderate heterogeneities were shown in PM2.5 exposures and the corresponding PM2.5 bioreactivity across different sample types. Associations between the analyzed components and PM2.5 bioreactivity were assessed using the multiple regression models. Toxicological results revealed that indoor and personal exposure to OC as well as PAH compounds and their derivatives (e.g., Alkyl-PAHs, Oxy-PAHs) induced cell viability reduction and increase in levels of LDH, IL-6, and 8-isoprostane. Overall, OC in personal exposure played a dominant role in PM2.5-induced bioreactivity. Subsequently, we examined the associations of FeNO with IL-6 and 8-isoprostane levels using mixed-effects models. The results showed that per interquartile change in IL-6 and 8-isoprostane were associated with a 6.4% (p < 0.01) and 11.1% (p < 0.01) increase in FeNO levels, respectively. Our study explored the toxicological properties of chemical components in PM2.5 exposure, which suggested that residential indoors and personal OC and PAHs should be of great concern for human health. These findings indicated that further studies in inflammation and oxidative stress-related illnesses due to particle exposure would benefit from the assessment of in vitro PM2.5 bioreactivity.},

abstract = {Background
The linearity of concentration-response (C-R) curve between ambient ozone (O3) concentration and mortality has been controversial. The aim of the present analysis was to examine the C-R curve between O3 concentration and mortality with a causal framework approach.
Methods
We extracted data of hourly meteorology, hourly O3 concentration and daily non-accidental mortality in Seoul from 2001 to 2009. We divided the dataset into two, odd-number (training set) and even-number years (testing set). Using the training set, we constructed a prediction model from hourly O3 concentration with support vector regression estimating the daily variations of mean O3 concentration caused by sun irradiation, wind speed and direction, controlling temperature, barometric pressure and temporal trend. With this model we predicted variance of daily O3 from the testing set, thus creating an instrumental variable. We analyzed the association between the instrumental variable and daily mortality. We also analyzed the association according to the quartiles of daily mean O3 concentration to examine the linearity of the association.
Results
The instrumental variable was significantly and negatively associated with daily mortality in the linear model. In the stratified analysis, the negative slope was observed in the lowest quartile and the negative slope of the association diminished as the quartile increased, and the slope became positive over the 3rd quartile (O3 > 23.3 ppb). The interaction between quartiles and instrumental variable was significant (P = 0.0108).
Conclusion
We observed unequal effect of exposure to ambient O3 concentration on mortality according to the different ranges of daily mean O3 concentration with a causal framework approach.},

We aimed to examine molecular-level inflammatory and oxidative stress responses to personal air pollutant exposure. Fifty-three healthy adults aged 22–52 were measured three times for their blood inflammatory cytokines and urinary malondialdehyde (MDA, an oxidative stress biomarker) within 2 consecutive months. Pollutant concentrations monitored indoors and outdoors were combined with the time-activity data to calculate personal O3, PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 exposures averaged over 12 h, 24 h, 1 week, and 2 weeks, respectively, prior to biospecimen collection. Inflammatory cytokines and MDA were associated with pollutant exposures using linear mixed-effects models controlling for various covariates. After adjusting for a co-pollutant, we found that concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines were significantly and negatively associated with 12-h O3 exposures and significantly but positively associated with 2-week O3 exposures. We also found significant and positive associations of proinflammatory cytokines with 12-h and 24-h NO2 exposures, respectively. However, we did not find clear associations of PM2.5 and SO2 exposure with proinflammatory cytokines and with MDA. The removal of an O3-generating electrostatic precipitator in the mechanical ventilation systems of the offices and residences of the subjects was associated with significant decreases in IL-1$\beta$, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, and TNF-$\alpha$. These findings suggest that exposure to O3 for different time durations may affect systemic inflammatory responses in different ways.},

Indonesia is facing serious air pollution. However, very few studies have been conducted to examine the health risks of air pollution in Indonesia, particularly for adolescents.
Objective
To assess the association between long-term exposure to ambient particles with a diameter of <2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in adolescents.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 482 adolescents aged 14–18 years in Yogyakarta, Indonesia in 2016. We finally included 469 (97.30%) participants who had no missing data for data analysis. We collected individual data on socio-demographics, behavioral habits, and health information through standardized questionnaires. Satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations from 2013 to 2016 were assigned based on participants' residential addresses. The association between PM2.5 and FPG was examined using a generalized linear regression model while FPG was modeled as a continuous variable. An ordered logistic regression model was used to assess the relationship between PM2.5 and FPG categories.
Results
Every 1 $\mu$g/m³ increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 0.34 mg/dL [95 confidence interval (95% CI): 0.08 mg/dL, 0.59 mg/dL] increase in FPG levels. Comparing with the low FPG level (under 86 mg/dL), every 1 $\mu$g/m³ increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 10.20% (95% CI: 1.60%, 19.80%) increase in the odds of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (100–125 mg/dL). Stratified analyses indicated greater effects on participants with hypertension [odds ratio (OR) = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.57] and those had higher physical activities (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.57). Adolescents' sex, obesity status and different cutoff points of FPG did not modify the association between the exposure to PM2.5 and FPG levels.
Conclusion
Long-term exposure to PM2.5 was associated with increased FPG levels in Indonesian non-diabetic adolescents.},

abstract = {Since ambient particulate matter (APM) is closely related to cardiovascular damage with mitochondria being its potential targets, this study was designed to explore the impact of APM on mitochondrial homeostasis, especially on mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis in human vascular endothelial cells, using a kind of standard material, PM SRM1648a. As a result, internalized particles lead to mitochondrial dysfunction in EA.hy926 human endothelial cells, including mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) overproduction, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) reduction and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) inhibition, coupled with additional release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the cytosol. Moreover, morphological and structural changes in mitochondria are observed in response to PM SRM1648a. In that aspect, according to the evidence of shorter fragmented mitochondria dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, along with aberrant upregulation of fission-related mRNAs/proteins, the mitochondria exhibit a fission phenotype shifting from intact reticular network to fragmentized punctate shapes. Mechanistically, PM SRM1648a facilitates phosphorylation of DRP1 at Ser616 in HUVECs, and triggers its dephosphorylation at Ser637 residue in both EA.hy926 and HUVECs, which are supportive events for mitochondrial fission during particle exposure. Additionally, suppression of a master energy modulator, PGC-1$\alpha$, reveals that PM SRM1648a has the ability to impair mitochondrial biogenesis. Collectively, it could be well concluded that PM SRM1648a interferes with the equilibrium of mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis, which is likely to play a pivotal role in mitochondrial dysfunction driven by particles, eventually contributing to endothelial cell damage. Of note, it is more reasonable to conduct risk assessment from both cellular level and subcellular structures, among which mitochondria-targeted toxicity supplements more comprehensive understanding of APM inducible vascular toxicity.},

abstract = {PM2.5 exposure aggravates type 2 diabetes, in which inflammatory factors play an important role. In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms responsible for aggravating diabetes after PM2.5 exposure, and study the roles of inflammatory factors in insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes. Our study indicated that short-time PM2.5 exposure enhances insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic rats and significantly raises inflammatory factors, including IL-6, TNF-$\alpha$, and MCP-1, in lungs. However, we found that of these inflammatory factors only IL-6 levels are elevated in blood, liver, adipose tissue, and macrophages, but not in skeletal muscle. IL-6 induced activation of the STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in liver, but not other downstream pathways including STAT1, ERK1/2, and PI3K. Both STAT3 inhibition and IL-6 neutralization effectively alleviated the disorders of glucose metabolism after PM2.5 exposure. Taken together, this suggests that the systemic increase in IL-6 may play an important role in the deterioration of the type 2 diabetes via IL-6/STAT3/SOCS3 pathway in liver after short-time exposure to PM2.5. Besides, we unexpectedly found a stronger resistance to the PM2.5 exposure-induced increase in IL-6 in skeleton muscle than those of many other tissues.},

abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is believed to be one of the most hazardous air pollution with a ubiquitous presence. Animal studies have reported the association between prenatal exposure to traffic pollutant (not exclusively including PM2.5) and reproductive development in male offspring. However, the effects of prenatal exposure to PM2.5 on reproductive health in children are still unknown. The present study was based on the Shanghai-Minhang Birth Cohort Study (S-MBCS). A total of 876 pregnant women and their infants were included. Infants' anogenital distance (AGD, the distance from the anus to the genitals; AGDap [anus-penis] and AGDas [anus-scrotum] for boys, and AGDac [anus-clitoris] and AGDaf [anus-fourchette] for girls) were measured at birth. PM2.5 concentrations during pregnancy were estimated using satellite based modeling approach. Multiple linear regression analysis and multiple informant model were conducted to examine the associations between prenatal exposure to PM2.5 (pre $\mu$g/m3) and offspring's AGDs (mm). In order to minimize the misclassification of exposure, a sensitivity analysis restricted to mothers being off work during pregnancy was performed. In multiple linear regression models, we found that prenatal exposure to PM2.5 during the 1st and 3rd trimesters was associated with shorter AGDs. In multiple informant model, similar patterns were found, and statistically significant reductions were observed in AGDap ($\beta$=−0.278, 95%CI: -0.343∼-0.212), AGDac ($\beta$=−0.188, 95%CI: -0.247∼-0.130) and AGDaf ($\beta$= −0.163, 95%CI: -0.238∼-0.088) with PM2.5 exposure during the 1st trimester, and AGDap ($\beta$=−0.201, 95%CI: -0.247∼-0.155), AGDas ($\beta$=−0.158, 95%CI: -0.198∼-0.117), AGDac ($\beta$=−0.128, 95%CI: -0.167∼-0.089) and AGDaf ($\beta$ = −0.144, 95%CI: -0.194∼-0.094) with PM2.5 exposure during the 3rd trimester. The sensitivity analysis restricted to women being off work during pregnancy showed similar results. PM2.5 exposure during the 1st and 3rd trimesters was associated with shortened AGDs in offspring at birth. Our findings provide preliminary evidence that prenatal exposure to PM2.5 might be associated with the reproductive development of offspring.},

Therefore, a retrospective cohort was constructed using information from the health insurance database to evaluate whether exposure to PM2.5 is associated with increased mortality in aged stroke survivors residing in seven Korean metropolitan cities. A total of 45,513 older adults (≥65 years) who visited emergency rooms due to stroke and who were discharged alive between 2008 and 2016 were followed up. By using district-level modeled PM2.5 concentrations and a time-varying Cox proportional hazard model, associations between 1-month and 2-month moving average PM2.5 exposures and mortality in stroke survivors were evaluated. The annual average concentration of PM2.5 was 27.9 $\mu$g/m3 in the seven metropolitan cities, and 14,880 subjects died during the follow-up period. A 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in the 1-month and 2-month moving average PM2.5 exposures was associated with mortality hazard ratios of 1.07 (95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.09) and 1.06 (95% confidence interval: 1.03, 1.08), respectively. The effects of PM2.5 were similar across types of stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic), age groups (65–74, 75–84, and ≥85), and income groups (low and high) but were greater in women than in men. This study highlights the adverse health effects of ambient PM2.5 in post-stroke populations. Active avoidance behaviors against PM2.5 are recommended for aged stroke survivors.},

abstract = {Concentration-response function for exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) and mortality (i.e., relative risk, RR) may be inequal across communities by socioeconomic conditions. Investigation on specific mechanisms of this inequality regarding susceptibility to PM, beyond non-specific “socioeconomic conditions”, would provide policy-relevant implications for tackling this inequality. However, such investigation via epidemiological studies is challenged by residual confounding by correlated mechanisms and different loss of life expectancy by PM exposures between communities. Here, we aimed to assess community characteristics including different aspects of socioeconomic deprivation, medical resources, health behaviors, air quality, and greenness in their relation to inequal RR for PM10 and cause-specific mortality in 72 municipalities in South Korea, 2006–2013, considering these challenges. We found that a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10 on average across 46 days was associated with a 1.05% (95% CI: 0.24, 1.88) increase in all-cause mortality (ALL), 1.32% (95% CI: -0.29, 2.95) increase in cardiovascular mortality (CVD), and 6.47% (95% CI: 3.06, 10.00) increase in respiratory mortality (RES). The association between PM10 and mortality was higher in communities with higher ratio of SO2 to PM10 (ALL and RES), higher material deprivation (ALL, CVD, and RES), lower medical resources (CVD), higher prevalence of drinking (ALL and CVD), and lower prevalence of smoking (CVD and RES). Lag-structures showed smaller loss of life expectancy by PM exposures in communities with higher prevalence of smoking. Our findings suggest that PM-related health inequalities are shaped by a variety of mechanisms relating to susceptibility to PM exposures and different loss of life expectancy. Health policies controlling community characteristics may contribute to minimizing PM10-related health inequalities in those perspectives.},

We collected daily ambient air pollutants (O3, NO2 and PM2.5) concentrations from 24 Canadian urban centers from 2001 to 2012. We examined between-pollutant correlations and estimated their associations with respiratory hospitalization and mortality. We applied a generalized quasi-Poisson model to each city adjusting for one and/or two pollutants. Then we employed a Bayesian hierarchical model to pool the city-specific estimates for national estimates. We also examined 0- to 6-day air pollutant lagged effects by season. Overall, we found more frequently significant effects from single-pollutant models (vs. multi-pollutant models), for hospitalization (vs. mortality), for O3 (vs. NO2, PM2.5), for warm (vs. cold) season, and for lags ≤2 days (vs. 3–6 days). The most consistent effects appeared on respiratory hospitalization for 1-day lagged O3 and PM2.5, but not NO2. This study found little additive or antagonistic risk of respiratory health outcomes from multi-pollutant models due to low-to-medium correlations among the specified air pollutants.},

abstract = {Background
Urban environmental air pollution has become a serious public issue in China. However, the potential adverse effects of different air pollutants on liver function are still unclear. We aimed to explore the associations of air pollutants exposure with liver function, and analyzed short-term impact in two cities with different levels of air pollution.
Methods
We included 3892 residents from the Wuhan (high-pollution area)-Zhuhai (low-pollution area) cohort. Liver enzymes including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in fasting peripheral blood were determined by a fully automatic biochemical analyzer. Individual air pollutants inhalation exposure was estimated by combining his/her daily breathing volume and the concentrations of six air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particulate matter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and ozone (O3), from local ambient air monitoring stations. The associations of air pollutants with ALT and AST were evaluated using linear mixed models.
Results
We found positive associations of PM2.5 (lag01-lag07), PM10 (lag01-lag07), NO2 (lag01-lag07), SO2 (lag01-lag07), CO (lag01-lag06) and O3 (lag01-lag02) with ALT and PM10 (lag04-lag07) with AST. In Wuhan, exposure to PM2.5 (lag01-lag07), PM10 (lag01-lag07), NO2 (lag01-lag07) and SO2 (lag01-lag07) was associated with increased ALT, and PM10 (lag04-lag07) and NO2 (lag01-lag03) exposure was significantly associated with increased AST. While in Zhuhai, although all six air pollutants (PM2.5 [lag01-lag07], PM10 [lag01-lag02], NO2 [lag01-lag04], SO2 [lag01-lag03], CO [lag01-lag07] and O3 [lag01-lag03]) were significantly associated with increased ALT, no pollutant was significantly associated with increased AST.
Conclusions
Our results suggest that short-term exposure to air pollutants has adverse effects on liver function among urban adults. Such adverse effects last longer in high-pollution area than that in low-pollution area.},

This study sought to assess the association of five major air pollutants concentration levels and number of Emergency Department (ED) visits for ear and mastoid pathology in the large Canadian urban city, Toronto. A time-stratified case-crossover study design was used for the period between April 1, 2004 and December 31, 2015. Daily air pollution data were collected from the National Air Pollution Surveillance Database for carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ground-level ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Data were also collected for weather variables. ED visit data were extracted from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System database. Conditional Poisson models were applied using daily counts of the ED visits. Temperature and relative humidity in the models were represented by natural splines. Independent variables (air pollutants and weather conditions) were lagged by the same number of exposure days, from 0 to 14. The analyses were grouped by strata according to patients' sex and age, also by seasons. For each studied pollutant, 270 models were derived (15 lags × 18 strata). There were 188,997 ED visits during the 140-month study period. Children under 10 years represented 31.7% of all visits, compared to 53.8% for patients aged 11–60 years, and 14.5% for those above 60 years. Short-term (time lags 4 and 5 days) NO2 exposure was positively associated with number of ED visits for ear and mastoid pathology for children independent of sex. Boys had relative risks (RR) of 1.030 (95% confidence intervals: 1.009–1.053) and 1.033 (1.011–1.055) for ED visits on days 4 and 5 after exposure to NO2 by one interquartile range (IQR = 8.8 ppb), respectively. Girls had RR of 1.046 (1.021–1.071) and 1.039 (1.014–1.064) on days 4 and 5 after exposure to NO2 by the same IQR, respectively. For lag 4, a one unit increase in the calculated air quality health index results in a 1.038 (1.020–1.057), 1.042 (1.017–1.067), and 1.036 (1.014–1.058), for all children, girls, and boys, respectively.

abstract = {Introduction
Ambient air pollution might increase the risk of obesity; however, the evidence regarding the relationship between air pollution and obesity in comparable urban and rural areas is limited. Therefore, our aim was to contrast the effect estimates of varying air pollution particulate matter on obesity between urban and rural areas.
Methods
Four obesity indicators were evaluated in this study, namely, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). Exposure to ambient air pollution (e.g., particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters 1.0 $\mu$m [PM1], PM2.5, and PM10) was estimated using satellite-based random forest models. Linear regression and logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between air pollution particulate matter and obesity. Furthermore, the effect estimates of different air pollution particulates were contrasted between urban and rural areas.
Results
A total of 36,998 participants in urban areas and 31, 256 in rural areas were included. We found positive associations between long-term exposure to PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 and obesity. Of these air pollutants, PM2.5 had the strongest association. The results showed that the odds ratios (ORs) for general obesity were 1.8 (95% CI, 1.64 to 1.98) per interquartile range (IQR) $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM1, 1.89 (95% CI, 1.71 to 2.1) per IQR $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5, and 1.74 (95% CI, 1.58 to 1.9) per IQR $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10. The concentrations of air pollutants were lower in rural areas, but the effects of air pollution on obesity of rural residents were higher than those of urban residents.
Conclusion
Long-term (3 years average) exposure to ambient air pollution was associated with an increased risk of obesity. We observed regional disparities in the effects of particulate matter exposure from air pollution on the risk of obesity, with higher effect estimates found in rural areas. Air quality interventions should be prioritized not only in urban areas but also in rural areas to reduce the risk of obesity.},

Here we assessed the intraday effect of air pollution on AMI risk and potential effect modification by pre-existing cardiac risk factors. Hourly data on emergency department visits (EDVs) for AMI and air pollutants in Brisbane, Australia during 2013–2015 were acquired from pertinent government departments. A time-stratified case-crossover analysis was adopted to examine relationships of AMI risk with hourly changes in particulate matters (aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) and ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10)) and gaseous pollutants (ozone and nitrogen dioxide) after adjusting for potential confounders. We also conducted stratified analyses according to age, gender, disease history, season, and day/night time exposure. Excess risk of AMI per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in air pollutant concentration was reported at four time windows: within 1, 2–6, 7–12, and 13–24 h. Both single- and multi-pollutant models found an elevated risk of AMI within 2–6 h after exposure to PM2.5 (excessive risk: 12.34%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.44%–24.42% in single-pollutant model) and PM10 within 1 h (excessive risk: 5.21%, 95% CI: 0.26%–10.40% in single-pollutant model). We did not find modification effect by age, gender, season or day/night time, except that PM2.5 had a greater effect on EDVs for AMI during night-time than daytime. Our findings suggest that AMI risk could increase within hours after exposure to particulate matters.},

There is a lack of studies directly comparing the effect of air pollution on acute coronary syndrome (ACS) occurrence in industrial and non-industrial areas.
Objectives
A comparison of association of air pollution exposure with ACS in two cohorts of industrially different areas.
Materials and methods
The study covered 6,000,000 person-years of follow-up and five pollutants between 2008 and 2017. A time series regression analysis with 7-lag was used to assess the effects air pollution on ACS.
Results
A total of 9046 patients with ACS were included in the analysis, of whom 3895 (43.06%) had ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) - 45.39% from non-industrial area, and 42.37% from industrial area; and 5151 (56.94%) had non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) - 54.61% from non-industrial area and 57.63% from industrial area. The daily concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO were higher in industrial than in non-industrial area (P < 0.001). In non-industrial area, an increase of 10 $\mu$g/m3 of NO2 concentration (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.126, 95%CI = 1.009–1.257; P = 0.034, lag-0) and an increase of 1 mg/m3 in CO concentration (RR = 1.055, 95%CI = 1.010–1.103; P = 0.017, lag-0) were associated with an increase in the number of hospitalization due to NSTEMI (for industrial area increase of 10 $\mu$g/m3 in NO2 (OR = 1.062, 95%CI = 1.020–1.094; P = 0.005, lag-0), SO2 (OR = 1.061, 95%CI = 1.010–1.116; P = 0.018, lag-4), PM10 (OR = 1.010, 95%CI = 1.001–1.030; P = 0.047, lag-6). In STEMI patients in industrial area, an increased hospitalization was found to be associated with an increase of 10 $\mu$g/m3 in SO2 (OR = 1.094, 95%CI = 1.030–1.162; P = 0.002, lag-1), PM2.5 (OR = 1.041, 95%CI = 1.020–1.073; P < 0.001, lag-1), PM10 (OR = 1.030, 95%CI = 1.010–1.051; P < 0.001, lag-1). No effects of air pollution on the number of hospitalization due to STEMI were noted from non-industrial area.
Conclusion
The risk of air pollution-related ACS was higher in industrial over non-industrial area. The effect of NO2 on the incidence of NSTEMI was observed in both areas. In industrial area, the effect of PMs and SO2 on NSTEMI and STEMI were also observed. A clinical effect was more delayed in time in patients with NSTEMI, especially after exposure to PM10. Chronic exposure to air pollution may underlie the differences in the short-term effect between particulate air pollution impact on the incidence of STEMI.},

But longitudinal cohort studies focused on health effects of long-term air pollution exposure are still limited in Southeast Asian countries where sources of air pollution, weather conditions, and demographic characteristics are different. The present study examined the association between long-term exposure to air pollution and self-reported morbidities in participants of the Thai cohort study (TCS) in Bangkok metropolitan region (BMR), Thailand.
Methods
This longitudinal cohort study was conducted for 9 years from 2005 to 2013. Self-reported morbidities in this study included high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and diabetes. Air pollution data were obtained from the Thai government Pollution Control Department (PCD). Particles with diameters ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO) exposures were estimated with ordinary kriging method using 22 background and 7 traffic monitoring stations in BMR during 2005–2013. Long-term exposure periods to air pollution for each subject was averaged as the same period of person-time. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between long-term air pollution exposure with self-reported high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes. Results of self-reported morbidity were presented as hazard ratios (HRs) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, and CO.
Results
After controlling for potential confounders, we found that an IQR increase in PM10 was significantly associated with self-reported high blood pressure (HR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.23) and high blood cholesterol (HR = 1.07, 95%CI: 1.02, 1.12), but not with diabetes (HR = 1.05, 95%CI: 0.91, 1.21). SO2 was also positively associated with self-reported high blood pressure (HR = 1.22, 95%CI: 1.08, 1.38), high blood cholesterol (HR = 1.20, 95%CI: 1.11, 1.30), and diabetes (HR = 1.21, 95%CI: 0.92, 1.60). Moreover, we observed a positive association between CO and self-reported high blood pressure (HR = 1.07, 95%CI: 1.00, 1.15), but not for other diseases. However, self-reported morbidities were not associated with O3 and NO2.
Conclusions
Long-term exposure to air pollution, especially for PM10 and SO2 was associated with self-reported high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and diabetes in subjects of TCS. Our study supports that exposure to air pollution increases cardiovascular disease risk factors for younger population.},

abstract = {Background
Air pollution and greenness are associated with short- and long-term respiratory health in children but the underlying mechanisms are only scarcely investigated. The nasal microbiota during the first year of life has been shown to be associated with respiratory tract infections and asthma development. Thus, an interplay between greenness, air pollution and the early nasal microbiota may contribute to short- and long-term respiratory health. We aimed to examine associations between fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and greenness with the nasal microbiota of healthy infants during the first year of life in a European context with low-to-moderate air pollution levels.
Methods
Microbiota characterization was performed using 16 S rRNA pyrosequencing of 846 nasal swabs collected fortnightly from 47 healthy infants of the prospective Basel-Bern Infant Lung Development (BILD) cohort. We investigated the association of satellite-based greenness and an 8-day-average exposure to air pollution (PM2.5, NO2) with the nasal microbiota during the first year of life. Exposures were individually estimated with novel spatial-temporal models incorporating satellite data. Generalized additive mixed models adjusted for known confounders and considering the autoregressive correlation structure of the data were used for analysis.
Results
Mean (SD) PM2.5 level was 17.1 (3.8 $\mu$g/m3) and mean (SD) NO2 level was 19.7 (7.9 $\mu$g/m3). Increased PM2.5 and increased NO2 were associated with reduced within-subject Ru{\v{z}}i{\v{c}}ka dissimilarity (PM2.5: per 1 $\mu$g/m3 -0.004, 95% CI -0.008, −0.001; NO2: per 1 $\mu$g/m3 -0.004, 95% CI -0.007, −0.001). Whole microbial community comparison with nonmetric multidimensional scaling revealed distinct microbiota profiles for different PM2.5 exposure levels. Increased NO2 was additionally associated with reduced abundance of Corynebacteriaceae (per 1 $\mu$g/m3: −0.027, 95% CI -0.053, −0.001). No associations were found between greenness and the nasal microbiota.
Conclusion
Air pollution was associated with Ru{\v{z}}i{\v{c}}ka dissimilarity and relative abundance of Corynebacteriaceae. This suggests that even low-to-moderate exposure to air pollution may impact the nasal microbiota during the first year of life. Our results will be useful for future studies assessing the clinical relevance of air-pollution-induced alterations of the nasal microbiota with subsequent respiratory disease development.},

We conducted a retrospective cohort study in four northern Chinese cities (Tianjin, Taiyuan, Shenyang and Rizhao). This retrospective cohort study was based on the household registration information of each community in 1998 as the baseline to establish a cohort, and the follow-up of four cities was completed from September to December 2009. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic and sociological information, lifestyle, eating habits and disease history. Air pollutant data in four cities were obtained through the China National Environmental Monitoring Center. The 24-h daily average concentration was used to calculate the annual average concentration, we used annual average concentration as time-varying exposures. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to analyze the association between SO2 and the risk of coronary heart disease; the potential effect modifiers were analyzed by stratification. Sensitivity analysis was used to verify the results at the same time. A total of 36,379 participants were analyzed for coronary heart disease in this study, and 1012 developed coronary heart disease; the cumulative incidence rate was 2.78%. After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, lifestyle and other related confounding factors, the risk of coronary heart disease increased by 2.5% for every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in SO2 concentration. Tea drinkers and people who eat fewer vegetables and people with lower level of education were more sensitive to SO2 exposure.},

abstract = {Air pollution may trigger systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, few studies have investigated the associations between air pollution and complications of SLE, such as lupus nephritis (LN). In this study, multicenter longitudinal data from 13 hospitals in China, including 8552 SLE patients with 24,762 visits, were used. Based on the generalized estimating equation (GEE) model, we assessed the associations of LN occurrence with short-term exposures to different air pollutants including particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3). We identified 2672 LN patients, and about half of them were from east China. Our results based on the entire data set showed that PM2.5 and NO2 were risk factors for LN within one month after exposure, with odds ratio of 1.16 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08–1.19) at lag 18 day and 1.19 (95% CI, 1.12–1.26) at lag 16 day relative to an interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5 and NO2, respectively. This positive association between LN and NO2 was also observed for south, west, and east China. In addition, we found that the short term exposure to CO and O3 was not generally associated with LN. Finally, the negative associations of LN with SO2 were found for the entire region and east China. Our results implied that SLE patients may gain the health benefits of air quality improvement in China. Our work also provided evidence that short-term variations in air pollution may trigger LN, and further studies are needed to confirm these findings and the potential pathogenic mechanisms should be explored.},

abstract = {Children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of air pollution. To tackle this issue and implement effective strategies to reduce child exposure, it is important to understand how children are exposed to this risk. This study followed a citizen science approach to air pollution monitoring, aiming to characterise school children's exposure to air pollution and to analyse how a citizen science approach to data collection could contribute to and enhance the research process. 258 children across five London primary schools attended air pollution education sessions and measured air pollution for a week using backpacks with built-in air quality sensors. Children received a summary of the results, advice and information on how to reduce exposure to air pollution. Data on the impact of the approach on the school community were collected using surveys and focus groups with children and their parents and interviews with the teachers involved. The unique data set obtained permitted us to map different routes and modes of transport used by the children and quantify different exposure levels. We identified that, on average, children were exposed to higher levels of air pollution when travelling to and from school, particularly during the morning journey where air pollution levels were on average 52% higher than exposures at school. Children who walked to and from school through busy main roads were exposed to 33% higher levels of air pollution than those who travelled through back streets. The findings from this study showed that using a citizen science approach to data collection, where children are actively involved in the research process, not only facilitated the gathering of a large data set by encouraging participation and stimulating adherence with the study protocol, but also increased children's awareness of air pollution, encouraging them to adopt positive behaviour changes to reduce their exposure.},

The coordinated control of PM2.5 and ozone is becoming a new issue for China's air pollution control. This study quantitatively assessed the health impacts attributed to PM2.5 and ozone pollution in 338 Chinese cities from 2015 to 2020 and estimated the possible health benefits from achieving dual concentration targets during 2021–2025. Results show PM2.5 caused a total health impact of 2.45 × 107 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2020. All-cause and respiratory ozone-related health impact in 2020 was 1.04 × 107 DALYs and 1.56 × 106 DALYs. Between 2015 and 2020, the PM2.5-related health impacts decreased by 14.97%, while those ozone-related increased by 94.61% and 96.54% for all-cause and respiratory. Cities in the North China Plain have suffered higher health impacts attributable to PM2.5 and ozone pollution, indicating that the two-pollutant coordinated control is primarily needed. By achieving aggressive concentration target (decreasing 10%) between 2020 and 2025, China will reduce the PM2.5-related health impacts in 338 cities by 1.56 × 106 DALYs (improving 6.37%). By achieving general target (decreasing 10% or within the Interim target-1 of World Health Organization), the PM2.5-related health benefit will be 7.98 × 105 DALYs (improving 3.25%). The deteriorating ozone health risks will also be improved. Controlling air pollution in large cities and regional center cities can achieve remarkable health benefits. Due to the inter-region, inter-province, and inter-city difference of health impacts, targeted and differentiated pollution prevention and control need to be implemented.},

abstract = {The burning of fossil fuels – especially coal, petrol, and diesel – is a major source of airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and a key contributor to the global burden of mortality and disease. Previous risk assessments have examined the health response to total PM2.5, not just PM2.5 from fossil fuel combustion, and have used a concentration-response function with limited support from the literature and data at both high and low concentrations. This assessment examines mortality associated with PM2.5 from only fossil fuel combustion, making use of a recent meta-analysis of newer studies with a wider range of exposure. We also estimated mortality due to lower respiratory infections (LRI) among children under the age of five in the Americas and Europe, regions for which we have reliable data on the relative risk of this health outcome from PM2.5 exposure. We used the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem to estimate global exposure levels to fossil-fuel related PM2.5 in 2012. Relative risks of mortality were modeled using functions that link long-term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality, incorporating nonlinearity in the concentration response. We estimate a global total of 10.2 (95% CI: −47.1 to 17.0) million premature deaths annually attributable to the fossil-fuel component of PM2.5. The greatest mortality impact is estimated over regions with substantial fossil fuel related PM2.5, notably China (3.9 million), India (2.5 million) and parts of eastern US, Europe and Southeast Asia. The estimate for China predates substantial decline in fossil fuel emissions and decreases to 2.4 million premature deaths due to 43.7% reduction in fossil fuel PM2.5 from 2012 to 2018 bringing the global total to 8.7 (95% CI: −1.8 to 14.0) million premature deaths. We also estimated excess annual deaths due to LRI in children (0–4 years old) of 876 in North America, 747 in South America, and 605 in Europe. This study demonstrates that the fossil fuel component of PM2.5 contributes a large mortality burden. The steeper concentration-response function slope at lower concentrations leads to larger estimates than previously found in Europe and North America, and the slower drop-off in slope at higher concentrations results in larger estimates in Asia. Fossil fuel combustion can be more readily controlled than other sources and precursors of PM2.5 such as dust or wildfire smoke, so this is a clear message to policymakers and stakeholders to further incentivize a shift to clean sources of energy.},

We found that long-term air pollutant exposure (measured in 10-$\mu$g/m3 increments) to PM2.5 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.16, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.53–3.04), PM10 (OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.12–1.72), SO2 (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.28–1.86), NO2 (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.23–1.67), and CO (OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 101–1.03) were positively associated with elevated LDL-C level. Of all pollutants, PM2.5 had the largest effect on LDL-C level. Increased O3 exposure (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57–0.76) had a beneficial effect on LDL-C level. Interaction effects of air pollution and physical activity, as well as white blood cell counts, on LDL-C level were found. Effects of air pollution on triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not significant, and effects of air pollution on total cholesterol were weaker than those on LDL-C.

abstract = {Background
Epidemiological studies have documented the adverse effects of long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on health, while there has been less research on the effects of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), black carbon (BC) and especially ozone (O3). Furthermore, there is limited evidence for the synergistic effects of exposure to pollutants and greenness. We investigated the association of long-term exposure to air pollution and greenness with natural-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in Greece using an ecological study design.
Methods
Mortality and socioeconomic data were obtained from 1035 municipal units from the 2011 census data. Annual average PM2.5, NO2, BC and O3 concentrations for 2010 were derived from 100 × 100 m surfaces predicted by hybrid LUR models. The normalized difference vegetation index was used to assess greenness. We applied Poisson regression models on standardized mortality rates adjusted for socioeconomic indicators and lung cancer rates, accounting for spatial autocorrelation. The analysis was conducted initially for the whole country and then separately for urban and rural areas. We assessed interactions between pollutants and greenness and applied two-exposure models.
Results
An interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5, NO2 and BC was associated with increases in natural-cause mortality (Relative Risk (RR) 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 1.11; RR 1.03 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.04) and RR 1.02 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.03), respectively), while PM2.5 and NO2 were also associated with cause-specific mortality. Greenness was associated with lower natural-cause (RR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.94, 0.96 per IQR) and cause-specific mortality. For all outcomes we estimated a protective association with O3 (natural-cause mortality RR 0.79, 95% CI: 0.76, 0.82 per IQR). All associations were stronger in urban areas. We estimated negative statistically significant interactions between air pollution and greenness for respiratory morality and positive ones for cardiovascular mortality. Estimates were mostly robust to co-exposure adjustment.
Conclusions
Our findings support associations of air pollution and greenness with mortality, both in urban and rural areas of Greece. Further research is needed to elaborate on the synergies in cause-specific mortality. Our results on the interactions between pollutants and greenness may imply differential biological mechanisms for cause-specific mortality and warrant further investigation.},

We obtained 41,203 weekday UD ER-admissions for secondary and tertiary hospitals in all 16 districts in Beijing during 2013–2018 from the Beijing Municipal Health Commission Information Center and obtained district-level air pollution concentrations based on 35 fixed monitoring stations in Beijing. We conducted a two-stage time-series analysis, with district-specific generalized linear models for each of Beijing's 16 districts, followed by random effects meta-analysis to obtain pooled risk estimates. We evaluated lagged and cumulative associations up to 30 days. In single-pollutant models, for both PM2.5 and PM10, cumulative exposure averaged over the day of admission and the previous 10 days (lag 0–10 days) showed the strongest association, with per interquartile range increases of PM2.5 or PM10 concentrations associated with a 7.5 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3.0 %–12.2 %) or 6.0 % (95 % CI: 1.1 %–11.2 %) increased risk of daily UD hospital admissions, respectively. The risk estimates were robust to adjustment for co-pollutants and to a variety of sensitivity analyses. However, due to the strong correlation between PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, we were unable to disentangle the respective relationships between these two exposures and UD risk. In this study, we found that short-term exposures to PM2.5 and PM10 are risk factors for UD morbidity and that cumulative exposure to PM pollution over a period of one to two weeks (i.e., 11 days) could be more important for UD risk than transient exposure during each of the respective single days.},

Accurate predictions of these health effects of air pollution are essential for efficient planning of various sectors related to economic performances as well as strategic management to improve human health and air quality. The main objectives of this research were to determine the long-term effects of air pollution on respiratory morbidity and mortality with the Dickey-Fuller test as well as develop accurate prediction of respiratory morbidity and mortality with nonlinear autoregressive and artificial neural network models. This study examined daily variations in respiratory mortality and morbidity attributed to air pollutants in Ahvaz for 9-yrs period. The results showed that nitrogen monoxide and carbon monoxide have significant effect on total respiratory mortality. The sensitivity analysis and ADF test showed that the other pollutants (NO2, SO2, O3, PM10) had no significant effect on the total respiratory morbidity and mortality rate. For the nonlinear autoregressive model, topology 2-10-1 with two input, including nitrogen oxide and carbon oxide, ten hidden layers were the best (MSE = 0.1 and R = 0.82) for predicting the total mortality rate. Artificial neural network and nonlinear autoregressive models are very powerful methods for accurate prediction of respiratory mortality and mobility with at least three inputs. These ﬁndings strongly support the need for policymakers to set targets to reduce carbon monoxide and nitrogen monoxide concentrations in the environment.},

abstract = {In the United States (US), immigrants constitute a considerable and growing proportion of the general population. Compared to the US-born, immigrants have differential health risks, and it is unclear if environmental exposures contribute. In this work, we estimated disparities between immigrants and the US-born in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure and attributable premature mortality, including by region of origin and time since immigration. With PM2.5 estimates from a validated model at $\sim$1 km2 spatial resolution and residential Census tract population data, we calculated the annual area-weighted average PM2.5 exposure for immigrants overall, the US-born, and immigrants separately by geographic region of origin and time since immigration. We then calculated the premature mortality attributed to PM2.5 for each population group, assessing disparities by immigrant status in PM2.5 exposure and attributable premature mortality in the US as a whole and in each US county to evevaluate spatial heterogeneity. Overall, immigrants were exposed to slightly higher PM2.5 (0.36 $\mu$g/m3, 3.8%) than the US-born. This exposure difference translates to 2.11 more premature deaths attributable to PM2.5 per 100,000 in population for immigrants compared to the US-born in 2010. Immigrant – US-born disparities in PM2.5 and attributable premature mortality were more severe among immigrants originating from Asia, Africa, and Latin America than those from Europe, Oceania, and North America. Disparities between immigrant groups by time since immigration were comparatively small. Sensitivity analyses using 2000 data and a non-linear set of PM2.5 attributable mortality coefficients identified similar patterns. Our findings suggest that environmental exposure disparities, such as in PM2.5, may contribute to immigrant health disparities in the US.},

abstract = {Background
Substantial research has investigated the adverse effects of traffic-related air pollutants (TRAP) on human health. Convincing associations between TRAP and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are known, but the underlying biological mechanisms are not well established. High-resolution metabolomics (HRM) is a promising platform for untargeted characterization of molecular mechanisms between TRAP and health indexes.
Objectives
We examined metabolic perturbations associated with short-term exposures to TRAP, including carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC) among 180 participants of the Center for Health Discovery and Well-Being (CHDWB), a cohort of Emory University-affiliated employees.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted on baseline visits of 180 CHDWB participants enrolled during 2008–2012, in whom HRM profiling was determined in plasma samples using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry with positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) modes. Ambient pollution concentrations were measured at an ambient monitor near downtown Atlanta. Metabolic perturbations associated with TRAP exposures were assessed following an untargeted metabolome-wide association study (MWAS) framework using feature-specific Tobit regression models, followed by enriched pathway analysis and chemical annotation.
Results
Subjects were predominantly white (76.1%) and non-smokers (95.6%), and all had at least a high school education. In total, 7821 and 4123 metabolic features were extracted from the plasma samples by the negative and positive ESI runs, respectively. There are 3421 features significantly associated with at least one air pollutant by negative ion mode, and 1691 features by positive ion mode. Biological pathways enriched by features associated with the pollutants are primarily involved in nucleic acids damage/repair (e.g., pyrimidine metabolism), nutrient metabolism (e.g., fatty acid metabolism), and acute inflammation (e.g., histidine metabolism and tyrosine metabolism). NO2 and EC were associated most consistently with these pathways. We confirmed the chemical identity of 8 metabolic features in negative ESI and 2 features in positive ESI, including metabolites closely linked to oxidative stress and inflammation, such as histamine, tyrosine, tryptophan, and proline.
Conclusions
We identified a range of ambient pollutants, including components of TRAP, associated with differences in the metabolic phenotype among the cohort of 180 subjects. We found Tobit models to be a robust approach to handle missing data among the metabolic features. The results were encouraging of further use of HRM and MWAS approaches for characterizing molecular mechanisms underlying exposure to TRAP.},

abstract = {Background
Previously, numerous epidemiologic studies reported an association between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and exposure to air pollution during pregnancy. However, there have been no metabolomics studies investigating the impact of pregnancy pollution exposure to ASD risk in offspring.
Objectives
To identify differences in maternal metabolism that may reflect a biological response to exposure to high air pollution in pregnancies of offspring who later did or did not develop ASD.
Methods
We obtained stored mid-pregnancy serum from 214 mothers who lived in California's Central Valley and experienced the highest levels of air pollution during early pregnancy. We estimated each woman's average traffic-related air pollution exposure (carbon monoxide, nitric oxides, and particulate matter <2.5 $\mu$m) during the first trimester using the California Line Source Dispersion Model, version 4 (CALINE4). By utilizing liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry, we identified the metabolic profiles of maternal serum for 116 mothers with offspring who later developed ASD and 98 control mothers. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was employed to select metabolic features associated with air pollution exposure or autism risk in offspring. We also conducted extensive pathway enrichment analysis to elucidate potential ASD-related changes in the metabolome of pregnant women.
Results
We extracted 4022 and 4945 metabolic features from maternal serum samples in hydrophilic interaction (HILIC) chromatography (positive ion mode) and C18 (negative ion mode) columns, respectively. After controlling for potential confounders, we identified 167 and 222 discriminative features (HILIC and C18, respectively). Pathway enrichment analysis to discriminate metabolic features associated with ASD risk indicated various metabolic pathway perturbations linked to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and mitochondrial function, including carnitine shuttle, amino acid metabolism, bile acid metabolism, and vitamin A metabolism.
Conclusion
Using high resolution metabolomics, we identified several metabolic pathways disturbed in mothers with ASD offspring among women experiencing high exposure to traffic-related air pollution during pregnancy that were associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings provide us with a better understanding of metabolic disturbances involved in the development of ASD under adverse environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Land-use regression models and remote sensing data have been widely employed to forecast atmospheric aerosol levels. Recently, these methodologies have been combined to predict the influence of this pollutant on human health. However, traditional land-use regression models do not often consider the complex interactions between predictors, and most of these do not include socioeconomic variables. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to estimate suspended particle-related hospital admissions by employing remote sensing, meteorological, environmental, and demographic parameters. In this cohort study, we analyzed 1,612,049 hospital admissions from C{\'{o}}rdoba city, Argentina, from 2005 to 2011, and developed several regression and machine learning land-use models to compare their predictive powers. We found that childhood was the age group with the highest number of hospital admissions related with upper respiratory tract diseases. When predicting population-normalized hospital admissions, the machine learning models, in particular the generalized boosted machine, revealed a better performance than regression models, exhibiting the lowest root mean square error (0.4264) in the test data set. This model also achieved the best R2adj (0.6088) when plotting predicted vs. reported normalized cases. The most important predictors were the meteorological variables, followed by the aerosol optical depth and the planet boundary layer height. Some other predictors, such as educational level, land value, and unsatisfied basic needs, showed less relevance but enhanced the model's prediction power. Furthermore, the predictive power increased after a 1-day lag in hospital admissions (RMSE = 0.4121), highlighting the importance of meteorological and environmental variables in the onset of respiratory diseases.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to air pollutants is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. But evidence on the effects of preconceptional air pollution exposure on the risk of termination of pregnancy (TOP) caused by pregnancy losses and congenital malformations is lacking.
Methods
The distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) was used to evaluate the impact of short-term air pollutants exposure on the risk of TOP. Stratified analyses by age (<35 years old, ≥ 35 years old) and season (warm season, cold season) were further conducted. Relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidential interval (95 % CI) were calculated for per interquartile range (IQR) increment in air pollutants during the study period.
Results
PM2.5, PM10, and O3 exposure were significantly associated with elevated risk of TOP. The risk of TOP was associated with PM2.5 exposure from lag11 to lag15 in the single-pollutant model, and the strongest association was observed at lag13 (RR = 1.021, 95%CI:1.002–1.040). PM10 exposure from lag10 to lag15 was associated with increased TOP risk, with the corresponding peak association being at lag13 (RR = 1.020, 95%CI: 1.004–1.037). For O3, the single-day lag association appeared to be statistically significant from lag26 to lag27, with the highest RR of TOP cases being at lag27 (RR = 1.044, 95%CI: 1.005–1.084). Similar results were observed for pregnancy losses (PL). However, no significantly association between air pollution exposure and the risk of congenital malformations (CM) was found in this study. Stratified analyses showed that pregnant women with more advanced ages were more susceptible to PM2.5, PM10, and O3 exposure. The effect of PM2.5 exposure was statistically significant in cold season subgroups.
Conclusion
The findings suggest that exposure to PM2.5, PM10, and O3 before pregnancy are associated with the risk of TOP in Lu'an, China, reflecting the significance of preconceptional environmental exposure in the development of adverse pregnancy outcomes.},

Prenatal air pollution exposure is also associated with adverse outcomes for women and infants. We examined whether women with type 1 diabetes are more vulnerable than other women to pollution-associated risks during pregnancy.
Methods
In singleton deliveries from the Consortium on Safe Labor (2002–2008), obstetric and neonatal outcomes were compared for women with type 1 diabetes (n = 507) and women without autoimmune disease (n = 204,384). Preconception, trimester, and whole pregnancy average air pollutant exposure (ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter >10 $\mu$m (PM10), PM > 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx)) were estimated using modified Community Multiscale Air Quality models. Poisson regression models with diabetes*pollutant interaction terms estimated relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for adverse outcomes, adjusted for maternal characteristics and geographic region.
Results
For whole pregnancy exposure to SO2, women with type 1 diabetes had 15% increased risk (RR:1.15 95%CI:1.01,1.31) and women without autoimmune disease had 5% increased risk (RR:1.05 95%CI:1.05,1.06) for small for gestational age birth (pinteraction = 0.09). Additionally, whole pregnancy O3 exposure was associated with 10% increased risk (RR:1.10 95%CI:1.02,1.17) among women with type 1 diabetes and 2% increased risk (RR:1.02 95%CI:1.00,1.04) among women without autoimmune disease for perinatal mortality (pinteraction = 0.08). Similar patterns were observed between PM2.5 exposure and spontaneous preterm birth.
Conclusions
Pregnant women with type 1 diabetes may be at greater risk for adverse outcomes when exposed to air pollution than women without autoimmune disease.},

The impacts of air pollution on physical health are well known, whereas few studies have explored the association of atmospheric pollution, especially short-term air pollution exposure, with the risk of anxiety disorders. In addition, there are increasing concerns in emerging evidence supporting a possible etiological link. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the relationship between short-term exposure to atmospheric pollutants and anxiety outpatient visits in Xi'an, a city of northwestern China and a metropolis with relatively heavy air pollution. We collected the data of both daily outpatient visits and daily air pollution (SO2, NO2, and PM10) between January 1, 2010 and January 31, 2016 (2222 days). To clarify the association between short-term ambient atmospheric pollution exposure and anxiety outpatient visits, an over-dispersed Poisson generalized additive model was applied by adjusting the day of the week and weather conditions (including temperature, humidity, sunlight hours, and rainfalls). Positive association between gaseous air pollutants (SO2 and NO2) and anxiety daily outpatient visits was observed. Moreover, the largest estimated values of both SO2 and NO2 were evidence at lag 03 (4-day moving average lag), with 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase corresponded to the increase of outpatient anxiety visits at 4.11% (95% CI: 2.15%, 6.06%) for SO2 and 3.97% (95% CI: 1.90%, 6.06%) for NO2. However, there was no differences in susceptibility to air pollutants between different genders as well as different ages. Taken together, short-term exposure to ambient air pollutants, especially gaseous air pollutants (NO2 and SO2), can be related to higher risk of anxiety outpatient visits.},

Though growing evidence has linked air pollution to Parkinson's disease (PD), the results remain inconsistent. Less is known about the relevance of road proximity and surrounding green. We aimed to investigate the individual and joint associations of air pollution, road proximity and surrounding green with the incidence of PD in a prospective cohort study.
Methods
We used data from a prospective cohort of 47,516 participants recruited from July 2015 to January 2018 in Ningbo, China. Long-term exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) and ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) estimated by land-use regression models, road proximity and surrounding green assessed by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were calculated based on the residential address for each participant. Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze the individual and joint effects of air pollution, road proximity, and surrounding green on PD.
Results
In single-exposure models, PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and road proximity was associated with increased risk of PD (e.g. Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.51, 95%CI:1.02, 2.24 per interquartile range (IQR) increase for PM2.5) while surrounding green was associated with decreased risk of PD (e.g. HR = 0.80, 95%CI:0.65, 0.98 per IQR increase for NDVI in 300 m buffer). In two-exposure models, the associations of PM2.5 and surrounding green persisted while the associations of NO2 and road proximity attenuated towards unity.
Conclusions
We found that PM2.5 were associated with increased risk of incident PD while surrounding green was associated with decreased risk of PD. Future studies about PD etiology may benefit from including multiple environmental exposures to address potential joint associations.},

However, very few studies focused on the effects of ultrafine particles (UFPs, particles< 0.1 $\mu$m) on children respiratory health. We performed a panel study with 3 rounds of follow-up among 65 pupils at the Elementary School Affiliated to Shanghai Normal University in China from November 2018 to June 2019. Real-time concentrations of UFPs were measured in the campus. In each visit, we detected biomarkers in saliva and microflora in buccal mucosa, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and lung function. We applied a linear mixed-effect (LME) model to examine the associations of UFPs and each health outcome. We found increased levels of FeNO and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) and reduced lung function in association with higher UFP exposure. For each interquartile range increase of UFPs, the largest changes were found in lag 0–72 h for forced vital capacity [-69.02 ml (95% CI: −114.20, −23.84)], TNF-$\alpha$ [13.41 pg/ml (95% CI: 7.08, 19.73)], and FeNO [26.85% (95% CI: 11.84%, 43.88%)].

UFP exposure was also associated with increased Streptococcus, Gemella, and decreased Actinomyces. Short-term UFP exposures may impair the respiratory system by inducing inflammation, decreasing lung function and attenuating buccal microbe diversity in children.},

The modelling of air quality, assessment of human health impact, and estimation of health impact models are useful tools for assessing the impact of air pollution on health. This study proposes a model framework for assessing air pollution damage, including air quality simulation for PM10, assessment of human health impacts, and estimation of health impact models that meet the requirements of actual monitoring data. The novel contribution of this study is a proposal for the application of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)/Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System (CMAQ) model and the epidemiological coefficient $\beta$ of concentration–response functions (CRFs), which were determined from epidemiological studies and selected in accordance with the study area conditions under limited conditions related to the field measurement data, to calculate the health impacts and economic losses caused by PM10. Calculation results for a typical month in 2017 showed that economic losses were approximately 125.119 million Vietnamese Dong (95% CI: −26.841, 272.633), in which the highest number of mortality and morbidity due to PM10 dust pollution exposure was identified on October 24, 2017. The WRF/CMAQ simulation results were calibrated and validated to improve the efficiency of the estimation. These validated results were mainly based on the measured data, which played a significant role in enhancing the accuracy of the quantification of air pollution effects.},

After national social lockdown started in India, air quality improved drastically. This further hypothesized to influence the environment and human health, and this study is positively the first to weigh it using multiple indices. The calculated environmental indices are photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP), acidification potential (AP), and eutrophication potential (EP). The cancer risk, chronic health index (CHI), and acute health index (AHI) were considered to calculate the health risk. The spatial trend change in the air pollution reflecting on these indices are calculated for four Indian megacities Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Kolkata. Temporal variation was accounted for monthly (2019 vs 2020), one-week and two-weeks period during the social lockdown. The results showed a significant decrease in environmental and health risk during the lockdown due to a corresponding decrement in air pollution. The decrease in the particulate matter was found to play a vital role in altering the air pollution mediated risks of interest. Delhi showed a maximum difference in POCP and Acute HI by recording a dip of 70.79% and 43.53% respectively in 2020 during lockdown. The maximum reduction in health risk indices was 41%, 31%, 17%, 19% for Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Kolkata. Bangalore recorded the maximum decline in EP, Cancer risk, Chronic HI by 66.66%, 58.62%, and 58.76% in 2020 compared to 2019. A maximum fall in AP was seen in Kolkata by 57.23% in 2020 among all cities. The connection between these drop-in indices and the cause of air pollutants were well discussed. This present paper gives more in-depth insights into air pollution's effect on environmental and health parameters by connecting and converging various air pollution aspects into a single scale. This study also enlightens the importance of controlling air pollution to have a better environment and healthy life to attain sustainable development.},

Subgroup analyses stratified by sex, age and season were conducted to examine the effect modifications. Results: Overall, we found that short-term exposure to air pollution including SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and PM2.5 was significantly associated with hospital visits for PUD among all subjects. The lag-response effects of SO2, NO2 and O3 varied at different concentrations and lag days. The cumulative risk ratios of CO and PM2.5 showed nearly linear adverse effects and increased to maxima of 2.68 (95% CI: 1.49–4.78) and 2.40 (95% CI: 1.36–4.24) with their ranges from the references to the maximum concentrations, respectively. Moreover, the cumulative risks of particulate matters on hospital visits for PUD increased significantly in cold seasons, but not in warm seasons. Conclusions: Our findings could provide growing evidence regarding the adverse health effects of air pollution on PUD, thereby strengthening the hypothesis that air pollutants have harmful impacts on digestive system.},

abstract = {Acute health effects of air pollution on diabetes risk have not been fully studied in developing countries and the results remain inconsistent. This study aimed to investigate the association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mortality in China. Data on T2DM mortality from 2013 to 2019 were obtained from the Cause of Death Reporting System (CDRS) of Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Air pollution data for the same period were collected from 10 national air quality monitoring stations of Wuhan Ecology and Environment Institute, including daily average PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2. Meteorological data including daily average temperature and relative humidity were collected from Wuhan Meteorological Bureau. Generalized additive models (GAM) based on quasi-Poisson distribution were applied to evaluate the association between short-term exposure to air pollution and daily T2DM deaths. A total of 9837 T2DM deaths were recorded during the study period in Wuhan. We found that short-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 were positively associated with T2DM mortality, and gaseous pollutants appeared to have greater effects than particulate matter (PM). For the largest effect, per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increment in PM2.5 (lag 02), PM10 (lag 02), SO2 (lag 03), and NO2 (lag 02) were significantly associated with 1.099% (95% CI: 0.451, 1.747), 1.016% (95% CI: 0.517, 1.514), 3.835% (95% CI: 1.480, 6.189), and 1.587% (95% CI: 0.646, 2.528) increase of daily T2DM deaths, respectively. Stratified analysis showed that females or elderly population aged 65 and above were more susceptible to air pollution exposure. In conclusion, short-term exposure to air pollution was significantly associated with a higher risk of T2DM mortality. Further research is required to verify our findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.},

abstract = {Evidence from cohort studies on the effects of long-term exposure to air pollution on mortality is limited in South Korea, which has high concentration of particles compared to North America, Western Europe, and Japan, and low exposure compared to China. To reduce knowledge gaps between other countries and South Korea, we investigated the association between all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality and long-term exposure to PM10 and, as a surrogate for fine particles from local emission sources, SO2 and NO2. Participants comprised 18,220 subjects (97,114.4 person-years) residing in 73 districts of seven major cities of South Korea who were assigned to measurements of fixed-site monitoring stations and followed up. We applied Cox proportional hazard models with time-varying exposure up to three years average of air pollutants. We adjusted for individual and district-level covariates measured at baseline such as age, sex, socioeconomic positions, and health behaviors. We found that hazard ratios of PM10 and SO2 for all-cause mortality leveled off over approximately 5 ppb of SO2 and 35–50 $\mu$g/m3 of PM10. Interquartile range increases of PM10 (5.05 $\mu$g/m3), SO2 (2.09 ppb), and NO2 (11.41 ppb) were associated with 14.4% (95% CI: −0.4, 31.4), 18.1% (−4.5, 46.0), and 18.9% (−8.7, 54.7) increases in cardiovascular mortality, respectively. We did not find positive associations for respiratory mortality. The increase in cardiovascular mortality varied by sex (for PM10, in females, 27.4% (5.8, 53.5) increase), smoking (in non-smokers, 35.9% (12.7, 64.0) increase), drinking (in drinkers, 24.5% (2.1, 51.8) increase), marital status (in those not married, 23.1% (1.1, 49.9)), employment status (for SO2, in those employed, 79.4% (16.1, 177.3) increase), body mass index (in those ≥23, 47.6% (10.4, 97.3) increase), and community deprivation (for PM10, in less deprived communities, 21.0% (1.3, 44.4) increase). In summary, long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with mortality risk in South Korea. Our results suggest that the health effect of long-term exposure to air pollution may not be equal by sex, health behaviors and socioeconomic positions.},

abstract = {Exposure to air pollution has been associated with increased risk for a range of adverse mental health conditions. Less is known about whether air pollution is also associated with increases in the utilization of mental health services, especially outpatient mental health service utilization. This study aimed to examine the association between the number of daily outpatient visits at the psychological disease departments of two major hospitals (PSYC) and daily average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 in a heavily polluted city in China, Nanjing, from 2013/7/1 to 2019/2/28, using generalized additive models with a quasi-Poisson regression. Results showed that each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration on lag0 day was associated with a 0.40% increase (95% CI: 0.07-0.72) in PSYC visits, and each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10 concentration on the same day a 0.31% increase (95% CI: 0.09-0.54) in PSYC visits. Exposure-response curves suggested linear relationships between PM concentration and daily PSYC outpatient visits, without evidence of a threshold. Associations remained positive, but were non-significant, with adjustment for co-pollutants, SO2, NO2 and CO. Significantly larger effects were found for older and male participants, vs. their counterparts. These findings add to the growing literature linking air pollution to mental health service utilization, demonstrating the critical need for both air pollution mitigation measures and increased capacity of the mental health system in China.},

abstract = {Background
Air pollution has already become a serious public health concern worldwide, while evidence for the association between air pollution and digestive disease is not consistent.
Objective
To examine the association between air pollution and peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB).
Methods
We performed a time-stratified case-crossover study among 1,246,270 gastroscopy records in Zhejiang, China from January 1st, 2013 to June 30th, 2019. Individual exposure to air pollution for each subject was estimated by using data from 55 fixed-sites with an inverse distance weighted method. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for PUB associated with an interquartile range (IQR) increase in air pollution on the entire population. Subgroup analyses were performed for season, age and sex.
Results
Totally 3543 patients diagnosed with PUB were included in the analyses. Significant associations were observed between NO2, CO and PM2.5 and the risk of PUB. The effect was observed strongest measured as lag06 and an IQR increase of 7-day moving average concentrations of NO2 resulted in a 24.0% increase of getting PUB (95% CI: 2.6%–50.0%).
Significance
Our findings strengthen the hypothesis that short-term air pollution exposure has adverse health effects on digestive system.},

abstract = {Ambient ozone (O3) pollution has become a big issue in China. Recent studies have linked long- and short-term O3 exposure to several public health risks. In this study, we (1) characterize the long-term and short-term O3-attributed health metric in China from 2015 to 2019; (2) estimate the surface O3 trends; and (3) quantify the long-term and short-term health impacts (i.e. all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality) in 350 urban Chinese cities. In these 5-years, the national annual average of daily maximum 8 h average (AVGDMA8) O3 concentrations and warm-season (April–September) 4th highest daily maximum 8 h average (4DMA8) O3 concentrations increased from 74.0 ± 15.5 $\mu$g/m3 (mean ± standard deviation) to 82.3 ± 12.0 $\mu$g/m3 and 167 ± 37.0 $\mu$g/m3 to 174 ± 30.0 $\mu$g/m3 respectively. During this period, the DMA8 O3 concentration increased by 1.9 ± 3.3 $\mu$g/m3/yr across China, with over 70% of the monitoring sites showing a positive upward trend and 19.4% with trends >5 $\mu$g/m3/yr. The estimated long-term all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory premature mortalities attributable to AVGDMA8 O3 exposure in 350 Chinese cities were 181,000 (95% CI: 91,500–352,000), 112,000 (95% CI: 38,100–214,000) and 33,800 (95% CI: 0–71,400) in 2019, showing increases of 52.5%, 52.9% and 54.6% respectively compared to 2015 levels. Similarly, short-term all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory premature mortalities attributed to ambient 4DMA8 O3 exposure were 156,000 (95% CI: 85,300–227,000), 73,500 (95% CI: 27,500–119,000) and 28,600 (95% CI: 14,500–42,800) in 2019, increases of 19.6%, 19.8% and 21.2% respectively compared to 2015.

abstract = {Background
Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including disease aggravation in Parkinson's disease (PD), but associations with specific PM2.5 components have not been evaluated.
Objective
To characterize the association between specific PM2.5 components and PD first hospitalization, a surrogate for disease aggravation.
Methods
We obtained data on hospitalizations from the New York Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (2000–2014) to calculate annual first PD hospitalization counts in New York State per county. We used well-validated prediction models at 1 km2 resolution to estimate county level population-weighted annual black carbon (BC), organic matter (OM), nitrate, sulfate, sea salt (SS), and soil particle concentrations. We then used a multi-pollutant mixed quasi-Poisson model with county-specific random intercepts to estimate rate ratios (RR) of one-year exposure to each PM2.5 component and PD disease aggravation. We evaluated potential nonlinear exposure–outcome relationships using penalized splines and accounted for potential confounders.
Results
We observed a total of 197,545 PD first hospitalizations in NYS from 2000 to 2014. The annual average count per county was 212 first hospitalizations. The RR (95% confidence interval) for PD aggravation was 1.06 (1.03, 1.10) per one standard deviation (SD) increase in nitrate concentrations and 1.06 (1.04, 1.09) for the corresponding increase in OM concentrations. We also found a nonlinear inverse association between PD aggravation and BC at concentrations above the 96th percentile. We found a marginal association with SS and no association with sulfate or soil exposure.
Conclusion
In this study, we detected associations between the PM2.5 components OM and nitrate with PD disease aggravation. Our findings support that PM2.5 adverse effects on PD may vary by particle composition.},

abstract = {India enforced stringent lockdown measures on March 24, 2020 to mitigate the spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronovirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we examined the impact of lockdown on the air quality index (AQI) [including ambient particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and ammonia (NH3)] and tropospheric NO2 and O3 densities through Sentinel-5 satellite data approximately 1 d post-lockdown and one month pre-lockdown and post-lockdown. Our findings revealed a marked reduction in the ambient AQI (estimated mean reduction of 17.75% and 20.70%, respectively), tropospheric NO2 density, and land surface temperature (LST) during post-lockdown compared with the pre-lockdown period or corresponding months in 2019, except for a few sites with substantial coal mining and active power plants. We observed a modest increase in the O3 density post-lockdown, thereby indicating improved tropospheric air quality. As a favorable outcome of the COVID-19 lockdown, road accident-related mortalities declined by 72-folds. Cities with poor air quality correlate with higher COVID-19 cases and deaths (r = 0.504 and r = 0.590 for NO2; r = 0.744 and r = 0.435 for AQI). Conversely, low mortality was reported in cities with better air quality. These results show a correlation between the COVID-19 vulnerable regions and AQI hotspots, thereby suggesting that air pollution may exacerbate clinical manifestations of the disease. However, a prolonged lockdown may nullify the beneficial environmental outcomes by adversely affecting socioeconomic and health aspects.},

Short-term exposure to high Particulate Matter (PM) concentrations worsens several respiratory conditions.
Objectives
We evaluated the relationship between short-term exposure to Particulate Matter and fine Particulate Matter (PM10 – PM2.5) and Emergency Department (ED) admissions and hospitalizations for COPD exacerbation observed at the University Hospital, Spedali Civili of Brescia, a city with some of the highest yearly levels of air pollution in Italy.
Methods
We collected data from patients admitted to the ED with a COPD exacerbation diagnosis, starting from January 2014 to January 2016. Daily PM levels were collected from the Environmental Protection Regional Agency (ARPA). We performed a time-series analysis using the Poisson regression model with single and multiple day-lag. Results were expressed as Relative Risk (RR) and Excess of Relative Risk (ER) for COPD exacerbation-related ED admissions and hospitalizations, over a 10$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM concentration.
Results
We collected data from 431 COPD patients. Both PM10 and PM2.5 were significantly associated with the risk of COPD exacerbation-related ED admission and hospitalization. Each increase of 10$\mu$g/m3 of PM10 and PM2.5 corresponded respectively to a RR for ED admissions of 1.06 and 1.08 at lag0-1; 1.06 and 1.09 at lag0-5 (p < 0.05). Similar results for COPD Exacerbation-related hospitalizations were found, with a RR of 1.07 and 1.10 at lag0-1 and 1.07 and 1.11 at lag0-5 for each increase of 10$\mu$g/m3 PM10 and PM2.5, respectively.
Conclusions
Our findings show that in a highly polluted city of Northern Italy, short-term increase in exposure to PM10-PM2.5 is associated with a higher risk of ED admission and hospitalization due to COPD exacerbation with a greater incidence during the winter season.},

This meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively evaluate the correlation between maternal air pollutant exposure and PTB, and provide evidence of higher grade to help improving the pregnancy outcomes. Databases including Web of Science and PubMed were searched to retrieve eligible studies published up to October 2020. The quality of the articles was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Score (NOS), after which the pooled estimate of the effect was calculated. The robustness of the joint estimates was confirmed by sensitivity analysis of excluded studies one by one, and the sources of heterogeneity were discussed by stratification analysis. Egger's and Begg's tests were performed to examine publication bias. Sixty studies that met the eligible criteria were finally included in this study. The findings showed combined relative risks of 1.032–1.070 for PTB, 0.859–1.081 for moderate PTB, 1.119–1.194 for very PTB and 1.128–1.259 for extremely PTB when mothers were exposed to PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3, SO2, CO and NOx during pregnancy, while the sensitive windows varied for different air pollutants. Notably, PM2.5 exposure in only the 2nd trimester, NO2 exposure in only the 3rd trimester, and O3 exposure in all three trimesters were positively associated with PTB, while NO2 exposure in the 1st trimester was negatively associated with PTB. In addition, exposure of PM2.5 and PM10 in the 2nd trimester was positively associated with moderate PTB, and in the 1st and 2nd trimesters were positively associated with very PTB. These findings demonstrated that PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2 were associated with PTB (including moderate PTB, very PTB, and/or extremely PTB), while NOx was not, and the relationship between CO and SO2 and PTB was not stable.},

abstract = {Background
Long-term exposure to ambient and household particulate matter (PM2.5) causes death and health loss, and both are the leading risk factor to global disease burden. We assessed spatiotemporal trends of ambient and household PM2.5 attributable burdens across various diseases at the global, regional, and national levels from 1990 to 2017.
Methods
Data on PM2.5-attributable disease burdens were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2017. Numbers and age-standardized rates (ASRs) of deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and corresponding estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) were estimated by disease, age, sex, Socio-demographic Index (SDI), locations.
Results
Exposure to PM2.5 contributed to 4.58 million deaths and 142.52 million DALYs globally in 2017, among which ambient PM2.5 contributed to 64.2% deaths and 58.3% DALYs. ASRs of deaths and DALYs in 2017 decreased to 59.62/105 persons with an EAPC of −2.15 (95% CI: 2.21 to −2.09) and 1856.61/105 persons with an EAPC of −2.58 (95% CI: 2.64 to −2.51), respectively compared to those in 1990. Ambient PM2.5-attributable Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have dominated major concern in middle and low SDI countries especially in South Asia and East Asia, while household PM2.5-attributable lower respiratory infections (LRIs) still caused the largest burden in low SDI countries in Africa and Asia. Those under 5 and over 70 years old had the largest burdens in PM2.5 attributable LRI and NCDs, respectively.
Conclusion
In conclusion, ambient PM2.5-attributable NCDs have threatened public health in middle and low SDI countries, while household PM2.5-attributable LRI still caused the largest burden in low SDI countries. More positive strategies should be tailored to reduce PM2.5-attributable burdens considering specific settings globally.},

abstract = {The impact of air pollution on humans is a worrisome factor that has gained prominence over the years due to the importance of the topic to society. Lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are among the diseases associated with pollution that increase the mortality rate in Brazil and worldwide. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the impacts of air pollutants on mortality rates from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer (LC) using vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling. The adjusted model was a VAR(1) and, according to the Granger causality test, the air pollutants selected were PM10, O3, CO, NO2, and SO2. The shocks applied to the variables O3, using the impulse response function, negatively impacted COPD; in the eighth period, which is stabilized. The LC variable suffered more significant variations from O3 and after a shock in this variable, an initially negative response in LC occurred and the series stabilized in period nine. After one year, 20.19% of COPD variance was explained by O3. After twelve months, the atmospheric pollutant O3 represented 5.00% and NO2 represented 4.02% of LC variance. Moreover, the variables that caused the highest impact on COPD and LC mortality rates were O3 and NO2, indicating that air pollution influences the clinical state of people who have these diseases and even contributes to their development. The VAR model was able to identify the air pollutants that have the most significant impact on the diseases analyzed and explained the interrelationship between them.},

Recent studies have investigated the potential neurological impacts of short-term exposure to air pollutants, but with limited evidence.
Objective
To analyze the relationship and quantify the short-term association of air pollution (PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and ozone) and hospital admissions for Parkinson's disease (PD), in 18 French areas.
Methods
We modeled the daily number of PD-related hospital admissions in each area using a generalized additive Poisson regression model for the 2009–2017 period, introducing air pollutants as the main environmental variable and daily temperature as covariate. We controlled for long-term trend and seasonality.
Results
A small but significant influence of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 on all-ages PD hospital admissions was observed, of a similar order of magnitude (1.010 [95% CI: 1.004; 1.016], 1.010 [1.003; 1.017], and 1.011 [1.005; 1.016] for a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10, PM2.5 and NO2, respectively). We also found an increase in hospitalization risks, at the limit of significance, associated with ozone (1.001 [95% CI: 0.999; 1.004]).
Conclusion
Our results suggest a short-term association between PM, NO2, ozone and daily hospital admissions due to PD.},

abstract = {Background
Results from observational and experimental studies indicate that exposure to air pollutants during gestation reduces birth weight, whereas little is known on potential cardiometabolic consequences for the offspring at adulthood.
Objectives
Our aim was to evaluate the long-term effects of gestational exposure to diesel engine exhaust (DE) on adult offspring phenotype in a rabbit model.
Methods
The protocol was designed to mimic human exposure in large European cities. Females rabbits were exposed to diluted (1 mg/m3) DE (exposed, n = 9) or clean air (controls, n = 7), from 3 days after mating, 2 h/d and 5 d/wk in a nose-only inhalation system throughout gestation (gestation days 3–27). After birth and weaning, 72 offspring (47 exposed and 25 controls) were raised until adulthood (7.5 months) to evaluate their cardio-metabolic status, including the monitoring of body weight and food intake, fasting biochemistry, body composition (iDXA), cardiovascular parameters and glucose tolerance. After a metabolic challenge (high fat diet in males and gestation in females), animals were euthanized for postmortem phenotyping.
Results
Sex-specific responses to maternal exposure were observed in adult offspring. Age-related increases in blood pressure (p = 0.058), glycaemia (p = 0.029), and perirenal fat mass (p = 0.026) as well as reductions in HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.025) and fat-to-body weight ratio (p = 0.011) were observed in exposed males, suggesting a metabolic syndrome. Almost only trends were observed in exposed females with higher triglycerides and decreased bone density compared to control females. Metabolic challenges triggered or amplified some biological responses, especially in females.
Conclusions
In utero exposure to air pollution predisposed rabbit offspring to cardiometabolic disorders in a sex-specific manner.},

Limited evidence is known about whether long-term exposures to air borne particulate matters of 2.5 $\mu$m or less (PM2.5) impact human hematologic index for women preparing for pregnancy. No study assessed the effect of PM1, which is small enough to reach the blood circulation.
Objective
To evaluate whether exposure to PM1 and PM2.5 is associated with blood cell count of woman preparing for pregnancy.
Method
Based on the baseline data of a national birth cohort in China, we analysed the white blood cell (WBC), red blood cells (RBC) and thrombocyte counts of 1,203,565 women who are aged 18–45 years, being Han ethnicity, had no chronic disease and preparing for pregnancy. We matched their home addresses and examination date with daily concentrations of PM1 and PM2.5 which were estimated by a machine learning method with remote sensing, meteorological and land use information. Generalized additive mixed model to examine the associations between exposure to one-year average exposure to PMs prior to the health examination and the blood cells counts, after adjustment for potential individual variables.
Results
A 10 $\mu$g/m3 PM1 increment was associated with −1.49% (95%CI: 1.56%, −1.42%) difference in WBC count; with 0.33% (95%CI: 0.30%, 0.36%) difference of RBC count; and with 1.08% (95%CI: 1.01%, 1.15%) difference of thrombocyte count. For PM2.5, the corresponding difference was −0.47% (95%CI: 0.54%, −0.39%) for WBC; was 0.06% (95%CI: 0.03%, 0.09%) for RBC; and was 1.10% (95%CI: 1.02%, 1.18%) for thrombocyte. Women working as workers, being overweight and with tobacco smoking exposure had higher associations between PMs and hematologic index than their counterparts (p < 0.05 for interaction test).
Conclusion
Long-term exposure to PMs were associated with decrement in WBC, as well as increment in RBC and thrombocytes among Han Chinese women preparing for pregnancy. Measures such as using air purifiers and wearing a mask in polluted areas should be improved to prevent women from the impact of PMs.},

abstract = {The reduction of NOx emissions in a VOC-limited region can lead to an increase of the local O3 concentration. An evaluation of the net health effects of such pollutant changes is therefore important to ascertain whether the emission control measures effectively improve the overall protection of public health. In this study, we use a short-term health risk (added health risk or AR) model developed for the multi-pollutant air quality health index (AQHI) in Hong Kong to examine the overall health impacts of these pollutant changes. We first investigate AR changes associated with NO2 and O3 changes, followed by those associated with changes in all four AQHI pollutants (NO2, O3, SO2, and particulate matter (PM)). Our results show that for the combined health effects of NO2 and O3 changes, there is a significant reduction in AR in urban areas with dense traffic, but no statistically significant changes in other less urbanized areas. The increase in estimated AR for higher O3 concentrations is offset by a decrease in the estimated AR for lower NO2 concentrations. In areas with dense traffic, the reduction in AR as a result of decreased NO2 is substantially larger than the increase in AR associated with increased O3. When additionally accounting for the change in ambient SO2 and PM, we found a statistically significant reduction in total AR everywhere in Hong Kong. Our results show that the emission control measures resulting in NO2, SO2, and PM reductions over the past decade have effectively reduced the AR over Hong Kong, even though these control measures may have partially contributed to an increase in O3 concentrations. Hence, efforts to reduce NOx, SO2, and PM should be continued.},

abstract = {Background
Hazards of traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) on the developing immune system are poorly understood. We sought to investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to TRAP on cord blood immune cell distributions; and to identify gestational windows of susceptibility.
Methods
In-depth immunophenotyping of cord blood leukocyte and lymphocyte subsets was performed by flow cytometry in 190 newborns embedded in the Nutrition in Early Life and Asthma (NELA) birth cohort (2015–2018). Long-term (whole pregnancy and trimesters) and short-term (15-days before delivery) residential exposures to traffic-related nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), and ozone (O3) were estimated using dispersion/chemical transport modelling. Associations between TRAP concentrations and cord blood immune cell counts were assessed using multivariate Poisson regression models.
Results
Mean number of natural killer (NK) cells decreased 15% in relation to higher NO2 concentrations (≥36.4 $\mu$g/m3) during whole pregnancy (incidence relative risk (IRR), 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72, 0.99), with stronger associations in the first trimester. Higher PM2.5 concentrations (≥13.3 $\mu$g/m3) during whole pregnancy associated with a reduced mean number of cytotoxic T cells (IRR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78, 0.99). Newborns exposed to higher PM10 (≥23.6 $\mu$g/m3) and PM2.5 concentrations during the first and third trimester showed greater mean number of helper T type 1 (Th1) cells (P < 0.05). Decreased number of regulatory T (Treg) cells was associated with greater short-term NO2 (IRR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.80, 1.01) and PM10 (IRR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77, 0.99) concentrations.
Conclusions
Prenatal exposure to TRAP, particularly in early and late gestation, impairs fetal immune system development through disturbances in cord blood leukocyte and lymphocyte distributions.},

abstract = {Exposure to indoor air pollution is known to affect respiratory and cardiovascular health, but little is known about its effects on cognitive function. We measured the concentrations and magnetite content of airborne particulate matter (PM) in the indoor environment arising from burning peat, wood or coal in residential open fires. Highest indoor PM2.5 concentrations (60 $\mu$g/m3 i.e. 2.4 times the WHO-recommended 24-h mean) occurred when peat was burned, followed by burning of coal (30 $\mu$g/m3) and wood (17 $\mu$g/m3). Conversely, highest concentrations of coarser PM (PM10-2.5) were associated with coal burning (20 $\mu$g/m3), with lower concentrations emitted during burning of wood (10 $\mu$g/m3) and peat (8 $\mu$g/m3). The magnetic content of the emitted PM, greatest (for both PM size fractions) when coal was burned, is similar to that of roadside airborne PM. Exposure to PM, and to strongly magnetic airborne PM, can be greater for individuals spending $\sim$5 h/day indoors with a coal-burning open fire for 6 months/year compared to those commuting via heavily-trafficked roads for 1 h/day for 12 months/year. Given these high indoor PM and magnetite concentrations, and the reported associations between (outdoor) PM and impaired neurological health, we used individual-level data from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA) to examine the association between the usage of open fires and the cognitive function of older people. Using a sample of nearly seven thousand older people, we estimated multi-variate models of the association between cognitive function and open fire usage, in order to account for relevant confounders such as socio-economic status. We found a negative association between open fire usage and cognitive function as measured by widely-used cognitive tests such as word recall and verbal fluency tests. The negative association was largest and statistically strongest among women, a finding explained by the greater exposure of women to open fires in the home because they spent more time at home than men. Our findings were also robust to stratifying the sample between old and young, rich and poor, and urban and rural.},

abstract = {In the past decade, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) has reached unprecedented levels in China and posed a significant threat to public health. Exploring the long-term trajectory of the PM2.5 attributable health burden and corresponding disparities across populations in China yields insights for policymakers regarding the effectiveness of efforts to reduce air pollution exposure. Therefore, we examine how the magnitude and equity of the PM2.5-related public health burden has changed nationally, and between provinces, as economic growth and pollution levels varied during 2005–2017. We derive long-term PM2.5 exposures in China from satellite-based observations and chemical transport models, and estimate attributable premature mortality using the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM). We characterize national and interprovincial inequality in health outcomes using environmental Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients over the study period. PM2.5 exposure is linked to 1.8 (95% CI: 1.6, 2.0) million premature deaths over China in 2017, increasing by 31% from 2005. Approximately 70% of PM2.5 attributable deaths were caused by stroke and IHD (ischemic heart disease), though COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and LRI (lower respiratory infection) disproportionately affected poorer provinces. While most economic gains and PM2.5-related deaths were concentrated in a few provinces, both gains and deaths became more equitably distributed across provinces over time. As a nation, however, trends toward equality were more recent and less clear cut across causes of death. The rise in premature mortality is due primarily to population growth and baseline risks of stroke and IHD. This rising health burden could be alleviated through policies to prevent pollution, exposure, and disease. More targeted programs may be warranted for poorer provinces with a disproportionate share of PM2.5-related premature deaths due to COPD and LRI.},

We investigated the association between 24-h average personal UFP, PM2.5, and soot exposure and dose and the health parameters blood pressure and lung function. We further assessed the short-term associations between outdoor concentrations measured at a central monitoring site and near the residences and these health outcomes. We performed three 24-h personal exposure measurements for UFP, PM2.5, and soot in 132 healthy adults from Basel (Switzerland), Amsterdam and Utrecht (the Netherlands), and Turin (Italy). Monitoring of each subject was conducted in different seasons in a one-year study period. Subject's activity levels and associated ventilation rates were measured using actigraphy to calculate the inhaled dose. After each 24-h monitoring session, blood pressure and lung function were measured. Contemporaneously with personal measurements, UFP, PM2.5 and soot were measured outdoor at the subject's residential address and at a central site in the research area. Associations between short-term personal and outdoor exposure and dose to UFP, PM2.5, and soot and health outcomes were tested using linear mixed effect models. The 24-h mean personal, residential and central site outdoor UFP exposures were not associated with blood pressure or lung function. UFP mean exposures in the 2-h prior to the health test was also not associated with blood pressure and lung function. Personal, central site and residential PM2.5 exposure were positively associated with systolic blood pressure (about 1.4 mmHg increase per Interquartile range). Personal soot exposure and dose were positively associated with diastolic blood pressure (1.2 and 0.9 mmHg increase per Interquartile range). No consistent associations between PM2.5 or soot exposure and lung function were observed.

Higher levels of particulate matter of diameter ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10) (RR, 1.009; 95% CI, 1.007–1.012), ozone (1.028; 1.023–1.033), and sulfur dioxide (1.033; 1.030–1.037) were significantly associated with increased risk of medical care visits for AD on same days. In all age and sex groups, ozone was associated with a significantly higher risk of medical care visits, with the greatest risk among 13- to 18-year-old males (RR, 1.127; 95% CI, 1.095–1.159).
Conclusion
This study suggests relationships of ambient PM10, ozone, and sulfur dioxide levels with medical care visits for AD.},

abstract = {Background
Air pollution is associated with mental health in the general population, but its influence on maternal mental health during pregnancy has not been assessed.
Objective
We evaluated the relationship between unspecified mental disorders complicating pregnancy and depression with average air pollution exposure during 3-months preconception, first trimester and whole pregnancy.
Methods
Ambient air pollution was derived from a modified Community Multiscale Air Quality model and mental health diagnoses were based on electronic intrapartum medical records. Logistic regression models assessed the odds of unspecified mental disorder complicating pregnancy (n = 11,577) and depression (n = 9793) associated with an interquartile range increase in particulate matter (PM) less than 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), PM10, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3). Pregnancies without mental health disorders were the reference group (n = 211,645). Models were adjusted for maternal characteristics and study site; analyses were repeated using cases with no additional mental health co-morbidity.
Results
Whole pregnancy exposure to PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and NOx was associated with a 29%–74% increased odds of unspecified mental disorders complicating pregnancy while CO was associated with 31% decreased odds. Results were similar for depression: whole pregnancy exposure to PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and NOx was associated with 11%–21% increased odds and CO and O3 were associated with 16%–20% decreased odds. SO2 results were inconsistent, with increased odds for unspecified mental disorders complicating pregnancy and decreased odds for depression. While most findings were similar or stronger among cases with no co-morbidity, PM2.5 and NOx were associated with reduced risk and SO2 with increased risk for depression only.
Discussion
Whole pregnancy exposure to PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and NOx were associated with unspecified mental disorder complicating pregnancy and depression, but some results varied for depression only. These risks merit further investigation.},

abstract = {Exposure to air pollutants may be associated with preterm birth (PB) through oxidative stress, metabolic detoxification, and immune system processes. However, no study has investigated the interactive effects of maternal air pollution and genetic polymorphisms in these pathways on risk of PB. The study included 126 PB and 310 term births. A total of 177 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in oxidative stress, immune function, and metabolic detoxification-related genes were examined and analyzed. The China air quality index (AQI) was used as an overall estimation of ambient air pollutants. Among 177 SNPs, four SNPs (GPX4-rs376102, GLRX-rs889224, VEGFA-rs3025039, and IL1A-rs3783550) were found to have significant interactions with AQI on the risk of PB (Pinteraction were 0.001, 0.003, 0.03, and 0.04, respectively). After being stratified by the maternal genotypes in these four SNPs, 1.38 to 1.76 times of the risk of PB were observed as per interquartile range increase in maternal AQI among women who carried the GPX4-rs376102 AC/CC genotypes, the GLRX-rs889224 TT genotype, the VEGFA-rs3025039 CC genotype, or the IL1A-rs3783550 GT/TT genotypes. After adjustment for multiple comparisons, only GPX4-rs376102 and AQI interaction remained statistically significant (false discovery rate (FDR)=0.17). After additional stratification by preeclampsia (PE) status, a strongest association was observed in women who carried the GPX4-rs376102 AC/CC genotypes (OR, 2.26; 95% CI, 1.41–3.65, Pinteraction=0.0002, FDR=0.035) in the PE group. Our study provided the first evidence that association between maternal air pollution and PB risk may be modified by the genetic polymorphisms in oxidative stress and immune function genes. Future large studies are necessary to replicate and confirm the observed associations.},

abstract = {Exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) may enhance the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the short-term effects of TRAP components on the cardiovascular system are not well understood. We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, crossover intervention study in which 39 healthy university students spent 2 h next to a busy road. Participants wore a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) or an N95 mask. PAPRs were equipped with a filter for particulate matter (PM), a PM and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) filter or a sham filter. Participants were blinded to PAPR filter type and underwent randomized exposures four times, once for each intervention mode. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) were measured before, during and for 6 h after the roadside exposure. Linear mixed-effect models were used to evaluate the effects of the interventions relative to baseline controlling for other covariates. All HRV measures increased during and following exposure for all intervention modes. Some HRV measures (SDNN and rMSSD during exposure and SDNN after exposure) were marginally affected by PM filtration. Wearing the N95 mask affected VLF power and rMSSD responses to traffic exposure differently than the PAPR interventions. Both systolic and diastolic BP increased slightly during exposure, but then were generally lower than baseline after exposure for the sham and filter interventions. HR, which fell during exposure and mostly remained lower than baseline after exposure, was lower yet with all filter interventions compared to the sham mode following exposure. Therefore, short-term exposure to traffic acutely affects HRV, BP and HR, but N95 mask and PAPR interventions generally show little efficacy in reducing these effects. Removing the PM component of TRAP has some limited effects on HRV responses to exposure but exaggerates the traffic-related decrease in HR. HRV findings from N95 mask interventions need to be interpreted cautiously.},

abstract = {This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between air pollution and DNA methylation in adults from published observational studies. PubMed, Web of Science and Embase databases were systematically searched for available studies on the association between air pollution and DNA methylation published up to March 9, 2021. Three DNA methylation approaches were considered: global methylation, candidate-gene, and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). Meta-analysis was used to summarize the combined estimates for the association between air pollutants and global DNA methylation levels. Heterogeneity was assessed with the Cochran Q test and quantified with the I2 statistic. In total, 38 articles were included in this study: 16 using global methylation, 18 using candidate genes, and 11 using EWAS, with 7 studies using more than one approach. Meta-analysis revealed an imprecise but inverse association between exposure to PM2.5 and global DNA methylation (for each 10-$\mu$g/m3 PM2.5, combined estimate: 0.39; 95% confidence interval: 0.97 - 0.19). The candidate-gene results were consistent for the ERCC3 and SOX2 genes, suggesting hypermethylation in ERCC3 associated with benzene and that in SOX2 associated with PM2.5 exposure. EWAS identified 201 CpG sites and 148 differentially methylated regions that showed differential methylation associated with air pollution. Among the 307 genes investigated in 11 EWAS, a locus in nucleoredoxin gene was found to be positively associated with PM2.5 in two studies. Current meta-analysis indicates that PM2.5 is imprecisely and inversely associated with DNA methylation. The candidate-gene results consistently suggest hypermethylation in ERCC3 associated with benzene exposure and that in SOX2 associated with PM2.5 exposure. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) network analyses revealed that these genes were associated with African trypanosomiasis, Malaria, Antifolate resistance, Graft-versus-host disease, and so on. More evidence is needed to clarify the association between air pollution and DNA methylation.},

This study aimed to investigate the short-term association between traffic-related air pollutants and hospital readmissions for RA in Hefei, China. Data on daily hospital readmissions for RA and traffic-related air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO), from 2014 to 2018 were retrieved. A time-series approach using generalized linear regression model was employed. The analysis was further stratified by sex, age and season. A total of 1153 readmissions for RA were reported during the study period. A significant association between high-concentration PM2.5 (90th percentile) and RA readmissions was observed on lag1 (relative risk (RR) = 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01–1.19) and lasted until lag3 (RR = 1.06, 95%CI: 1.01–1.12). From lag2 to lag5, high-concentration NO2 (90th percentile) was associated with increased risk of RA readmissions, with the highest RR observed at lag 4 (1.11, 95%CI: 1.05–1.17). Stratified analyses indicated that females and the elderly appeared to be more vulnerable to high-concentration PM2.5 and NO2 exposure. High-concentration PM2.5 and NO2 in cold seasons were consistently significantly associated with increased risk of RA readmissions. Exposure to high-concentration PM2.5 and NO2 was associated with increased risk of RA readmissions. Protective measures against the exposure to high-concentration PM2.5 and NO2 should be taken to reduce the recurrence risk in RA patients, especially in females, the elderly and during cold seasons.},

abstract = {Background
Global climate change could have potential impact on enterovirus (EV)-induced infectious diseases. However, the environmental factors promoting acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) circulation remain inconclusive. This study aimed to quantify the relationship between the environment and AHC.
Methods
We retrieved the monthly counts and incidence of AHC, meteorological variables and air quality in mainland China between 2013 and 2018. Exposure risks were evaluated by multivariate distributed lag nonlinear models.
Results
A total of 219,599 AHC cases were reported in 31 provinces of China, predominantly in southern and central China, seasonally increased in summer. AHC incidence increased by 7% between 2013 and 2018, from 2.6873 to 2.7570 per 100,000 people. A moderate positive correlation was seen between AHC and monthly mean temperature, relative humidity (RH) and precipitation. Each unit increment was associated with a relative risk for AHC of 1.058 at 17°-32 °C at lag 0 months, 1.017 at 65–71% RH at lag 1.4 months, and 1.039 at 400–569 mm at lag 2.4 months. By contrast, a negative correlation was seen between monthly ambient NO2 and AHC.
Conclusion
Long-term exposure to higher mean temperature, RH and precipitation were associated with an increased risk of AHC. The general public, especially susceptible populations, should pay close attention to weather changes and take protective measures in advance to any AHC outbreak as the above situations occur.},

Our results revealed that the population-weighted mean O3 concentrations in China and India were 49.2 and 63.4 ppb, respectively, in 2014.

The finding of 32.2% less O3-attributable mortality in China than in India was attributed to the combined effects of population size (+39.4%), population aging (+29.2%), baseline mortality rate (−43.7%), and ambient O3 exposure (−57.1%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that O3-related health burdens in China and India have been reported and compared at the provincial level.

We aim to assess whether changes in proinflammatory lipid signals are associated with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure in individuals with and without prediabetes. A longitudinal panel study was conducted in Beijing, China, and included 120 participants followed up over 589 clinical visits from August 2013 to February 2015. We measured 12 lipids derived from arachidonic acid pathways in blood samples of the participants via targeted lipidomic analyses. Ambient PM2.5 concentrations were continuously monitored at a station for associations with the lipids. Among the 120 participants, 110 (mean [SD] age at recruitment, 56.5 [4.2] years; 31 prediabetics) who visited the clinic at least twice over the follow-up period were assigned exposure values of the outdoor residential PM2.5 concentrations during the 1–14 days preceding each clinical visit. With an interquartile range increase in the 1-day-lag PM2.5 exposure (64.0 $\mu$g/m3), the prediabetic group had consistently greater increases in the concentration of arachidonate metabolites derived from the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) pathway (5,6-DHET, 15.8% [95% CI, 3.5–29.7%]; 8,9-DHET, 9.7% [95% CI, 0.6–19.6%]; 11,12-DHET, 8.3% [95% CI, 1.9–15.1%]; 14,15-DHET, 7.4% [95% CI, 0.9–14.4%]; and 20-HETE, 8.9% [95% CI, 1.0–17.5%]), compared with the healthy group. Among CYP450-derived lipids, 14,15-DHET and 20-HETE significantly mediated 8% and 8% of the PM2.5-associated increase in white blood cells, 10% and 13% of that in neutrophils, and 20% and 23% of that in monocytes, respectively, in the prediabetic group. In conclusion, proinflammatory lipid signals from CYP450 pathways triggered the health effects of particulate air pollution in individuals with prediabetes, suggesting that targeting lipid metabolism has therapeutic potential to attenuate or prevent the cardiovascular effects of air pollution in susceptible populations.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to air pollution and traffic noise are associated with adverse health outcomes in adolescents. Chronic endocrine stress and systemic inflammation have been hypothesized to underlie the adverse health effects. Simultaneous assessment of inflammation and chronic endocrine stress in epidemiological studies is lacking. The aim of the study was to investigate biomarkers of chronic endocrine stress and inflammation in relation to long-term residential exposure to air pollution and traffic noise in adolescents.
Methods
In Flemish adolescents (14–15 years), we determined hair cortisol concentration (HCC) as a chronic stress biomarker in 3-cm scalp-near hair sections (n = 395), and leucocyte and leucocyte subtype counts (neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes) as inflammatory biomarkers in peripheral blood (n = 385). Daily particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and black carbon (BC) concentrations were modelled at the residential address and averaged over 3-month and 1-year periods prior to sampling. Residential traffic noise level was estimated and classified in 5 dB intervals. Sex-specific associations between residential exposures and effect biomarkers were studied using linear regression models, adjusted for a priori selected covariates.
Results
In boys, HCC increased with a factor 1.30 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.54) for an increase in 1-year mean NO2 from the 25th to 75th percentile (p75/p25), after adjustment for age, BMI, personal and neighborhood socioeconomic status. The corresponding estimate for PM10 was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.51). Total leucocyte count in boys, adjusted for the aforementioned covariates and recent health complaints, was positively associated with PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and BC. In particular, the neutrophil count increased with a factor 1.11 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.19) for a (p75/p25)-factor increase in 1-year mean BC, corresponding estimates for PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 were 1.10 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.19), 1.10 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.20) and 1.08 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.16). Lymphocyte count increased with a factor 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.10) for a (p75/p25)-factor increase in 1-year mean NO2. Similar results were observed for 3-month mean exposures. Results were robust to adjustment for recent air pollution exposure. In girls, air pollutants were not associated with HCC or differential leucocyte count. Residential traffic noise level was not associated with HCC or leucocyte counts in boys nor girls.
Conclusions
Long-term residential exposure to air pollutants was positively associated with chronic endocrine stress and inflammation in adolescent boys, not in girls. This study may contribute to a better understanding of the early pathophysiological changes that may underlie adverse health effects of air pollution exposure in adolescents.},

Several studies have indicated that prenatal exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorder during pregnancy, preterm birth, and stillbirth. However, no previous study has focused on the association between the number of pregnancy complications and exposure to ambient air pollution.
Objectives
To investigate the association between prenatal exposure to ambient air pollutants and the number of pregnancy complications in high-risk pregnancies.
Methods
We collected data on gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorder during pregnancy, preterm birth, and stillbirth from the National Health Information Databases, provided by the Korean National Health Insurance Service.R To assess individual-level exposure to air pollutants, a spatial prediction model and area-averaging approach were used.
Results
From 2015 to 2018, data of 789,595 high-risk pregnancies were analyzed. The ratio of gestational diabetes mellitus in the country was the highest, followed by preterm birth, hypertensive disorder during pregnancy, and stillbirth. Approximately 71.7% of pregnant women (566,143) presented with one pregnancy complication in identical pregnancies, 27.5% (216,714) presented with two, and 0.9% (6738) presented with three or more. Multiple logistic regression models with adjustments for age, residence, and income variables indicated that the risk of having two or more pregnancy complications was positively associated with the exposure to higher levels of PM10 (odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09–1.12) and PM2.5 (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.12–1.15). The highest quartile presented higher odds of two or more pregnancy complications compared with the lower three quartiles of PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, and SO2 exposures (p < 0.001).
Conclusion
The results indicate that the risk of pregnancy complications is positively associated with the exposure to the high concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, CO, NO2, and SO2.},

abstract = {Background
Air pollution is one of the top 10 global health risk factors and has been associated with premature mortality, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, respiratory, and metabolic disease. Currently, there is a lack of health assessments on the public health impacts of air pollution in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Aim
This study aims to assess the ambient particulate matter burden of disease in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Methods
A comparative risk assessment (CRA) using the 2017 Global Burden of Disease was performed to estimate ambient particulate matter exposure, mortality, and lost years of a healthy life. Saudi Arabia population-weighted mean concentrations of particle mass with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2{\textperiodcentered}5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), at an approximate 11 km × 11 km resolution was estimated using satellite-based estimates, chemical transport models, and ground-level measurements. The CRA for PM2.5 was based on relative risks originated from epidemiological studies using integrated exposure-response functions for ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, lower respiratory infections, and type 2 diabetes. Mortality, years of life lost (YLL), years lived with disability (YLD) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to PM2.5 were estimated at the national level for all ages and both sexes from 1990 to 2017.
Results
In 2017, the annual exposure to ambient particulate matter in the population-weighted mean PM2.5 in Saudi Arabia was 87.9 $\mu$g/m3 (95% UI 29.6–197.9). The PM2.5 population-weighted mean has increased by 24% since 1990. Annual deaths attributable to PM2.5 were estimated at 8536 (95% UI 6046–11,080), representing 9% of the total annual deaths in Saudi Arabia. In 2017, 315,200 (95% UI 231,608–401,926) DALYs were attributable to PM2.5. Males contributed to 67% (209,822 (95% UI 151,322–277,503)) of DALYs, and females contributed to 33% (105,378 (95% UI 76,014–135,269) of DALYs. Ischemic heart disease represented 44% of the PM2.5 attributable DALYs, followed by type 2 diabetes (20%), lower respiratory infections (13%), stroke (11%), COPD (10%), and tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer (3%). In 2017, 240,966 (95% UI 168,833–319,178) years of life lost (YLL) and 74,234 (95% UI 50,229–100,410) years lived with disability (YLD) were attributed to PM2.5.
Conclusion
Ambient particulate matter is the fifth health risk factor in Saudi Arabia, contributing 9% of total mortality. Over the past 27 years, estimated exposure levels of PM2.5 in Saudi Arabia have been above WHO's air quality guidelines. Although since 2011 mortality and DALY rates attributable to PM2.5 have decreased, air pollution concentrations continue to increase. National and local authorities in Saudi Arabia should consider policies to reduce industrial and traffic-related air pollution in combination with the strengthening of current investments and improvements in health care and prevention services.},

abstract = {Introduction
Previous research suggested that an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) may be triggered by an exposure to ambient pollutants.
Objective
We investigated the link between OHCA and a short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) and other pollutants, within extreme climate conditions in Israel and high PM.
Methods
In a case-crossover analysis, we analyzed all adult cases of OHCA in Israel during 2016–2017. The air-pollution and meteorology data were retrieved from the 132 monitoring stations. All associations at study were investigated using a lag-distributed regression and adjusted to temperature and humidity.
Results
There were 12401 OHCA cases. Patients experiencing OHCA were likely to be exposed to elevated levels of pollutants, specifically, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter of size ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) several hours prior to an event, although both at borderline significance, i.e. odds ratio (OR) = 1.20 (95%CI 0.96; 1.51) and OR = 1.15 (95%CI 0.84; 1.60), respectively. An exposure to NO2 was independently associated with OHCA among males (OR = 1.39, 95%CI 0.96; 2.01) and if occurred during the midweek (OR = 1.43, 95%CI 1.03; 1.97). The adverse effect of PM10 was more evident during a weekend (OR = 2.36, 95%CI 0.88; 6.28), as opposed to working days (OR = 0.81, 95%CI 0.45; 1.44). Analysis stratified by regions suggested a spatial variability in pollution associated with OHCA.
Conclusions
Short-term exposure to high levels of pollution is adversely associated with OHCA independently of meteorological conditions. The magnitude of the effect is modified by patients' demography.
Main finding
Short-term exposure to high levels of pollution is adversely associated with OHCA. This effect is independent of temperature and humidity.},

Fewer hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), respiratory diseases (RD), and respiratory infections (RI) were also observed. However, increased per unit mass toxicity of the remaining PM2.5 was observed. In this study, the changes in hospitalizations and ED visits have been assessed by comparing the PM2.5 and source specific PM2.5 excess risk (ER) relationships between 2005-2007 and 2014–2016 yielded reductions of $\sim$27,000, 2600, and 4251 hospitalizations per year for CVD, RD, and RI, and charge savings of $\sim$613, 41, and 41 million dollars, respectively. However, period specific ER values estimated lower health and cost benefits. For some diseases, hospitalizations increased with increased healthcare costs. Using the whole-period source-specific PM2.5 ER values, the number of hospitalizations decreased by $\sim$13,500 and $\sim$19,000 for CVD and RD but increased by $\sim$800 for RI. Larger period specific ER values for RD shifted from net decreases to net increases in ED visits. Costs followed the numbers of hospitalizations and ED visits and produced increased charges of $\sim$284 million. County average costs for disease specific hospitalizations and ED visits were used with county specific ER values to estimate those costs. There were increased ED visit costs for some health outcomes. Thus, further action is required to address changes in composition as well as further reductions in concentrations will be needed to address changes in composition and to provide additional public health gains.},

Thus, this study was conducted to evaluate indoor/outdoor size-segregated particulate matter (PM) mass concentrations, followed by black carbon (rBC) and trace elements analysis and health risk assessment estimate in quasi-ultrafine particles (q-UFP), in a OL nursing home in S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil. The outdoor mass concentrations (32.0 $\mu$g/m³ for PM10 and 22.8 $\mu$g/m³ for PM2.5) were higher (p < 0.05) than those indoors (21.6 $\mu$g/m³for PM10 and 14.6 $\mu$g/m³for PM2.5), indicating the significant influence of outdoor sources reinforced by the strong correlation between indoor/outdoor, r2 = 0.84 and 0.79 for PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. The daily PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentrations indoors and outdoors exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines during different seasons. The elements S, K and Na were the most abundant in all campaigns, with sulfur the highest, reaching 740 and 722 ng/m³ outdoors and indoors, respectively. The Lifetime Carcinogenic Risk (LCR) values (2.2 × 10−5 and 4.6 × 10−5/1.9 × 10−5and 3.8 × 10−5) exceeded the threshold value of 1 × 10−6 under indoors and outdoors, on mean, for different scenarios (chronic and sub chronic). The particle deposition was found to be 32%, in the respiratory system, higher for elderly males than for females. Our study confirmed that both indoor and outdoor environments may be unsafe for the elderly health and the importance of reducing harmful air pollutants where populations have been living.},

abstract = {The health impact of changes in particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) pollution associated with the COVID-19 lockdown has aroused great interest, but the estimation of the long-term health effects is difficult because of the lack of an annual mean air pollutant concentration under a whole-year lockdown scenario. We employed a time series decomposition method to predict the monthly PM2.5 concentrations in urban cities under permanent lockdown in 2020. The premature mortality attributable to long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 was quantified by the risk factor model from the latest epidemiological studies. Under a whole-year lockdown scenario, annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in cites ranged from 5.4 to 68.0 $\mu$g m−3, and the national mean concentration was reduced by 32.2% compared to the 2015–2019 mean. The Global Exposure Mortality Model estimated that 837.3 (95% CI: 699.8–968.4) thousand people in Chinese cities would die prematurely from illnesses attributable to long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5. Compared to 2015–2019 mean levels, 140.2 (95% CI: 122.2–156.0) thousand premature deaths (14.4% of the annual mean deaths from 2015 to 2019) attributable to long-term exposure to PM2.5 were avoided. Because PM2.5 concentrations were still high under the whole-year lockdown scenario, the health benefit is limited, indicating that continuous emission-cutting efforts are required to reduce the health risks of air pollution. Since a similar scenario may be achieved through promotion of electric vehicles and the innovation of industrial technology in the future, the estimated long-term health impact under the whole year lockdown scenario can establish an emission–air quality–health impact linkage and provide guidance for future emission control strategies from a health protection perspective.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic contamination of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in riverbed sediments of the Pampean area (Matanza-Riachuelo Basin, MRB), Argentina, was evaluated using various indices: Geo-accumulation Index (Igeo), Contamination Factor (Cf), Metal Pollution Index (MPI), Pollution Load Index (PLI) and Contamination Degree (Cdeg). A database based on previous samplings of heavy metal concentrations at different sites in the Upper, Middle and Lower MRB was used. The Igeo and Cf values are calculated using selected local background (Pristine Pampean loess, LZB), and global average shale values (ASTW). Paired Igeo and Cf results with LZB and ASTW fall in dissimilar classes, especially in respect of Cd. In turn, MPI, PLI and Cdeg show similar results, as they do not have the same degree of confidence as Igeo and Cf. The Upper Basin, mainly rural, shows the following profile of sediment contamination: Cd > Ni > Cu ≫ Pb > Zn > Cr. The Middle Basin, which is at the periphery of a very industrialised and urban area, displays the following contamination profile for both Igeo and Cf: Cu > Pb > Zn > Ni > Cd > Cr. Conversely, in the Lower Basin, where land-use is urban/industrial, the levels of metal contamination are higher and appear in this order: Cr > Pb > Cu > Zn > Ni > Cd. Cadmium, Cu, Ni and Zn have shown no significant oral and/or dermal HQ nor carcinogenic risk but the potential risk posed by Cr and Pb must be taken into account. Maximum and mean values of Cr total carcinogenic risk (TCR) as well as Ni TCR also point to a health risk to children in the Lower Basin Area. All the data analysed confirm that industrial and urban growth without land-use planning, and a poor environmental legislation until the beginning of the 21st century, have not provided the necessary framework for sustainable development in the MRB.},

abstract = {Maternal exposure to air pollution has been associated with a higher birth defect (BD) risk. Previous studies suffer from inaccurate exposure assessment methods, confounding individual-level variations, and classical analytical modelling. This study aimed to examine the association between maternal exposure to criteria air pollutants and BD risk. A total of 553 cases and 10,214 controls were identified from private and public databases. Two subgroups were then formed: one for a matched case-control design, and another for Feature Selection (FS) analysis. Exposure assessment was based on the mean air pollutant-specific levels in the mother's residential area during the specific BD gestational time window of risk (GTWR) and other time intervals. Multivariate regression models outcomes consistently showed a significant protective effect for folic acid intake and highlighted parental consanguinity as a strong BD risk factor. After adjusting for these putative risk factors and other covariates, results show that maternal exposure to PM2.5 during the first trimester is significantly associated with a higher overall BD risk (OR:1.05, 95%CI:1.01–1.09), and with a higher risk of genitourinary defects (GUD) (OR:1.06, 95%CI:1.01–1.11) and neural tube defects (NTD) (OR:1.10, 95%CI:1.03–1.17) during specific GTWRs. Maternal exposure to NO2 during GTWR exhibited a significant protective effect for NTD (OR:0.94, 95%CI:0.90–0.99), while all other examined associations were not statistically significant. Additionally, maternal exposure to SO2 during GTWR showed a significant association with a higher GUD risk (OR:1.17, 95%CI:1.08–1.26). When limiting selection to designated monitor coverage radiuses, PM2.5 maintained significance with BD risk and showed a significant gene-environment interaction for GUD (p = 0.018), while NO2 protective effect expanded to other subtypes. On the other hand, FS analysis confirmed maternal exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 as important features for GUD, CHD, and NTD. Our findings, set the basis for building a novel BD risk prediction model.},

Physiologically correct 3-D models for generations 10–12 of the human airways are applied to carry out a numerical analysis of two-phase flow for full breathing cycles. Two concentrations of PM2.5 are applied for the simulation, i.e., 30 $\mu$g⋅m−3 and 80 $\mu$g⋅m−3 for three breathing statuses, i.e., rest, light exercise, and moderate activity. All the PM2.5 injected into the control volume is assumed to be 100% contaminated with the SAR-CoV-2 virus. Skewed air-flow phenomena at the bifurcations are proportional to the Reynolds number at the inlet, and their intensity in the asthmatic airway exceeded that of the healthy one. Upon exhalation, two peak air-flow vectors from daughter branches combine to form one big vector in the parent generation. Asthmatic airway models has higher deposition efficiencies (DEs) for contaminated PM2.5 as compared to the healthy one. Higher DEs arise in the asthmatic airway model due to complex secondary flows which increase the impaction of contaminated PM2.5 on airways' walls.},

PM2.5 personal environmental monitoring samplers were used to collect both indoor and outdoor PM2.5 in urban and rural areas in Taiwan. Al, Cd, Cr, Mn, Pb, V, and Zn were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Source apportionment of metals in PM2.5 was carried out with factor analysis (FA). Health risk assessment of metals was performed on children via inhalation. The average indoor PM2.5 concentrations were 11.9 ± 5.2 $\mu$g/m3 and 11.9 ± 4.7 $\mu$g/m3 in urban and rural areas, respectively. The most predominant metal indoors in urban areas was Al, followed by Zn, Pb, Mn, V, Cr, and Cd, with a similar result in rural areas. The results from FA indicated that traffic emission and oil combustion in the outside environment were major pollution sources to indoor Mn, V, and Zn; corrosion of building material could be a contributor to Al, Cd, and Pb; pollution sources were different to Cr in two areas. The carcinogenic risk for indoor Cr(VI) via inhalation was higher in urban areas (boy: 6.61E-06; girl: 6.18E-06) than that in rural areas (boy: 2.80E-06; girl: 2.62E-06). These findings will help us to further understand the pollution sources, health risks, and control strategies for metals in PM2.5 in children's bedrooms for reducing adverse health effects, including in rural areas.},

Based on the ground-measured data and MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2) reanalysis data, BC's pollution characteristics and the health risks caused by BC exposure were investigated in Tianjin, China. The results showed that the highest BC concentration occurred in winter, and the annual average concentration of BC on weekends was higher than that on weekdays in winter. The hourly average monitoring concentration variations of BC in four seasons all had two peaks that appeared 6:00–8:00 and 22:00–2:00. For MERRA-2 reanalysis data, there was one peak appeared during 5:00–7:00 in four seasons. The lowest values appeared during 14:00–16:00 for both ground-measured data and MERRA-2. The relationships between BC concentration and meteorological factors showed that wind speed and temperature inversion played important roles in the atmospheric BC diffusion. The wind directions of southwest, southeast, and north were closely associated with BC in 2019. The Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) results showed that the southwestern area of Tianjin, especially the southern Hebei, northern Henan and Beijing, would be the potential source areas of Tianjin BC in 2019. The cancer risks of adults and children caused by BC exposure in Tianjin were higher than the risk levels (1 × 10−6 to 1 × 10−4) recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) in 2019, resulting in more than 3.78 cases of cancer per 10,000 adults (3.78 × 10−4), and more than 1.55 cases of cancer per 10,000 children (1.55 × 10−4), respectively. The relative risk (RR) of BC exposure on mortality showed the highest in winter and the lowest in summer. Compared with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respiratory mortality caused by the BC showed the highest risk.},

For six weeks from February 9, 2014, smoke and ash from a fire in the Morwell open cut brown coal mine adjacent to the Hazelwood power station covered parts of the Latrobe Valley, in south eastern Australia.
Aims
To evaluate the health impact of the mine fire, daily counts of ambulance attendances from July 2010 to March 2015 were analysed.
Methods
Time series models were used to evaluate the relative risk of ambulance attendances during the mine fire, in comparison with the remainder of the analysis period, and to also assess the risk of ambulance attendances associated with lagged effects of exposure to mine fire-related PM2.5 levels. The models controlled for factors likely to influence ambulance attendances including seasonality, long-term temporal trends, day of the week, daily maximum temperature and public holidays.
Results
A 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in fire-related PM2.5 was found to be associated with a 42% (95%CI: 14–76%) increase in ambulance attendances for respiratory conditions and a 7% (0–14%) increase in all ambulance attendances over a 20-day lag period. A smaller effect associated with exposure to fire-related PM2.5 was identified when assuming shorter lag effects. Similar results were identified when assessing whether ambulance attendances increased during the 30-day mine fire period. There was a 15% (8–21%) increased risk of ambulance attendances for all conditions and a 47% (19–81%) increased risk for respiratory conditions during the mine fire period.
Conclusions
Exposure to smoke and ash from a fire in an open cut brown coal mine was associated with increased ambulance attendances, particularly for respiratory conditions. These findings guide the development and implementation of effective and timely strategies and health service planning to respond and mitigate health risks that arise in affected communities during future major air pollution episodes.},

abstract = {The skin is an essential barrier, protecting the body against the environment and its numerous pollutants. Several environmental pollutants are known to affect the skin, inducing premature aging through mechanisms including oxidative stress, inflammation, and impairment of skin functions. Even climate conditions can impact the skin. Therefore, using a Reconstructed Human Epidermis (RHE), we tested the effect of two samples of fine particulate matters (PM0.3-2.5 – one metals-rich sample and the other organic compounds-rich), two Volatile Organic Compounds mixtures (VOCs – from a solvent-based paint and a water-based paint) and Tobacco Smoke (TS). All pollutants affected cellular functionality, but to a lesser extent for the water-based paint VOC. This effect was enhanced when RHE were preconditioned for 2 h by a semi-dry airflow (45% relative humidity) before pollutants application, compared to preconditioning by a humid airflow (90% relative humidity). In the absence of preconditioning, IL-1$\alpha$, IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES were almost systematically induced by pollutants. When RHE were preconditioned by a semi-dry or humid airflow before being subjected to pollutants, the increase of IL-1$\alpha$, IL-8, and RANTES falls into two groups. Similarly to RHE not treated with pollutants, RHE treated with VOCs after preconditioning by a semi-dry airflow showed increased IL-1$\alpha$, IL-8, and RANTES release. On the contrary, RHE treated with PM or TS after preconditioning by a semi-dry airflow show a lower increase in IL-1$\alpha$, IL-8, and RANTES compared to preconditioning by a humid airflow. The effect of real environmental relative humidity conditions of the air, combined with acute exposure to various environmental pollutants, seemed to relate mainly to structural changes of the skin, determining the outcome of the inflammatory response depending on the physicochemical characteristics of pollutants.},

abstract = {Ambient air pollution is the leading cause of environmental mortality and morbidity worldwide. However, the individual contributions to acute mortality of traffic-related air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are still debated. We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study for a population located around Zurich airport in Switzerland, including 24,886 adult cardiovascular deaths from the Swiss National Cohort. We estimated the risk of cause-specific cardiovascular mortality associated with daily NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations at home using distributed lag models up to 7 days preceding death, adjusted for daily temperature, precipitation, acute night-time aircraft noise, firework celebrations, and holidays. Cardiovascular mortality was associated with NO2, whereas the association with PM2.5 disappeared upon adjustment for NO2. The strongest association was observed between NO2 and ischemic stroke mortality (odds ratio = 1.55 per 10 $\mu$g/m3, 95% confidence intervals = 1.20–2.00). Cause-specific mortality analyses showed differences in terms of delayed effect: odds ratios were highest at 1–3 days after exposure for most outcomes but at lags of 3–5 days for heart failure. Individual vulnerabilities to NO2 associated cardiovascular mortality also varied by cause of death, possibly highlighting the role of different behaviours and risk factors in the most susceptible groups. The risk of cardiovascular mortality was also increased on firework days and after public holidays, independent from NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations. This study confirms the association between ambient NO2, as a marker for primary emissions, and acute cardiovascular mortality in a specific setting around a major airport. Future research should clarify the role of additional air pollutants including ultra-fine particles on cardiovascular diseases to inform most efficient control measures.},

The major sources of the particulate matter were analyzed using the chemical mass balance model. We found that the main emission sources were coal combustion during the heating period and open sources during the non-heating period. The ILCR was initially calculated as 2.65 × 10−9 for coal-producing cities and 4.60 × 10−9 for the oil-producing city during the heating period and 1.17 × 10−8 and 3.34 × 10−8, respectively, during the non-heating period. When only the bioaccessible fraction was used, the ILCR in coal-producing cities and the oil-producing city decreased by 87.2% and 82.1%, respectively, for the heating period and by 89.0% and 80.1%, respectively, for the non-heating period. The findings suggest that bioaccessibility should be considered when assessing the carcinogenic risk of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

abstract = {The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic forced most countries to put in place lockdown measures to slow down the transmission of the virus. These lockdowns have led to temporal improvements in air quality. Here, we evaluate the changes in NO2 and O3 levels along with the associated impact upon premature mortality during the COVID-19 lockdown and deconfinement periods along the first epidemic wave across the provincial capital cities of Spain. We first quantify the change in pollutants solely due to the lockdown as the difference between business-as-usual (BAU) pollution levels, estimated with a machine learning-based meteorological normalization technique, and observed concentrations. Second, instead of using exposure-response functions between the pollutants and mortality reported in the literature, we fit conditional quasi-Poisson regression models to estimate city-specific associations between daily pollutant levels and non-accidental mortality during the period 2010–2018. Significant relative risk values are observed at lag 1 for NO2 (1.0047 [95% CI: 1.0014 to 1.0081]) and at lag 0 for O3 (1.0039 [1.0013 to 1.0065]). On average NO2 changed by −51% (intercity range −65.7 to −30.9%) and −36.4% (−53.7 to −11.6%), and O3 by −1.1% (−20.2 to 23.8%) and 0.6% (−12.4 to 23.0%), during the lockdown (57 days) and deconfinement (42 days) periods, respectively. We obtain a reduction in attributable mortality associated with NO2 changes of −119 (95% CI: -273 to −24) deaths over the lockdown, and of −53 (−114 to −10) deaths over the deconfinement. This was partially compensated by an increase in the attributable number of deaths, 14 (−72 to 99) during the lockdown, and 8 (−27 to 50) during the deconfinement, associated with the rise in O3 levels in the most populous cities during the analysed period, despite the overall small average reductions. Our study shows that the potential trade-offs between multiple air pollutants should be taken into account when evaluating the health impacts of environmental exposures.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to fine particulate matter and black carbon is related to cognitive impairment and poor lung function, but less is known about the routes taken by different types of air pollutants to affect cognition.
Objectives
We tested two possible routes of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC) in impairing cognition, and evaluated their importance: a direct route over the olfactory nerve or the blood stream, and an indirect route over the lung.
Methods
We used longitudinal observational data for 49,705 people aged 18+ from 2006 to 2015 from the Dutch Lifelines cohort study. By linking current home addresses to air pollution exposure data from ELAPSE in 2010, long-term average exposure to PM2.5 and BC was assessed. Lung function was measured by spirometry and Global Initiative (GLI) z-scores of forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were calculated. Cognitive performance was measured by cognitive processing time (CPT) assessed by the Cogstate Brief Battery. Linear structural equation modeling was performed to test direct/indirect associations.
Results
Higher exposure to PM2.5 but not BC was related to higher CPT and slower cognitive processing speed [Total Effect PM2.5: FEV1 model = 8.31 × 10−3 (95% CI: 5.71 × 10−3, 10.91 × 10−3), FVC model = 8.30 × 10−3 (95% CI: 5.69 × 10−3, 10.90 × 10−3)]. The direct association of PM2.5 constituted more than 97% of the total effect. Mediation by lung function was low for PM2.5 with a mediated proportion of 1.32% (FEV1) and 2.05% (FVC), but higher for BC (7.01% and 13.82% respectively).
Discussion
Our results emphasise the importance of the lung acting as a mediator in the relationship between both exposure to PM2.5 and BC, and cognitive performance. However, higher exposure to PM2.5 was mainly directly associated with worse cognitive performance, which emphasises the health-relevance of fine particles due to their ability to reach vital organs directly.},

So far, limited studies have linked between emission sources and health risks from ambient field measurements. In this work, PM2.5 samples were collected in Beijing in the 2018 winter; 23 metallic elements were determined to assess the health risks induced by PM-bound metals. During the sampling period, metallic elements constituted a minor fraction (5%) in PM2.5, but exhibited significant threats to human health. The cancer risk (CR) value induced by PM-bound metals was 1.41 × 10−4 for adults and 2.59 × 10−4 for children while non-cancer risk (NCR) was 2.59 for adults and 3.37 for children. Nickel (Ni), As and Cr(IV) were the major contributing elements to carcinogenic risk. Arsenic (As) contributed a major (57%) of NCR for children, and Mn (30%), Ni (27%) and As (24%) were the major contributing species to NCR for adults. Using positive matrix factorization (PMF) model, traffic-related emission (25% for children and 30% for adults) and heavy oil combustion (39% for children and 28% for adults) were the dominant sources of CR values. Moreover, the CR value induced by local emissions was higher than that by long-range transported air pollution. Local traffic emission and long-range transported heavy oil combustion enhanced CR values, threatening the human health. As results, we highlighted that control of traffic emissions and heavy oil combustion on local and regional scales should be seriously considered by the Chinese government in reduction of health risk in Beijing.},

abstract = {Air quality has been significantly improved in China in recent years; however, our knowledge of the long-term changes in health risks from exposure to air pollutants remain less understood. Here we investigated the temporal variations and spatial distributions of six criteria pollutants (SO2, NO2, O3, CO, PM2.5 and PM10) in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) during 2015–2019. SO2 showed 36−60% reductions in three regions, comparatively, NO2 decreased by 3–17% in BTH and YRD and had a 5% increase in PRD. PM2.5 and PM10 showed the largest reductions in BTH (30−33%) and the lowest in PRD (7−13%), while O3 increased by 9% during 2015–2019 particularly in BTH and YRD. Assuming that only air pollutants above given thresholds exert excess risk (ERtotal) of mortality, we found that the different variations of pollutants have caused ERtotal in BTH decreasing significantly from 4.8% in 2015 to 2.0% in 2019, while from 1.9% to 1.0% in YRD, and a small change in PRD. These results indicate substantially decreased health risks of mortality from exposure to air pollutants as a response to improved air quality. Overall, PM2.5 dominated ERtotal accounting for 42−53% in BTH and 58−64% in YRD with steadily increased contributions, yet ERtotal presented strong seasonal dependence on air pollutants with largely increased contribution of O3 in summer. The ERtotal caused by SO2 was decreased substantially and became negligible except in winter in BTH, while NO2 only played a role in winter. We also found that ERPM2.5 was compositional dependent with organics being the major contributor at low ERPM2.5 while nitrate was more important at high ERPM2.5. Our results highlight that evaluation of public health risks of air pollution needs to consider chemical differences of PM in different regions in addition to dominant air pollutants in different seasons.},

However, whether vascular changes in children is related to exposure to air pollutants remains unknown. This study examined whether childhood exposure to air pollutants was related to a marker of cardiovascular risk, carotid intima–media thickness (CIMT) in children aged 11–12 years old. Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) recruited parents and their children born in 2003–4. Among the participants, CheckPoint examination was conducted when the children were 11–12 years old. Ultrasound of the right carotid artery was performed using standardized protocols. Average and maximum far-wall CIMT, carotid artery distensibility, and elasticity were quantified using semiautomated software. Annual and life-time exposure to air pollutants was estimated using satellite-based land-use regression by residential postcodes. A total of 1063 children (50.4% girls) with CIMT data, serum cholesterol, and modeled estimates of NO2 and PM2.5 exposure for the period 2003 to 2015 were included. The average and maximum CIMT, carotid distensibility, and elasticity were 497 $\mu$m (standard deviation, SD 58), 580 $\mu$m (SD 44), 17.4% (SD 3.2), and 0.48%/mmHg (SD 0.09), respectively. The life-time average concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 were 6.4 $\mu$g/m3 (SD 1.4) and 6.4 ppb (SD 2.4), respectively. Both average and maximum CIMT were significantly associated with average ambient PM2.5 concentration (average CIMT: +5.5 $\mu$m per $\mu$g/m3, 95% confidence interval, CI 2.4 to 8.5, and maximum CIMT: +4.9 $\mu$m per $\mu$g/m3, CI 2.3 to 7.6), estimated using linear regression, adjusting for potential confounders. CIMT was not significantly related to NO2 exposure. Carotid artery diameter, distensibility, and elasticity were not significantly associated with air pollutants. We conclude that life-time exposure to low levels of PM2.5 in children might have measurable adverse impacts on vascular structure by age 11–12 years.},

We collected weekly 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and serum biomarkers from each participant five times over 35 days. The fixed point, real-time, mass concentrations of particles with aerodynamic diameters of ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), PM1, PM0.5, and number concentrations of particles with aerodynamic diameters of ≤0.2 $\mu$m (PNC0.2), PNC0.1, and PNC0.03 were monitored in the catchment area, and linear mixed-effect models were used to estimate the associations between the size-fractioned PM exposure and ECG indices. The results showed that there was a significant association between higher size-fractioned PM levels and higher RV5+SV1 voltage within 24 h of exposure. We detected increases in the RV5+SV1 voltage of 0.060, 0.058, 0.090, 0.084, and 0.077 mV per interquartile range (IQR) PM2.5 (45.92 $\mu$g/m3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.003, 0.117), PM1 (43.51 $\mu$g/m3; 95% CI = 0.003, 0.113), PNC0.2 (14.92 × 103 particles/cm3; 95% CI = 0.017, 0.163), PNC0.1 (12.79 × 103 particles/cm3; 95% CI = 0.004, 0.163), and PNC0.03 (5.43 × 103 particles/cm3; 95% CI = 0, 0.153), respectively. The associations between the RV5+SV1 voltage and size-fractioned PM exposure were stronger among participants with greater serum concentrations of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, soluble CD40 ligand, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and total cholesterol, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Exposure to various PM size fractions (PNC0.03-PNC0.2, and PM0.5-PM2.5) may increase the left ventricular voltage among healthy young adults, and the effects may be modified by inflammation, coagulation, and lipid biomarkers.},

Recent studies have reported that DNAm of imprinted control regions (ICRs) in imprinted genes may be a sensitive biomarker of environmental exposure. Less is known about specific biomarkers of imprinted genes after PM2.5 exposure. The relationship between PM2.5 and its chemical constituents and DNAm of ICRs in imprinted genes after short-term exposure was investigated to determine specific human biomarkers of its adverse health effects. A panel study was carried out in healthy young people in Guangzhou, China. Mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the influence of PM2.5 and its constituent exposure on DNAm while controlling for potential confounders. There was no significant correlation between DNAm and personal PM2.5 exposure mass. DNAm changes in eight ICRs (L3MBTL1, NNAT, PEG10, GNAS Ex1A, MCTS2, SNURF/SNRPN, IGF2R, and RB1) and a non-imprinted gene (CYP1B1) were significantly associated with PM2.5 constituents. Compared to non-imprinted genes, imprinted gene methylation was more susceptible to interference with PM2.5 constituent exposure. Among those genes, L3MBTL1 was the most sensitive to personal PM2.5 constituent exposure. Moreover, transition metals derived from traffic sources (Cd, Fe, Mn, and Ni) significantly influenced DNAm of the imprinted genes, suggesting the importance of more targeted measures to reduce toxic constituents. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that imprinted genes (RB1) may be correlated with pathways and diseases (non-small cell lung cancer, glioma, and bladder cancer). The present study suggests that screening the imprinted gene for DNAm can be used as a sensitive biomarker of PM2.5 exposure. The results will provide data for prevention of PM2.5 exposure and a novel perspective on potential mechanisms on an epigenetic level.},

abstract = {Poor air quality is an emerging problem in Australia primarily due to ozone pollution events and lengthening and more severe wildfire seasons. A significant deterioration in air quality was experienced in Australia's most populous cities, Melbourne and Sydney, as a result of fires during the so-called Black Summer which ran from November 2019 through to February 2020. Following this period, social, mobility and economic restrictions to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic were implemented in Australia. We quantify the air quality impact of these contrasting periods in the south-eastern states of Victoria and New South Wales (NSW) using a meteorological normalisation approach. A Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm was used to compute baseline time series' of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide CO and particulate matter with diameter < 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), based on a 19 year, detrended training dataset. Across Victorian sites, large increases in CO (188%), PM2.5 (322%) and ozone (22%) were observed over the RF prediction in January 2020. In NSW, smaller pollutant increases above the RF prediction were seen (CO 58%, PM2.5 80%, ozone 19%). This can be partly explained by the RF predictions being high compared to the mean of previous months, due to high temperatures and strong wind speeds, highlighting the importance of meteorological normalisation in attributing pollution changes to specific events. From the daily observation-RF prediction differences we estimated 249.8 (95% CI: 156.6–343.) excess deaths and 3490.0 (95% CI 1325.9–5653.5) additional hospitalisations were likely as a result of PM2.5 and O3 exposure in Victoria and NSW. During April 2019, when COVID-19 restrictions were in place, on average NO2 decreased by 21.5 and 8% in Victoria and NSW respectively. O3 and PM2.5 remained effectively unchanged in Victoria on average but increased by 20 and 24% in NSW respectively, supporting the suggestion that community mobility reduced more in Victoria than NSW. Overall the air quality change during the COVID-19 lockdown had a negligible impact on the calculated health outcomes.},

We have selected top five cities of India out of the 20 most polluted cities across the world including Ghaziabad, Delhi, Noida, Greater Noida, and Lucknow (LKO). Historical data of atmospheric PM10 and PM2.5 for all cities were obtained from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) online web portal of air quality data, except LKO. However, atmospheric PMs was monitored in LKO and samples of PM10 and PM2.5 were collected. During the LD and Post-LD period, due to anthropogenic emissions switch-off' a sharp decline was observed in concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 in both circumstances (monthly and mean variation) as compared to Pre-LD in all selected cities. The Percentage changes (PCs) was found in mean concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 during LD** and Post-LD*** with respect to Pre-LD at selected cities; Delhi −40.78%**, −58.42%*** and −57.60%**, −70.11%***; Ghaziabad −31.20%**, −53.91%*** and −57.29%**, −44.82%***; Noida −36.59&**, −53.95&*** and −58.36%**, −68.49%***; Greater Noida −39.39%**, −55.75%*** and −61.07%**, −71.56%***; LKO -57.95%**, −65.01%*** and −63.31%**, −59.95%*** respectively. The PCs of both pollutants exhibited a significant decrease in mean concentrations in all selected cities during LD and Post-LD with respect to Pre-LD period. Consequently, the results of current studies suggest that due to COVID-19 pandemic national LD restriction on anthropogenic activities, both coarse and fine pollutants have significantly reduced and air quality greatly improved during LD and Post-LD as compared to pre-LD period in all selected cities of India.},

abstract = {Background
Scarce evidence is available on the health effects of various chemical constituents of PM2.5 on hospital visits in China.
Objectives
To examine the short-term associations between a wide range of PM2.5 constituents and hospital outpatient and emergency room visits in Shanghai.
Methods
We obtained daily concentrations of PM2.5 total mass, organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), eight water-soluble ions and thirteen elemental constituents between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015. We analyzed the data using over dispersed generalized additive models with Poisson regression. Single-constituent, PM2.5-adjusted and constituent-residual models were built respectively to assess the associations. Exposure-response curves for the PM2.5 constituents with robust effects were graphed.
Results
The average daily mean PM2.5 concentration was 63.3 $\mu$g/m3 in Shanghai during the study period. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 2.57% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.28%, 3.87%) increase in outpatient visits, and a 3.60% (95% CI: 2.16%, 5.03%) increase in emergency room visits. We observed robust and positive associations between Mg2+, Ca2+, six elemental components (Ca, Mn, Fe, Zn, Ga and Se) and outpatient visits. OC, EC, Cl−, Mg2+, Ca2+ and ten elemental components (Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Zn, Ga, As, Se, Pb, and Ni) were significantly and positively associated with emergency room visits. The exposure-response relationships were positive and generally linear for the above constituents.
Conclusions
This time-series study in Shanghai demonstrated significant associations between various carbonaceous, water-soluble and elemental constituents of PM2.5 and hospital visits, providing evidence for source-specific control of particulate air pollution.},

The exposure increased oocyte degeneration rate (21.5% vs 5.1%, respectively (P＜0.01) and decreased the 2-cell formation rate (71.9% vs 86.0%, P < 0.01). Transcriptome profiling using RNA sequencing showed wide spectrum of abnormal expression of genes, particularly those involved in regulating the mitochondrial respiratory complex in oocytes and metabolic processes in blastocysts. The exposure decreased litter size (6 ± 0.37 vs 7 ± 0.26, P＜0.05) and weight (1.18 ± 0.02 vs 1.27 ± 0.02 g, P＜0.01). In summary, PM2.5 exposure decreased female fertility, possibly through increased ROS production in oocytes and metabolic disturbances in developing embryos. The cause-effect relationship, however, requires further investigation.},

However, few studies have investigated the toxicological eﬀects of source-specific PM2.5 at the individual level. To investigate the potential impact of source-specific PM2.5 on cytotoxic effects, we performed repeated personal PM2.5 monitoring of 48 adult participants in Hong Kong during the winter and summer of 2014–2015. Quartz filters were analyzed for carbonaceous aerosols and water-soluble ions in PM2.5. Teflon filters were collected to determine personal PM2.5 mass and metal concentrations. The toxicological effects of personal PM2.5 exposure—including cytotoxicity, inflammatory response, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production—were measured using A549 cells in vitro. Personal PM2.5 samples collected in winter were more effective than those collected in summer at inducing cytotoxicity and the expression of proinflammation cytokine IL-6. By contrast, summer personal PM2.5 samples induced high ROS production. We performed a series of statistical analyses, Spearman correlation and a source apportionment approach with a multiple linear regression (MLR) model, to explore the sources contributing most significantly to personal PM2.5 bioreactivity. Secondary inorganic species and transition metals were discovered to be weak-to-moderately associated with cytotoxicity (rs: 0.26–0.55; p < 0.01) and inflammatory response (rs: 0.26–0.44; p < 0.05), respectively. Carbonaceous aerosols (i.e., organic and elemental carbon; rs: 0.23–0.27; p < 0.05) and crustal material (Mg and Ca) was positively associated with ROS generation. The PMF–MLR models revealed that tailpipe exhaust and secondary sulfate contributed to ROS generation, whereas secondary nitrate was the major contributor to PM2.5 cytotoxicity and inflammation. These results improve and variate the arguments for practical policies designed to mitigate the risks posed by air pollution sources and to protect public health.},

abstract = {Aims/hypothesis
Worldwide, the information regarding the associations between long-term exposure to ozone (O3) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) and the development of type 2 diabetes remains scarce, especially in Asia. This study aimed to investigate the long-term effects of exposure to ambient O3 and SO2 on the incidence of type 2 diabetes with consideration of other air pollutants in Taiwanese adults aged 30 to 50 years.
Methods
A total of 6,426,802 non-diabetic participants aged between 30 and 50 years old were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database between 2005 and 2016. Incident type 2 diabetes was the main diagnosis at medical visits. Air quality data were provided by the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration. The air pollutant concentrations for each participant were estimated using the ordinary kriging method to interpolate daily concentrations of O3, SO2, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), suspended fine particles (with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 $\mu$m; PM2.5), and suspended particles (with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 $\mu$m; PM10) in residential districts across Taiwan. Six-year average concentrations of pollutants were calculated from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2010, and data were categorized into quartiles. We performed Cox regression models to analyze the long-term effects of exposure to O3 and SO2 on the incidence of type 2 diabetes.
Results
The hazard ratio (HR) for the incidence of diabetes per each interquartile range (IQR) increase in ozone exposure (3.30 ppb) was 1.058 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.053, 1.064) and 1.011 (95% CI: 1.007, 1.015) for SO2 exposure (1.77 ppb) after adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, urbanization level, temperature, humidity, and chronic comorbidities (Model 3). Furthermore, for every 3.30 ppb increase of O3, the HR for incident type 2 diabetes was 1.093 (95% CI: 1.087, 1.100) after controlling factors shown in Model 3 plus SO2 and PM2.5. On the other hand, for every 1.77 ppb increase of SO2, the HR for incident type 2 diabetes was 1.073 (95% CI: 1.068, 1.079) after controlling factors shown in Model 3 plus NO2 and PM2.5.
Conclusions
Long-term exposure to ambient O3 and SO2 was associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes for Taiwanese population. Exposure to O3 and SO2 may play a role in the adult early-onset type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to fine particulate matter (<2.5 mm in aerodynamic diameter, PM2.5) pollution, even at low concentrations is associated with increased mortality. Estimates of the magnitude of the effect of particulate air pollution on mortality are generally done on a coarse spatial scale, such as 0.5°, and may fail to capture small spatial differences in exposure and baseline rates, which can bias results and impede the ability to consider environmental justice. We estimated the burden of mortality attributable to long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 among adults in the Continental United States on a 1 km scale, in order to provide information for decision makers setting health priorities.
Methods
We conducted a health impact assessment for 2015 using a model predicting U.S. PM2.5 concentrations at a spatial resolution of 1 km cells. We applied a concentration-response curve from a recently published meta-analysis of long-term PM2.5 mortality association which incorporates new findings at high and low PM2.5 concentrations. We computed the change in deaths in each grid cell, based on its grid cell population, Zip code level baseline mortality rates, and exposure under two scenarios; a decrease of PM2.5 exposure levels by 40% and a decrease of PM2.5 exposure levels to the county minimum PM2.5 concentrations.
Results
We estimated the deaths would fall by 104,786 (95% CI 57,016–135,726) and 112,040 (95% CI 63,261-159,116) attributable to 40% reduction and reduction to the county minimum PM2.5 concentrations, respectively. The greatest mortality impact due to 40% reduction in PM2.5 was observed in California with; 11,621 (95% CI; 7156-15,989) and Texas with; 9616 (95% CI; 5798–13,352) excess deaths attributable to annual mean PM2.5 concentrations of 9.54 and 9.12 $\mu$g m−3, respectively. Within city analyses showed substantial heterogeneity in risk. The estimated Attributable fraction (AF %) in locations with high PM2.5 levels was 8.6% (95% CI 5.4–11.7) compared to the overall AF% of 4.9% (95% CI; 2.9–6.8). In comparison, results using county average PM2.5 were smaller than the estimates from the 1 km PM2.5 datasets. Similarly, estimates using county-level mortality rates were smaller than estimates based on Zip-code level mortality rates.
Conclusions
Our study provides evidence of major health benefits expected from reducing PM2.5 exposure, even in regions with relatively low PM2.5 concentrations. Spatial characteristics of exposure and baseline mortality (e.g., accuracy, scales, and variations) in disease burden studies can significantly impact the results.},

abstract = {A growing number of epidemiological studies have been affirming the linking between fine particles (PM2.5) and deaths due to diverse causes as a result of long-term exposure. This work demonstrates the benefits of improving air quality policies by evaluating the impact of PM2.5 in terms of avoidable mortality due to all causes, cardiopulmonary causes, and lung cancer, between 2014 and 2018, for 5570 Brazilian cities. Satellite annual surface PM2.5 concentrations were compared with available monitoring measurements and used as the baseline scenario. Each phase of the Brazilian air quality legislation (CONAMA 491/2018) was used as a control scenario. The satellite PM2.5 annual surface levels were slightly lower than the monitoring concentrations, with an average mean bias of −2.7 $\mu$g/m3. No annual mean PM2.5 concentration above 20 $\mu$g/m3 was observed in any city in 2014 and 2018. In 2016, 23% of cities exceeded the annual mean concentration of 10 $\mu$g/m3. A weak positive correlation was found between city-level PM2.5 and population, vehicle fleet, number of fire outbreaks, urban area size, Growth Domestic Product per capita, Human Development Index, and life expectancy. During the five years, a total of 48,700 ± 7570 deaths due to all causes, 24,100 ± 3260 due to cardiopulmonary causes, and 1780 ± 435 due to lung cancer could be avoided if the maximum PM2.5 annual concentration of 10 $\mu$g/m3 was not exceeded. Less restrictive standards lead to much lower avoidable deaths. For example, considering the maximum annual concentration of 20 $\mu$g/m3, 1335 ± 175 deaths due to all causes could be avoided between 2015 and 2017. Our results indicate the importance of adopting more restrictive air quality standards in Brazil. If the current levels do not protect life as they should be, an effort regarding control emissions, monitoring, and modeling is essential to construct an effective air quality management for the country, aiming to comprehend the current PM2.5 concentration and to achieve lower standards.},

Hence, this study measured some biochemistry factors of 200 neonates with birth dates from January 19 to October 12, 2020, including the birth weight and height and the serum levels of ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, and TSH. The Support Vector Machine-fitted land-use regression approach was used to predict the spatio-temporal variability of intra-urban PM 2.5 and CO concentrations by month during the pregnancy period of the cases employing 5 variables of Digital Elevation Model (DEM), slope, and distance from Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) stations, Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) stations, and mines and industries. Spearman correlation analysis (p < 0.05) was performed between the neonate indices and mean monthly PM 2.5 and CO concentrations at the exact residential address of maternal cases and their nearby areas in 250, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 m-radius buffer rings. All modeling efforts succeeded in predicting CO and PM 2.5 levels with acceptable adjusted r2 values. Northern Isfahan had relatively higher CO and PM 2.5 concentrations due to its adjacency to low-vegetated open lands and its high traffic load as compared to southern areas. The correlation results between the neonate biochemistry indices and mean PM 2.5 and CO concentrations were mostly positive in most buffer rings, especially in the >500 m-radius buffer rings for PM 2.5 and in the 2000 m-radius rings for CO. Although the correlation results of PM 2.5 followed a detectable trend in the buffer rings, the associations between CO and the neonate biochemistry indices differed significantly between the buffer rings. Results showed that increasing mean monthly concentration of CO and PM 2.5 may stimulate further production of liver enzymes while decreasing the birth weight and height.},

abstract = {Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the largest environmental health risk in India. All previous studies in India focused on PM10 exposure for acute impact assessment; even the single study examining the PM2.5 acute exposure impact used data from a single site. Here we estimated the impact of acute PM2.5 exposure on non-trauma all-cause mortality in the megacity Delhi using a quasi-Poisson regression model and satellite-derived high-resolution (1-km) exposure data. Our satellite-PM2.5 dataset was calibrated and validated against coincident measurements from ground-based reference-grade monitors. This allowed us to minimize exposure misclassification, which otherwise would have happened due to reliance on limited ground-based monitoring sites with a large spatial gap. The annual average (median) PM2.5 exposure (with interquartile range) during this period was 108.5 (63.5–133.6) $\mu$g/m³. We found a 0.52% (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.42–0.62%) increase in non-trauma all-cause mortality for every 10 $\mu$g/m³ increase in 6-days cumulative PM2.5 exposure with a relatively higher impact on men (0.57%, 95% CI: 0.46–0.69%) than on women (0.52%, 0.38–0.65%). The impact of PM2.5 was almost two-fold higher in winter (0.55%, 0.45–0.66%) per 10 $\mu$g/m³ increase in PM2.5 than in summer (0.29%, 0.14–0.45%). The district-level aggregated 6-days cumulative PM2.5 exposure had the largest impact on mortality (1.10%, 0.84–1.35%). The impact of acute exposure to PM2.5 on all-cause mortality was larger than that of PM10 exposure (from previous studies). Our study adds to the global evidence pool, fills the critical gap of evidence of acute PM2.5 exposure impact on mortality in India, and most importantly, demonstrates the significance of disaggregated exposure assessment using satellite data to reduce exposure misclassification in health impact studies, particularly in data-poor regions.
Main finding
We estimate a 0.52% increase in all-cause mortality for every 10 $\mu$g/m³ rise in short-term PM2.5 exposure with a two-fold higher impact in the winter than in the summer and a higher impact on male (0.57%) than on female (0.52%) in the megacity Delhi.},

This study investigates the impact of lockdown measures on ambient air pollution and its association with human mobility in 81 cities of Turkey. We conducted a countrywide analysis using PM10 and SO2 measurement data by the Turkish Ministry of Environment and Urbanization and mobility data derived from cellular device movement by Google. We observed the most significant change in April 2020. PM10 and SO2 concentrations were lower in 67% and 59% of the cities, respectively in April 2020 compared to the previous five years (2015–2019). The correlation results show that Restaurant/Caf{\'{e}}, Transit, and Workplaces mobility is significantly correlated with PM10 and SO2 concentration levels in Turkey. This study is the first step of a long-term investigation to understand the air quality impacts on population susceptibility to COVID-19.},

Urbanization and long-term meteorological variations play important roles in influencing the PM2.5 concentration and its associated health effects. Our results indicate that the urbanization process can enhance the PM2.5 concentration globally. The PM2.5-caused mortality density (deaths/100 km2) is also positively correlated with the urbanization degree in both developed and developing countries. The results from machine learning technique revealed that the meteorology-driven variation in PM2.5-caused health burden has increased with the increase in the urbanization degree from 1980 to 2018, suggesting that residents living in urban areas are more vulnerable to experiencing unfavorable meteorological conditions (e.g. low wind speed and planetary boundary layer height). The maximum difference in PM2.5-caused mortality due to the variation in annual meteorological conditions (between 2013 and 1986) was 270 600 (196 800–317 900). Our findings indicate an urgent need to understand the driving force behind the appearance of unfavorable meteorological situations and propose suitable climate mitigation measures.},

We thus assessed the long-term impacts of PM2.5 on body mass index (BMI) and the risk of the prevalence of overweight/obesity (BMI≥25 kg/m2), by incorporating the well-established Prediction for Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Risk in China (China-PAR) project comprising 77,609 participants with satellite-based PM2.5 estimates at 1-km spatial resolution. The average of long-term PM2.5 level was 70.4 $\mu$g/m3, with the range of 32.1–94.2 $\mu$g/m3. Each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increment of PM2.5 was associated with 0.421 kg/m2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.402, 0.439) and 13.5% (95% CI: 12.8%, 14.3%) increased BMI and overweight/obesity risk, respectively. Moreover, compared with the lowest quartile of PM2.5 (≤57.5 $\mu$g/m3), the relative risk of the prevalence of overweight/obesity from the highest quartile (>85.9 $\mu$g/m3) was 1.611 (95% CI: 1.566, 1.657). The exposure-response curve suggested a non-linear relationship between PM2.5 exposure and overweight/obesity. Besides, the association was modified by age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia status. Our study provides the evidence for the adverse impacts of long-term PM2.5 on BMI and overweight/obesity in China, and the findings are important for policy development on air quality, especially in severely polluted areas.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increases the mortality burden. Exposure windows and exposure-response functions (ERFs) are two critical components of accurate mortality burden estimation.
Objective
We explored the potential heterogeneity of exposure windows and reassessed the PM2.5-attributable mortality burden in China with novel ERFs.
Method
Based on 1 km × 1 km satellite-retrieved PM2.5 and population data, provincial-level age structure, and mortality data, we applied the recent Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM) with multiple exposure windows (1-year to 6-year during 2010–2015) to estimate age-specific PM2.5-attributable mortality burden in China in 2015. Then, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 Integrated Exposure-Response (IER) and Log-Linear (LL) models were exercised for comparative analysis.
Result
The PM2.5-attributable mortality was the highest with a 3-year average exposure window (2013–2015). The GEMM-based total premature deaths were 133.2% [95% conﬁdence interval (95% CI): 93.6%–226.4%] and 14.2% (95% CI: 13.9%–16.8%) higher than the values obtained from the GBD2017 IER model and LL model, respectively. The national mortality burden attributable to PM2.5 was 1.94 (95% CI: 1.63–2.23) million, of which IHD and stroke were the leading causes, accounting for 27.3% and 23.0% of the total burden respectively. The mortality burden for the people over 80 years old was 0.62 (95%CI: 0.52–0.71) million, accounting for 31.9% (95%CI: 31.8%–32.0%) of the total burden.
Conclusions
This study demonstrates the potential heterogeneity of PM2.5-attributable mortality burden associated with different exposure windows, especially when there are spatial-temporal variations in PM2.5 concentrations. The model comparison results suggest that the health impacts attributed to long-term PM2.5 exposure in China may be much higher than previously estimated. The population over 80 years old has the highest PM2.5-attributable mortality burden. These findings have important policy implications for addressing air pollution at the provincial and national level in China.},

abstract = {Biomass-burning (BB) related air pollution is a prime concern in several regions of the world including Southeast Asia. This study aimed to identify and apportion the BB types (agricultural, forest, and grassland) and assess the transport of BB-derived PM2.5 which influences the air quality index (AQI) of three major regions (i.e., central, north, and northeast) in Thailand by integrating satellite fire products, air-mass trajectories, ground-based measurements, statistical approaches, and modeling tools. We accounted for the transport time of PM2.5 from source to monitoring stations by grouping the BB type with air-mass trajectory timestamps. Forest fire predominated over the north (73%) and northeast (48%) whereas agricultural burning predominated over the central (52%) region. Grassland burning was most influential in the central region (16%) followed by the northeast (11%) and north (5%) regions in Thailand. Annual PM2.5 exposure amounted to very-unhealthy to hazardous PM2.5-AQI levels for about 79% of the Thailand population. PM2.5-AQI levels over Thailand were mainly governed by transboundary BB influence (67%) whereas the local contribution was about 33%. Excess numbers of premature deaths due to PM2.5 exposure totaled 18,003, and were associated with stroke burden (53%), ischemic heart disease (30%), lung cancer (12%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5%), based on public-health data from 2016. The spatial distribution results of excess mortality showed the largest burden in the central region (44%) followed by the northeast (29%), north (18%), and south (9%). Our study results are useful for shaping effective control strategies of open burning management in Thailand and other nearby countries in peninsular Southeast Asia.},

To explore acute hazards of 39 chemical components of PM2.5 on cause-specific emergency department visits (EDVs) in the Guangzhou, China, we firstly applied geographical detector method to quantify the individual and interactive effects of PM2.5 chemical components on the variability of EDVs. Then, a causal inference framework based on the Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) was developed to estimate the causal impacts that would have had on cause-specific EDVs, under an assumptive intervention via setting median concentration of as the predefined threshold for each PM2.5 component. We found that the pairwise interactions of components play a more important role in explaining the variability of cause-specific EDVs than single factor separately. PM2.5 chemical components combined with gaseous pollutants as well as meteorological factors affect cause-specific diseases. We obtained robust causal estimates that exposures to high levels of vanadium and fluoranthene caused an increase in EDVs for neurological diseases (4.39%; 95% CI: 0.65%, 8.23%) and circulatory diseases (4.72%; 95% CI: 0.12%, 9.63%), respectively. A comprehensive strategy to reduce the hazards of toxic chemical components of PM2.5 is urgently needed.},

This study aimed to compare the childhood exposure to $\Sigma$MLs (essential, non-essential and toxic) in an industrial and an urban area in Southwest Iran using toenail tissue as a biomarker. The present study was carried out with school children in the age range of 7–12 years, who were living in an industrial area in the petrochemical and gas area (PGA) of the Central District of Asaluyeh County and in an urban area (UA) located in the Kaki District. A total of 270 boys and girls were recruited in January to April 2019. The ICP-MS was used for determination of the studied MLs. A multi-linear regression model was constructed to assess the effect of residence area on toenail ML levels. A significantly higher level of $\Sigma$MLs in toenail from the PGA was observed compared to the level in the UA (8.839 vs. 7.081 $\mu$g/g, $\beta$ = -0.169 and p < 0.05). However, all of the 15 MLs studied were detected in the toenail samples from both study sites. Significant differences for the mean Cr ($\beta$ = −0.563), Fe ($\beta$ = −0.968), Mn ($\beta$ = −0.501), Ni ($\beta$ = −0.306), and Pb ($\beta$ = −0.377) levels were found between toenail samples from the study areas (p < 0.05), with higher levels in the PGA. The results of this study suggest that children in industrial area are prone to a greater risk for ML exposures compared with those living in a non-industrial urban area.},

WQC for the protection of human health is established to reflect long-term consumption safety of aquatic products and water. Human health WQC for 15 toxic metals and metalloids based on exposure factors of the Chinese population and 40 field bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were developed and analyzed in this study. Moreover, age-specific (age 2–5, 6–8, 9–11, 12–14, 15–17, and adult) and region-specific (east, central and west China) WQC were analyzed to better understanding of the impact of specific parameter values on WQC. Human health WQC with consumption of fishes and water, consumption of fishes only, and consumption of water only were derived separately. WQC with consumption of water and organism for Hg, Cd, As, Sb, Se, Zn, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, Mn, Sn, Ba, and Sr were 0.0264, 0.710, 0.827, 3.48, 22.1, 25.7, 32.2, 32.9, 35.5, 41.8, 72.1, 97.1, 206 and 2.20 × 103 $\mu$g/L, and were 13.3 and 6.67 × 103 $\mu$g/L for Cr(VI) and Cr(III) with consumption of water only. Comparison of age-specific and region-specific WQC showed that the protection for a specific population should be considered in the development of WQC and WQS, as well as cancer effect for carcinogenic metals. Health risk analysis showed that Cd, Cu, Zn, As, Hg and Mn average concentrations in 7, 5, 9, 22, 11 and 5 provinces exceeded the WQC values with consumption of water and aquatic product, showing potential long-term health risk (HQ ≥ 1) to the local population. Therefore, health risks posed by these metals from dietary intake related to surface water should be paying more attention.},

To investigate the potential cardiotoxic effects of ambient PM exposure and assess the damage to cardiac mitochondria, C57/B6 mice were exposed to filtered air or real ambient PM for three or six weeks. Furthermore, to reveal the role of peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) in PM exposure induced cardiotoxicity/mitochondria damage, animals were also co-treated with PPAR alpha agonist WY 14,643 or PPAR alpha antagonist GW 6471. Cardiotoxicity was assessed with echocardiography and histopathology, while mitochondria damage was evaluated with mitochondria membrane potential measurement and transmission electron microscopy. Potential impacts of PM exposure to PPAR alpha signaling were detected with co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting. The results indicated that exposure to ambient PM exposure induced cardiotoxicity in C57/B6 mice, including altered cardiac functional parameters and morphology. Cardiac mitochondria damage is detected, in the form of compromised mitochondria membrane potential and morphology. Molecular investigations revealed disruption of PPAR alpha interaction with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1A (PGC-1a) as well as altered expression levels of PPAR alpha downstream genes. Co-treatment with WY 14,643 alleviated the observed toxicities, while co-treatment with GW 6471 had mixed results, exaggerating most cardiotoxicity and mitochondrial damage endpoints but alleviating some cardiac functional parameters. Interestingly, WY 14,643 and GW 6471 co-treatment seemed to exhibit similar regulative effects towards PPAR alpha signaling in animals exposed to PM. In conclusion, ambient PM exposure indeed induced cardiotoxicity in C57/B6 mice, in which cardiac mitochondria damage and disrupted PPAR alpha signaling are contributors.},

However, the association between gestational exposure to air pollutants, maternal inflammatory response, and fetal growth remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between exposure to air pollutants during pregnancy and the concentration of inflammatory indicators in maternal and fetal circulations, as well as fetal growth. We recruited 108 healthy pregnant women living in northern (n = 55) and southern (n = 53) areas of Taiwan and prospectively collected information of exposure to outdoor air pollutants throughout gestation. Maternal blood from each trimester and umbilical cord blood after delivery were collected and analyzed for inflammatory indicators including high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$. Our results showed that exposure to particulate matter less than or equal to 10 $\mu$m (PM10) and ozone (O3) during the first trimester had a direct effect on reduction of birth weight, but the direct effect of PM10 mediated by hs-CRP and the direct effect of O3 mediated by TNF-$\alpha$ on fetal birth weight were not significant. Exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 during the second and third trimesters also directly affected birth weight. Furthermore, exposure to sulfur dioxide (SO2) caused changes in the concentrations of TNF-$\alpha$ in maternal blood during the second trimester, which subsequently resulted in reduced fetal weight. Together, these results indicate that exposure to air pollutants may cause both direct and indirect effects on the reduction of fetal weight.},

This study aims to identify the composition of PM2.5 and the main sources of it which influence the indoor and outdoor school environment. The PM2.5 sampling was conducted using a portable low volume air sampler and took place at three different primary schools. The chemical composition of PM2.5 is comprised of water-soluble inorganic ions (WSII) and potentially toxic trace metals. WSII (Cl−, NO3−, SO42−, Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+) were analysed using ion chromatography (IC) and trace metals concentrations (Al, Fe, Zn, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, Ni, As, Co, Cd) using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results showed that the highest average for PM2.5 concentrations in an indoor classroom was recorded at the school located in the industrial area (23.5 $\mu$g/m3) followed by urban (18.6 $\mu$g/m3) and suburban (9.58 $\mu$g/m3). The indoor to outdoor (I/O) ratio values for PM2.5 concentrations were slightly above one, indicating that open doors and windows highly affected indoor PM2.5 concentrations. Source apportionment analysis indicated that the sources of both indoor and outdoor PM2.5 were mixed of natural (crustal, mineral dust and sea salt) and anthropogenic (vehicle, industrial and biomass burning). The hazard quotient (HQ) value was lower than the acceptable limits. The excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) value for all three stations, however, was found to be slightly higher than the acceptable level (1.0E-06) for Cr and Ni.},

abstract = {Background
There are limited studies on the lipidomics of children and adolescents exposed to multiple industrial pollutants.
Objectives
In this study, we aimed to investigate lipid profile perturbations in 99 children and adolescents (aged 9–15) who lived in a polluted area surrounding the largest petrochemical complex in Taiwan. Previous studies have reported increased risks of acute and chronic diseases including liver dysfunctions and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in residents living in this area.
Methods
We measured urinary concentrations of 11 metals and metalloids and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) metabolite 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) as exposure biomarkers, and urinary oxidative stress biomarkers and serum acylcarnitines as early health effect biomarkers. The association between individual exposure biomarkers and early health effect biomarkers were analyzed using linear regression, while association of combined exposure biomarkers with four oxidative stress biomarkers and acylcarnitines were analyzed using weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression. Lipid profiles were analyzed using an untargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based technique. “Meet-in-the-middle” approach was applied to identify potential lipid features that linked multiple industrial pollutants exposure with early health effects.
Results
We identified 15 potential lipid features that linked elevated multiple industrial pollutants exposure with three increased oxidative stress biomarkers and eight deregulated serum acylcarnitines, including one lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), four phosphatidylcholines (PCs), and two sphingomyelins (SMs) that were up-regulated in high exposure group compared to low exposure group, and two LPCs, four PCs, and two phosphatidylinositols (PIs) down-regulated in high exposure group compared to low exposure group.
Conclusion
Our findings could provide information for understanding the health effects, including early indicators and biological mechanism identification, of children and adolescents exposed to multiple industrial pollutants during critical stages of development.},

However, no information is available regarding the occurrence of PM2.5-bound PAHs and XPAHs in Bangladesh, one of the most highly PM2.5-polluted regions worldwide. In this study, we investigated the occurrence of PM2.5-bound PAHs and XPAHs in the atmospheres of Dhaka in Bangladesh and Shizuoka in Japan (as a reference) and estimated their incremental lifetime cancer risks (ILCRs). In addition, we statistically estimated the potential sources of PM2.5-bound PAHs and XPAHs by using principal component analysis and positive matrix factorization. The median concentration of total PM2.5-bound PAHs and XPAHs in Bangladesh was 24.2 times that in Japan. The estimated potential sources of PAHs clearly differed between Japan and Bangladesh, whereas those of XPAHs were largely (>80%) unknown in both countries. The median ILCR in Bangladesh was 2.81 × 10−3, which greatly exceeded the upper limit of acceptable risk (10−4). These results indicate that comprehensive monitoring and control of atmospheric PM2.5-bound PAHs and XPAHs are needed urgently, especially in highly polluted countries.},

abstract = {PM2.5 has a major impact on the gastrointestinal system, but the specific mechanism behind this action is not fully understood. Current studies have focused on the relationship between PM2.5 and intestinal flora disorder, while ignoring the important influence of diet on gut microbes. In this study, SD rats were fed either a normal, high-fat, or high-carbohydrate diet for two months and exposed to PM2.5 (7 mg/kg b.w.) by intratracheal instillation. The results showed that the body and kidney weights of the rats in the high-fat diet group were significantly increased relative to those with a normal diet, and changes in the intestinal microbes and metabolites induced by PM2.5 were observed. Rats in the high-carbohydrate diet group had a significant response, and the diversity and richness indices of the flora were reduced (p < 0.05); additionally, intestinal Biffidobacterium and Lactobacillus were enriched, while many endogenous metabolites were found. Some amino acids derivatives and long-chain fatty acids were increased (p < 0.05). Both diet structure and PM2.5 exposure can affect the composition of gut microbiota, and intestinal metabolites may be associated with cell membrane damage when a high-carbohydrate diet interacts with PM2.5. This study considers multiple dietary factors to further supplement the evidence of intestinal damage via PM2.5.},

abstract = {Atmospheric particulate matter (PM) has been reported to be closely related to cardiovascular adverse events. However, the underlying mode of action remains to be elucidated. Previous studies have documented that PM induces mitochondrial damage and inflammation, the relation between these two biological outcomes is still unclear though. In this study, we used EA.hy926 human vascular endothelial cells and a standard PM, PM SRM1648a to study the potential effects of mitochondrial dysfunction on endothelial inflammatory responses. As a result, PM SRM1648a changes mitochondrial morphology and interrupts mitochondrial dynamics with a persistent tendency of fission in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, the caspase-1/IL-1$\beta$ axis is involved in inflammatory responses but not cell pyroptosis in EA.hy926 cells following the exposure to PM SRM1648a. The activation of caspase-1 has implications in inflammation but not pyroptosis, because caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis is not the main modality of cell death in PM SRM1648a-treated EA.hy926 cells. With regard to the association between mitochondrial damage and inflammation in the case of particle stimulation, DRP1-mediated mitochondrial fission is responsible for inflammatory responses as a result of caspase-1 activation. The current study showed that PM SRM1648a has the ability to disturb mitochondrial dynamics, and trigger endothelial inflammation via DRP1/caspase-1/IL-1$\beta$ regulatory pathway. In a conclusion, mitochondrial fission enables EA.hy926 cells to facilitate caspase-1 activation in response to PM SRM1648a, which is a crucial step for inflammatory reaction in vascular endothelial cells.},

We investigated the association between short- and medium-term outdoor air pollution exposure with protein profiles and their link with blood pressure in 1170 HELIX children aged 6–11 years. Different air pollutants (NO2, PM10, PM2.5, and PM2.5abs) were estimated based on residential and school addresses at three different windows of exposure (1-day, 1-week, and 1-year before clinical and molecular assessment). Thirty-six proteins, including adipokines, cytokines, or apolipoproteins, were measured in children's plasma using Luminex. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) were measured following a standardized protocol. We performed an association study for each air pollutant at each location and time window and each outcome, adjusting for potential confounders. After correcting for multiple-testing, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and interleukin 8 (IL8) levels were positively associated with 1-week home exposure to some of the pollutants (NO2, PM10, or PM2.5). NO2 1-week home exposure was also related to higher SBP. The mediation study suggested that HGF could explain 19% of the short-term effect of NO2 on blood pressure, but other study designs are needed to prove the causal directionality between HGF and blood pressure.},

We selected 313,355 participants satisfying inclusion criteria from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort based on the nationwide population of South Korea, and followed them up from January 2007 through December 2015. Individual-level long-term PM exposure was assessed as the five time-varying average concentrations estimated for the previous 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years on each year (until censored or event occurred) at the district-level residential addresses of participants using a previously validated prediction model. Incident PD was defined as the first diagnosis accompanied by anti-PD medication prescription from 2007 through 2015. Time-varying Cox proportional hazards models were employed to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of incident PD for long-term PM exposure, adjusting for individual- and area-level covariates. During the 8 years (2,745,389 person-years) of follow-up for a total of 313,355 participants (mean [range] age, 48.9 [19–87] years; 169,571 males [54.1%]), 2621 participants (0.8%) developed PD. The HR of incident PD per interquartile range (3.3 $\mu$g/m3) increase in fine PM (PM2.5) for the previous 1 year was 1.08 (95% confidence interval: 1.01–1.19). In subgroup-specific analyses, HRs for PM2.5 were significant among older participants, males, participants living in metropolitan cities, ibuprofen users, and participants with comorbidities (HR: 1.10–1.20).

abstract = {Background
Air pollution may cause inflammatory and oxidative stress damage to the brain, leading to neurodegenerative disease. The association between air pollution and dementia, and modification by apolipoprotein E genotype 4 (APOE-$\epsilon$4) has yet to be fully investigated.
Objectives
To examine associations of air pollution with three types of incident dementias (Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and vascular dementia (VAD)), and their potential modification by APOE-$\epsilon$4 genotype.
Methods
The UK Biobank enrolled >500,000 participants (2006–2010) with ongoing follow-up. We used annual averages of air pollution (PM2.5, PM10, PM2.5-10, PM2.5absorbance, NO2, NOX) for 2010 scaled to interquartile ranges (IQR). We included individuals aged ≥60 years, with no dementia diagnosis prior to January 1, 2010. Time to incident dementia and follow-up time were reported from baseline (January 01, 2010) to last censor event (death, last hospitalization, or loss to follow-up). Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to estimate the association of air pollutants and incident dementia, and modification of these associations by APOE-$\epsilon$4.
Results
Our sample included 187,194 individuals (including N = 680 AD, N = 377 VAD, N = 63 FTD) with a mean follow-up of 7.04 years. We observed consistent associations of PM2.5 with greater risk of all-cause dementia (HR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.24) and AD (HR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.29). NO2 was also associated with greater risk of any incident dementia (HR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.25), AD (HR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.28) and VAD (HR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.35). APOE-$\epsilon$4 did not modify the association between any air pollutants and dementia.
Discussion
PM2.5 and NO2 levels were associated with several types of dementia, and these associations were not modified by APOE-$\epsilon$4. Findings from the UK Biobank support and extend to other epidemiological evidence for the potential association of air pollutants with detrimental brain health during aging.},

abstract = {Natural environments have been linked to decreased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and respiratory disease (RSD) mortality. However, few cohort studies have looked at associations of natural environments with CVD or RSD hospitalization. The aim of this study was to evaluate these associations in a cohort of U.S. Medicare beneficiaries (∼63 million individuals). Our open cohort included all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries (2000–2016), aged ≥65, living in the contiguous U.S. We assessed zip code-level park cover based on the United States Geological Survey Protected Areas Database, average greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI), and percent blue space cover based on Landsat satellite images. Cox-equivalent Poisson models were used to estimate associations of the exposures with first CVD and RSD hospitalization in the full cohort and among those living in urban zip codes (≥1000 persons/mile2). NDVI was weakly negatively correlated with percent park cover (Spearman $\rho$ = −0.23) and not correlated with percent blue space (Spearman $\rho$ = 0.00). After adjustment for potential confounders, percent park cover was not associated with CVD or RSD hospitalization in the full or urban population. An IQR (0.27) increase in NDVI was negatively associated with CVD (HR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.96, 0.97), but not with RSD hospitalization (HR: 0.99, 95%CI: 0.98, 1.00). In urban zip codes, an IQR increase in NDVI was positively associated with RSD hospitalization (HR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1.00, 1.03). In stratified analyses, percent park cover was negatively associated with CVD and RSD hospitalization for Medicaid eligible individuals and individuals living in low socioeconomic status neighborhoods in the urban population. We observed no associations of percent blue space cover with CVD or RSD hospitalization. This study suggests that natural environments may benefit cardiorespiratory health; however, benefits may be limited to certain contexts and certain health outcomes.},

However, previous studies mostly focused on the direct health impacts of aerosols and meteorological conditions in the boundary layer and little is known about the health impacts associated with aerosol-PBL interactions. We quantitatively estimate the impacts of PM2.5 and air temperature on mortality caused by aerosol-PBL interactions. Utilizing the WRF-Chem model, we conducted a one-month numerical simulation during December 2015 in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, one of the most polluted regions with the highest population density in China. We simulated PM2.5 concentrations and air temperature under two scenarios: with/without considering the aerosol-PBL interactions. Based on the simulation data, we adopted the distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) to establish the exposure-response associations of PM2.5 and temperature with mortality and calculated the population-weighted exposure levels of PM2.5 and temperature. During December 2015 in the BTH region, the additional PM2.5-related and temperature-related deaths were 312 due to respiratory and circulatory disease. Without considering the aerosol-PBL interactions, the population-weighted average levels of both PM2.5 and temperature increased compared with the average levels. However, after considering the aerosol-PBL interactions, the population-weighted average temperature was decreased, while the population-weighted average PM2.5 concentration was increased. In the BTH region, more people lived in areas with high PM2.5 concentrations where have strong aerosol-PBL interactions. The aerosol-PBL interactions could intensify the adverse health impacts of temperature and PM2.5, which should not be neglected when to assess the health effects of aerosol and meteorological conditions.},

Since DNA damage and metabolite alterations are associated with cancer progression, exploring potential mechanisms linking air pollution and cancer might be meaningful. In this study, a real-time ambient air exposure system was established to simulate the real-world environment of adult male SD rats in Beijing from June 13th, 2018, to October 8th, 2018. 8-OHdG in the urine, $\gamma$-H2AX in the lungs and mtDNA copy number in the peripheral blood were analyzed to explore DNA damage at different levels. Serum non-targeted metabolomics analysis was performed. Pair-wise spearman was used to explore the correlation between DNA damage biomarkers and serum differential metabolites. Carcinogenic risks of heavy metals and PAHs via inhalation were assessed according to US EPA guidelines. Results showed that PM2.5 and O3 were the major air pollutants in the exposure group and not detected in the control group. Compared with control group, higher levels of 8-OHdG, mtDNA copy number, $\gamma$-H2AX and PCNA-positive nuclei cells were observed in the exposure group. Histopathological evaluation suggested ambient air induced alveolar wall thickening and inflammatory cell infiltration in lungs. Perturbed metabolic pathways identified included glycolysis/gluconeogenesis metabolism, purine and pyrimidine metabolism, etc. $\gamma$-H2AX was positively correlated with serum ADP, 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. The BaPeq was 0.120 ng/m3. Risks of Cr(VI), As, V, BaP, BaA and BbF were above 1 × 10−6. We concluded that low-level air pollution was associated with DNA damage and serum metabolomic alterations in rats. Cr(VI) and BaP were identified as key carcinogenic components in PM2.5. Our results provided experimental evidence for hazard identification and risk assessment of low-level air pollution.},

abstract = {Background
Prenatal exposure to ambient air pollution has been associated with adverse offspring health outcomes. Childhood health effects of prenatal exposures may be mediated through changes to DNA methylation detectable at birth.
Methods
Among 429 non-smoking women in a cohort study of mother-infant pairs in Colorado, USA, we estimated associations between prenatal exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3), and epigenome-wide DNA methylation of umbilical cord blood cells at delivery (2010–2014). We calculated average PM2.5 and O3 in each trimester of pregnancy and the full pregnancy using inverse-distance-weighted interpolation. We fit linear regression models adjusted for potential confounders and cell proportions to estimate associations between air pollutants and methylation at each of 432,943 CpGs. Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified using comb-p. Previously in this cohort, we reported positive associations between 3rd trimester O3 exposure and infant adiposity at 5 months of age. Here, we quantified the potential for mediation of that association by changes in DNA methylation in cord blood.
Results
We identified several DMRs for each pollutant and period of pregnancy. The greatest number of significant DMRs were associated with third trimester PM2.5 (21 DMRs). No single CpGs were associated with air pollutants at a false discovery rate <0.05. We found that up to 8% of the effect of 3rd trimester O3 on 5-month adiposity may be mediated by locus-specific methylation changes, but mediation estimates were not statistically significant.
Conclusions
Differentially methylated regions in cord blood were identified in association with maternal exposure to PM2.5 and O3. Genes annotated to the significant sites played roles in cardiometabolic disease, immune function and inflammation, and neurologic disorders. We found limited evidence of mediation by DNA methylation of associations between third trimester O3 exposure and 5-month infant adiposity.},

Short-term exposure to multiple air pollutants, especially NO2 and SO2, was associated with adult primary insomnia visits. A 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in NO2 and SO2 at lag 05 corresponded to increased primary insomnia outpatient visits 3.87% (95% CI: 1.50%–6.24%) and 7.22% (95% CI: 2.10%–12.35%), respectively. Moreover, stronger links were presented in females and cool seasons for NO2 while in the elderly for SO2.

abstract = {Background
In cities suffering from heavy environmental pressure or pollution, it is extremely important to rapidly access municipal demographics that can be used as indicators of population health status. Among those, mortality rates represent the most reliable data as they are officially retained and available to municipality with high level of details, thus allowing epidemiological comparison between different neighborhoods of the city across several years. Our study was aimed at validating and propose as universally applicable approach the use of municipal demographics as first-line tool to rapidly assess population health and drive health policies or urban planning in cities characterized by heavy environmental pressure. The case study of Taranto has been chosen due to the presence of the biggest European steel plant since 1960s resulting in heavy burden on environment and population health.
Methods
We have performed an ecological study on general mortality data due to all causes, specific by gender, age groups and disaggregated at sub-municipal level (highest data granularity) into neighborhoods from 2011 to 2020 by using official demographics related to all people living in Taranto available at General Registry Office of the municipality. A preliminary analysis comparing data available at Municipality and those provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) was performed and confirmed the high level of reliability of the municipal source of data. For comparative analyses, we used Regional demographics and mortality from ISTAT. Indirect age-standardized mortality ratios (SMR; CI 90% and 95%), specific for gender and neighborhoods, were calculated in reference to the city of Taranto and Apulia Region; direct age-standardized and neighborhoods mortality rates were computed on city population.
Results
The city of Taranto shows relevant inequalities in terms of mortality between the northern neighborhoods, closest to the industrial area (Paolo VI, Tamburi and Citt{\`{a}} Vecchia-Borgo), with excess mortality highlighted across 10 years described by SMRs always higher than those of the entire Apulia region, with peaks exceeding 50% between 2015 and 2017 both in women and men. The significant excesses of mortality have increased from 2011 to 2020 and progressively extended across several neighborhoods of Taranto city. Compared to the Apulia region, in the 3 Northern neighborhoods of the city (Paolo VI, Tamburi and Citt{\`{a}} Vecchia-Borgo) a total of 1020 excess deaths were recorded from 2011 to 2019 in both males and females (showing statistical significance), with a peak of 68% mortality excess in 2019 for men living in Paolo VI district.
Conclusion
The use of official mortality data allows a timely, reliable and costless assessment of population health in cities heavily impacted by environmental pollution like Taranto.},

To estimate the impact of short- and long-term exposure to PM2.5 on hospital admission (HA) risks of circulatory diseases, respiratory diseases, mental disorders, endocrine and metabolic diseases, allergic diseases, urogenital diseases and malignant tumors respectively in an exposed population (by gender and age groups).
Methods
Based on the data of ambient PM2.5 concentration and HAs in Beijing from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2014, the spatial-temporal method is employed for a mixed Poisson regression model to integrate both short- and long-term exposure simultaneously when estimating the risk of HAs in the whole and subgroup population.
Results
The HA risks of mental disorders, urogenital diseases, diabetes and malignant tumors of the exposed population were associated with higher short-term ambient PM2.5 exposure. Positive associations between long-term PM2.5 exposure and the HAs were found for ischemic stroke, respiratory diseases, endocrine and metabolic diseases, allergic diseases, urogenital diseases, and malignant tumors (except lung cancer). The estimates of PM2.5-HA associations varied by sex and age groups.
Conclusion
Ambient PM2.5 levels were positively associated with previously identified causes of HAs such as circulatory and respiratory diseases, as well as several prevalent but rarely studied diseases such as mental disorders, endocrine and metabolic diseases, allergic diseases, urogenital diseases, and malignant tumors (except lung cancer). The health losses caused by PM2.5 exposure could be underestimated if only circulatory and respiratory diseases were considered. Sex and age were modifying factors for the PM2.5-HA associations.},

abstract = {Atmospheric pollution is a major environmental and public health risk due to its effect on global air quality and climate. Increase in pollutants concentrations, especially particulate matter (PM), are associated with increased respiratory diseases. The pathophysiology of respiratory diseases involves molecular and cellular mechanisms as inflammatory biomarkers and reactive oxygen species production. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the in vitro cytotoxic and pro-inflammatory effects of particulate matter (PM) of six monitoring stations (1–6) from the Vitoria Metropolitan Area (VMA), Espirito Santo, Brazil in 2018. The PM was chemically characterized by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In vitro cytotoxic effects of PM (3.12–200.0 $\mu$g/mL) were analyzed in human lung epithelial cells (A549) and macrophage cells (RAW 264.7) by MTT assay (3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide). To investigate the pro-inflammatory effects of PM in RAW 264.7 cells, the levels of proinflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), superoxide anion (O2•-), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-$\alpha$), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF- $\kappa$B) were measured. The comet assay evaluated genotoxicity. Cell cycle, oxidative stress (DCF and DHE), and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Chemical analysis of PM revealed aluminum (Al) and Iron (Fe) as the major chemical elements in all studied monitoring stations. In addition, worrying concentrations of mercury (Hg) were detected in the PM. The in vitro results showed that PM presents a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect in macrophage and pulmonary epithelial cell lines. The PM increased the production of NO, O2•-, and pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-6. PM also promoted alterations in the cell cycle, increased apoptosis frequency, and DNA damage. Moreover, PM increased the expression NF-$\kappa$B. In addition, a positive correlation between Al and Fe and ROS production was observed. Based on the results obtained during the study period, it was concluded that the sedimented particles from the VMA might have deleterious effects on human health, which was evidenced by the increase in oxidative stress, an increase in pro-inflammatory mediators, and genotoxic effects partially mediated by the NF-$\kappa$B pathway. These results add aspects to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the effects of sedimented particles in vivo and in vitro.},

This study was performed on a subset of participants from the UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010. The land use regression (LUR) model was constructed to calculate the concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Binary logistic/multivariate linear regression models were applied to explore the potential linear relationships between air pollution exposure and newborn low birth weight (LBW) or BW. The Cochran-Armitage trend test was used to explore the possible association between the air pollution level and LBW. A restricted cubic spline (RCS) transformation of exposure variables was applied to visualize the relation of air pollutants to BW. Exposure to air pollutants, especially PM2.5 and PM10, was positively associated with LBW, and the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each 10-$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 and PM10 were 1.25 ([1.03, 1.51], P = 0.025) and 1.12 ([1.02, 1.24], P = 0.021), respectively. A negative correlation was observed between the BW and PM2.5 (−0.05 [-0.08, −0.02], P = 0.001), PM10 (−0.03 [-0.05, −0.02], P < 0.001), PM2.5-10 (−0.04 [-0.07, −0.01], P < 0.001) and NOx (0.00 [0.00, 0.00], P = 0.021). Additionally, the BW changed dramatically up to a specific point (PM2.5 for 10.74 $\mu$g/m3, Pnonlinearity = 0.004; PM10 for 16.06 $\mu$g/m3, Pnonlinearity = 0.004; NO2 for 25.58 $\mu$g/m3, Pnonlinearity <0.001; and NOx for 39.88 $\mu$g/m3, Pnonlinearity <0.001), subsequently becoming relatively stable. PM2.5 and PM10 exposure were positively associated with LBW, and a negative correlation was observed between PM2.5, PM2.5-10, PM10 and NOx and BW.},

We used geocoded participant address-specific mean ambient carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NO2; NOx), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations estimated over the 2-, 7-, 28-, and 365-day periods before collection of blood samples used to generate Illumina 450 k array leukocyte DNAm measurements. We estimated methylome-wide, subpopulation- and race/ethnicity-stratified pollutant-DNAm associations in multi-level, linear mixed-effects models adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioral, meteorological, and technical covariates. We combined stratum-specific estimates in inverse variance-weighted meta-analyses and characterized significant associations (false discovery rate; FDR<0.05) at Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites without among-strata heterogeneity (PCochran's Q > 0.05). We attempted replication in the Cooperative Health Research in Region of Augsburg (KORA) study and Normative Aging Study (NAS). We observed a −0.3 (95% CI: −0.4, −0.2) unit decrease in percent DNAm per interquartile range (IQR, 7.3 ppb) increase in 28-day mean NO2 concentration at cg01885635 (chromosome 3; regulatory region 290 bp upstream from ZNF621; FDR = 0.03). At intragenic sites cg21849932 (chromosome 20; LIME1; intron 3) and cg05353869 (chromosome 11; KLHL35; exon 2), we observed a −0.3 (95% CI: −0.4, −0.2) unit decrease (FDR = 0.04) and a 1.2 (95% CI: 0.7, 1.7) unit increase (FDR = 0.04), respectively, in percent DNAm per IQR (17.6 ppb) increase in 7-day mean ozone concentration. Results were not fully replicated in KORA and NAS. We identified three CpG sites potentially susceptible to gaseous air pollution-induced DNAm changes near genes relevant for cardiovascular and lung disease. Further harmonized investigations with a range of gaseous pollutants and averaging durations are needed to determine the effect of gaseous air pollutants on DNA methylation and ultimately gene expression.},

abstract = {There is a growing concern that air pollution exacerbates mental disorders. However, studies assessing the relationship between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and acute exacerbation of psychotic symptoms in psychiatric disorders are limited. This study aims to examine the association between short-term air pollution exposure and acute exacerbation of psychosis in diverse psychiatric disorders. We analyzed 15,917 patients with psychosis (schizophrenia and related disorders and mood disorders with psychotic features) who visited Emergency Departments (EDs) in Seoul, South Korea, between 2008 and 2016. We estimated short-term exposures to particles <2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), particles <10 $\mu$m (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO). We employed a conditional logistic regression with a time-stratified case-crossover design to compare the levels of ambient air pollution on ED visit days with those on control days. Results show that the risk of ED visits for psychosis was significantly associated with interquartile range increases in PM2.5 (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.028; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.006, 1.049), PM10 (OR = 1.022; 95% CI: 1.003, 1.040), NO2 (OR = 1.037; 95% CI: 1.007, 1.068), and SO2 (OR = 1.030; 95% CI: 1.003, 1.058) in the best-fitting lags. Exposure to the highest quartile of air pollutants generally showed a higher risk for psychosis. The associations were higher among male patients, those with schizophrenia and related disorders, and in the cold season. This study provides new evidence that short-term exposure to elevated levels of air pollutants may increase the risk of acute exacerbation of psychosis. These findings could contribute to the development of policies for reducing air pollution levels and the presentation of psychoses. Further studies are warranted to elucidate our findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.},

abstract = {Policies to improve air quality need to be based on effective plans for reducing anthropogenic emissions. In 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant reductions of anthropogenic pollutant emissions, offering an unexpected opportunity to observe their consequences on ambient concentrations. Taking the national lockdown occurred in Italy between March and May 2020 as a case study, this work tries to infer if and what lessons may be learnt concerning the impact of emission reduction policies on air quality. Variations of NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were calculated from numerical model simulations obtained with business as usual and lockdown specific emissions. Both simulations were performed at national level with a horizontal resolution of 4 km, and at local level on the capital city Rome at 1 km resolution. Simulated concentrations showed a good agreement with in-situ observations, confirming the modelling systems capability to reproduce the effects of emission reductions on ambient concentration variations, which differ according to the individual air pollutant. We found a general reduction of pollutant concentrations except for ozone, that experienced an increase in Rome and in the other urban areas, and a decrease elsewhere. The obtained results suggest that acting on precursor emissions, even with sharp reductions like those experienced during the lockdown, may lead to significant, albeit complex, reduction patterns for secondary pollutant concentrations. Therefore, to be more effective, reduction measures should be carefully selected, involving more sectors than those related to mobility, such as residential and agriculture, and integrated on different scales.},

abstract = {Introduction
While the associations among ambient pollutants and various pregnancy complications are well documented, the effect of ambient pollutants on intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) has not been examined. This study aimed to explore the effects of ambient pollutants and sunshine duration on ICP.
Methods
The study enrolled 169,971 pregnant women who delivered between 2015 and 2020 in two hospitals. The associations between ICP and exposure to ambient pollutants and sunshine duration, averaged throughout different periods (including the 3 months before conception, 1st trimester and 2nd trimester), were estimated using a generalized linear model. The interaction effects of ambient pollutants and sunshine duration on ICP were estimated.
Results
The fitted curves for ICP incidence were similar to the temporal trends of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO and NO2 but not that of O3. The risk of ICP was significantly elevated following a 10-$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 (aOR [adjusted odds ratio] = 1.057, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 1.017–1.099) and PM10 (aOR = 1.043, 95% CI: 1.013–1.074) and a 1-h decrease in sunshine duration (aOR = 1.039, 95% CI: 1.011–1.068) during the 3 months before conception. In the second trimester, a 1-$\mu$g/m3 increase in the concentration of SO2 was associated with an increased risk of ICP (aOR = 1.011, 95% CI: 1.001–1.021). Increased concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 had interactive effects with reduced sunshine duration during the 3 months before conception on increasing the risk of ICP.
Conclusions
Exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 during the 3 months before conception and exposure to SO2 in the second trimester were associated with an increased ICP risk. Reduced sunshine duration had an interactive effect with increased concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 during the 3 months before conception on the occurrence of ICP.},

However, the evidence on the association of TRAP exposure and neonatal anthropometric measurements (NAPM) in low and middle-income countries is very scarce yet. Therefore, we investigate the association of prenatal exposure to indicators of traffic and ambient particulate matter (PM) with NAPM. This cross-sectional study was based on hospital medical records of 4053 mother-neonate pairs between May 16, 2016, and December 5, 2018. PMs were estimated at residential addresses based on validated spatiotemporal models. Moreover, total street length in 100, 300 and 500m buffers around the home, residential distance to the ring road, major roads, heavy-traffic lights, gas station, motorway junction, bank, square, bus terminal, public parking and industrial land-use were calculated as indicators of traffic. The head circumference (HC), birth weight (BW) and birth length (BL) of neonates were collected as NAPM. Multivariate regression models were applied to evaluate the relationship between PMs and indicators of traffic with NAPM, controlled for relevant covariates. The median (IQR) of BW, BL, and HC of newborns were 3250 (592) gr, 51.0 (3.5) cm, 35 (2) cm, respectively. The adjusted models revealed that higher exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 was significantly related with lower BW and BL. Similar results were observed for total street length in a 100 m buffer around maternal home with BW and BL. Moreover, higher distance to heavy traffic lights was significantly associated with higher BW and BL. An IQR increase in PM10 was significantly related to lower HC (95% CI: 0.11, −0.01, P-value = 0.03). An increase in distance from residential address to heavy traffic lights, ring roads, bus terminal, and transportation land-use was associated with higher HC. Overall, our findings suggested that higher prenatal exposure to TRAP was related with lower BW, BL and HC.},

abstract = {Background
Early life exposure to air pollution can affect lung health. Previous studies have not assessed the implications of both pre- and postnatal exposure to air pollutants on lung function at repeated ages during childhood. In addition, there is the need to identify potential mediators of such effect.
Objectives
To longitudinally assess the association between pre- and postnatal air pollution exposure and lung function during childhood. We also aimed to explore the role of Club cell secretory protein (CC16) as a potential mediator in this association.
Methodology
We included 487 mother-child pairs from the INMA (INfancia y Medio Ambiente) Sabadell birth cohort, recruited between 2004 and 2006. Air pollution exposure was estimated for pregnancy, pre-school age, and school-age using temporally adjusted land use regression (LUR) modelling. Lung function was measured at ages 4, 7, 9 and 11 by spirometry. At age 4, serum CC16 levels were determined in 287 children. Multivariable linear regression models and linear mixed modelling were applied, while considering potential confounders.
Results
Prenatal exposure to Particulate Matter (PM)10 and PMcoarse had the most consistent associations with reduced lung function in cross-sectional models. Associations with postnatal exposure were less consistent. Increasing CC16 levels at 4 years were associated with an increase in FEF25-75 ($\beta$ = 120.4 mL, 95% CI: 6.30, 234.5) from 4 to 11 years of age. No statistically significant associations were found between pre- or postnatal air pollution and CC16 at age 4.
Conclusion
Increasing levels of air pollution exposure, particularly prenatal PM10 and PMcoarse exposure, were associated with a reduction in lung function. We were not able to confirm our hypothesis on the mediation role of CC16 in this association, however our results encourage further exploration of this possibility in future studies.},

abstract = {Introduction
There is an increasing interest in understanding whether air pollutants modify the quantitative relationships between temperature and health outcomes. The results of available studies were, however, inconsistent. This study aims to sum up the current evidence and provide a comprehensive understanding of this topic.
Methods
We conducted an electronic search in PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. The modified Navigation Guide was applied to evaluate the quality and strength of evidence. We calculated pooled temperature-related mortality at low and high pollutant levels respectively, using the random-effects model.
Results
We identified 22 eligible studies, eleven of which were included in the meta-analysis. Significant effect modification was observed on heat effects for all-cause and non-accidental mortality by particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <10 $\mu$m (PM10) and ozone (O3) (p < 0.05). The excess risks (ERs) for all-cause and non-accidental mortality were 5.4% (4.4%, 6.4%) and 6.3% (4.8%, 7.8%) at the low PM10 level, 8.8% (7.5%, 10.1%) and 11.4% (8.7%, 14.2%) at the high PM10 level, respectively. As for O3, the ERs for all-cause and non-accidental mortality were 5.1% (3.9%, 6.3%) and 3.6% (0.1%, 7.2%) at the low O3 level, 7.6% (6.3%, 9.0%) and 12.5% (4.7%, 20.9%) at the high O3 level, respectively. Surprisingly, the heat effects on cardiovascular mortality were found to be lower at high carbon monoxide (CO) levels [ERs = 5.4% (3.9%, 6.9%)] than that at low levels [ERs = 9.4% (7.0%, 11.9%)]. The heterogeneity varied, but the results of sensitivity analyses were generally robust. Significant effect modification by air pollutants was not observed for heatwave or cold effects.
Conclusions
PM10 and O3 modify the heat-related all-cause and non-accidental mortality, indicating that policymakers should consider air pollutants when establishing heat-health warning systems. Future studies with comparable designs and settings are needed.},

abstract = {Abstract:
Background
Ambient particulate matter is a leading risk factor for disease globally. Particulate matter 10 (PM10) and particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) are derived from different sources, including operating motor vehicles as well as from industrial activities. In this study we investigate the association between increased concentrations of PM and total daily visits to the psychiatric emergency unit (PEV). Further, the aim is to identify specific risk groups who are more susceptible to the effects of air pollution exposure by studying sex, age, ongoing psychiatric follow-up and diagnoses of depression/anxiety or substance use.
Material and methods
The sample was comprised of data from 2740 days to 81 548 PEVs at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg and daily mean concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5. A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to analyse associations between air pollution and PEVs.
Results
Mean number of daily PEVs were 35 and sex distribution was even. PM exposure was associated with total PEV at lag 0 (the same day), by RR 1.016 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.004–1.028) and RR 1.020 (95%CI 1.003–1.038) per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. In females, PEV were increased at lag 0 and lag 1, and in males at lag 1 and lag 2. In the age-stratified analysis, PEVs significantly increased following PM exposure amongst individuals aged 35–65 years by lag 0–2 and in individuals who had contact with outpatient care at lag 0 to lag 1. There were no associations between air pollution and PEVs for any specific diagnostic group evaluated (amongst depression, anxiety and substance use disorder).
Conclusions
The results indicate that acute exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 may trigger acute worsening in mental health in both males and females, especially among 35–65 year old individuals. However, in subgroups of the most common psychiatric diagnoses, we did not observe statistically significant associations with PM exposure.},

Previous experimental studies suggest that particles in diesel exhaust induce oxidative stress, inflammation and DNA damage in kidney cells, but the evidence from population studies linking air pollution to kidney cancer is limited. Methods: We pooled six European cohorts (N = 302,493) to assess the association of residential exposure to fine particles (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), black carbon (BC), warm season ozone (O3) and eight elemental components of PM2.5 (copper, iron, potassium, nickel, sulfur, silicon, vanadium, and zinc) with cancer of the kidney parenchyma. The main exposure model was developed for year 2010. We defined kidney parenchyma cancer according to the International Classification of Diseases 9th and 10th Revision codes 189.0 and C64. We applied Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders at the individual and area-level. Results: The participants were followed from baseline (1985–2005) to 2011–2015. A total of 847 cases occurred during 5,497,514 person-years of follow-up (average 18.2 years). Median (5–95%) exposure levels of NO2, PM2.5, BC and O3 were 24.1 $\mu$g/m3 (12.8–39.2), 15.3 $\mu$g/m3 (8.6–19.2), 1.6 10−5 m−1 (0.7–2.1), and 87.0 $\mu$g/m3 (70.3–97.4), respectively. The results of the fully adjusted linear analyses showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92, 1.15) per 10 $\mu$g/m³ NO2, 1.04 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.21) per 5 $\mu$g/m³ PM2.5, 0.99 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.11) per 0.5 10−5 m−1 BCE, and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.02) per 10 $\mu$g/m³ O3. We did not find associations between any of the elemental components of PM2.5 and cancer of the kidney parenchyma. Conclusion: We did not observe an association between long-term ambient air pollution exposure and incidence of kidney parenchyma cancer.},

abstract = {Background
Few studies have examined the effects of multi-pollutant air pollution on renal health, especially in children and adolescents. This study investigated the association between long-term ambient air pollution exposure and renal health in Asian children and adolescents.
Methods
This study included 10,942 children and adolescents from Taiwan and Hong Kong between 2000 and 2017. PM2.5, NO2 and O3 concentrations were estimated using satellite-based spatiotemporal regression models. Two-year average concentrations, those of the year of visit and the preceding year, were used. Linear mixed models were used to examine the association between air pollution and yearly changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Cox regression models with time-dependent covariates were used to examine the association between air pollution and the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Results
Median age of the participants was 19 years (range: 2–25). The overall average concentration of PM2.5, NO2 and O3 was 26.7 $\mu$g/m3, 44.1 $\mu$g/m3 and 51.1 $\mu$g/m3, respectively. The mean yearly change in eGFR was 0.37 $\mu$L/min/1.73 m2 and the incidence rate of CKD was 6.8 per 1,000 person-years. In single-pollutant models, each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 0.45 $\mu$L/min/1.73 m2 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.28–0.63] reduction in the yearly increase in eGFR and 53% [hazard ratio (HR): 1.53 (95%CI: 1.07–2.2)] greater risk of incident CKD. Each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in NO2 was associated with a 7% [HR (95%CI): 1.07 (1.00–1.15)] higher risk of incident CKD, while an equivalent increase in O3 was associated with a 19% [HR (95%CI): 0.81 (0.67–0.98)] lower risk.
Conclusions
Long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 and NO2 was associated with a slower growth of eGFR and a higher risk of incident CKD in children and adolescents. Our findings suggest that air pollution control in early life is imperative to improve lifelong renal health and alleviate the CKD burden.},

abstract = {Previous studies assessing adverse health have traditionally focused on a single environmental exposure, failing to reflect the reality of various exposures present simultaneously. Air pollution, ambient temperature and greenness have been proposed as critical environmental factors associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, evidence exploring their joint relationships with MetS is needed for identifying interactive factors and developing more targeted public health interventions. The baseline data was obtained from China Multi-Ethnic Cohort (CMEC). Environmental data of air pollutants (PM2.5, O3) and NDVI for greenness was calculated from satellites data. Ambient temperature data were obtained from European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). MetS was classified based on National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) using anthropometric measures and biomarkers. Logistic regression models were utilized to examine the combined relationship of MetS with three-year exposure to air pollutants, temperature and NDVI. Relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) was calculated to evaluate interaction on an additive scale. We found associations between prevalent MetS and interquartile range (IQR) increases in PM2.5 (OR: 1.38; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.23, 1.55) and O3 (OR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.22). Additive and multiplicative interactions were observed between air pollutants and temperature exposure. Compared to low-temperature level, the relationship between PM2.5 and MetS attenuated (RERI: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.44, −0.04) at high-temperature level, while the relationship between O3 and MetS enhanced (RERI: 0.05, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.11). At low NDVI 250 m, the association between PM2.5 and MetS was stronger (RERI: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.19) with high NDVI 250 m as the reference group. Our findings showed that ambient temperature and residential greenness could affect the relationship between air pollutants and MetS.},

abstract = {Long-term exposure to air pollution has been associated with increased natural-cause mortality, but the evidence on diagnoses-specific mortality outcomes is limited. Few studies have examined the potential synergistic effects of exposure to pollutants and greenness. We investigated the association between exposure to air pollution and greenness with nervous system related mortality, cardiometabolic and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) mortality in Greece, using an ecological study design. We collected socioeconomic and mortality data for 1035 municipal units from the 2011 Census. Annual PM2.5, NO2, BC and O3 concentrations for 2010 were predicted at 100 × 100 m grids by hybrid land use regression models. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used for greenness. We applied single and two-exposure Poisson regression models on standardized mortality rates accounting for spatial autocorrelation. We assessed interactions between pollutants and greenness. An interquartile range increase in PM2.5, NO2 and BC was associated with increased risk in mortality from diseases of the nervous system (relative risk (RR): 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01, 1.28); 1.03 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.07); 1.05 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.10) respectively) and from cerebrovascular disease (RR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.18); 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.04); 1.02 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.04) respectively). PM2.5 was associated with ischemic heart disease mortality (RR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.10). We estimated inverse associations for all outcomes with O3 and for mortality from diseases of the nervous system or COPD with greenness. Estimates were mostly robust to co-exposure adjustment. Interactions were identified between NDVI and O3 or PM2.5 on mortality from the diseases of the nervous system, with higher effect estimates in greener areas. Our findings support the adverse effects of air pollution and the beneficial role of greenness on cardiovascular and nervous system related mortality. Further research is needed on diabetes mellitus.},

Traffic related air pollution (TRAP) is associated with a complex and diverse array of health effects. It is unknown whether these effects may be reflected by higher health care costs.
Objectives
Evaluate the association between TRAP exposure and direct health care costs in an elderly population.
Methods
This multi-ethnic population-based cohort of 25,684 elderly subjects, served by Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), were followed between 2013 and 2017. Hyperlocal long-term pollutant concentrations for nitrogen dioxide [NO2], nitric oxide [NO], and black carbon [BC] were measured at a resolution of 30 m using repeated street-level mobile measurements and linked to residential addresses. Health care utilization and costs were derived from KPNC databases and were used to calculate individual annual total health care, inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room (ER) and pharmacy costs. The associations between TRAP exposures and health care costs were evaluated using generalized estimating equation models adjusted for age, sex, race, BMI, smoking, SES and comorbidities. Subgroup analyses and interaction models were used to assess differences among specific susceptible population subgroups.
Results
An IQR difference (10.1 ppb vs 4.2 ppb) in NO2 concentration was associated with a 3% (95% CI: -1%, 6%), 22% (95% CI:11%, 35%), and 5% (95% CI:1%, 8%) increase in annual total health care, ER and outpatient costs in the baseline model. Associations with black carbon showed similar patterns but were smaller in magnitude. Among those with cardiovascular diseases, an IQR increase in NO2 was associated with a 7% (95% CI: 1%, 13%) increase in total annual health care cost and 23% (95% CI: 17%, 29%) increase in ER costs.
Discussion
Higher long-term TRAP exposure was associated with higher direct annual health care cost in this elderly cohort. Those with existing cardiovascular disease had particularly strong associations between TRAP exposure and direct annual health care costs.},

abstract = {Air pollution may contribute to onset and progression of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Most studies have focused on the contribution of traffic-related exposure to PM10 or PM2.5. Our aim was to investigate the association of different components of industry-related air pollution on the occurrence of chronic diseases. A register-based repeated cross-sectional study was conducted among 89,714 subjects (2012) with 536,599 annual observations (2012–2017) living in the vicinity of a large industrial area in the Netherlands. Information from the dispensed medication registration was linked with a dispersion model to characterize annual individual-level exposure of all subjects at place of residence. Associations between annual exposure (concentration and duration) to particulate matter (PM10), nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and volatile organic compounds (VOC) with annual dispensed medication for cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory conditions were investigated by multivariate logistic regression analysis with generalized estimating equations (GEE) while controlling for confounders. Exposure to PM10 and to NOX (per $\mu$g/m3) were significantly associated with medication for cardiovascular diseases (OR 1.06, 95CI% 1.06–1.06 and OR 1.01, 95%CI 1.01–1.01 respectively). Exposures to PM10 and SO2 (per $\mu$g/m3) were significantly associated with medication for inflammatory conditions (OR 1.05, 95%CI 1.00–1.09 and OR 1.07, 95%CI 1.01–1.14 respectively). Exposure to SO2 was inversely associated with respiratory diseases (OR 0.91, 95%CI 0.86–0.97). Except for inflammatory conditions, exposure duration (years) was significantly associated with the other three chronic diseases (OR varying from 1.01 to 1.03). This study indicates that specific air pollution components caused by industry may contribute to the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory conditions.},

abstract = {Air pollution is one of the most serious environmental problems that afflict our planet and one of the greatest risk factors for human health. In particular, PM2.5 is able to cross the blood-alveolar and blood-brain barriers, thus increasing the onset of respiratory, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Neurodegenerative disease is a progressive neuronal dysfunction that leads to neuronal lesions in both structure and function, and includes several diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), vascular dementia (VaD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and others. We carried out a systematic review using PRISMA approach to investigate on the possible association between exposure to PM2.5 and neurodegenerative diseases. The international databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Sciences) were used to find published studies on the topic. The search period was between January 2011 and June 2021. About 2000 full research articles were selected, and finally, we included 20 full-research articles. Selected studies have highlighted how PM2.5 exposure can be associated with the onset of neurodegenerative diseases (AD, PD, MS, VaD). This association depends not only on age, PM2.5 levels and exposure time, but also on exposure to other air pollutants, proximity to areas with high vehicular traffic, and the presence of comorbidities. Exposure to PM2.5 promotes neuroinflammation processes, because through breathing the particles can reach the nasal epithelial mucosa and transferred to the brain through the olfactory bulb. Furthermore, exposure to PM2.5 has been associated with an increased expression of markers of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. alpha-synuclein or beta-amyloid), which can contribute to the etiopathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Although many studies have revealed the pathological relationship between PM2.5 exposure and cognitive impairment, the potential cellular and molecular mechanisms of PM2.5 leading to neurodegenerative disease remain not entirely clear, and then, further studies need to be carried out on the topic.},

Epidemiological evidence linking type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with air pollution is discrepant and most are restricted to the influences of air-pollutant mass concentration. This study aims to explore the effects of long-term exposure to air pollution and its metal constituents on T2DM prevalence in China.
Methods
We used data on 10,253 adult residents from the baseline survey of Wuhan Chronic Disease Cohort in 2019. Ambient PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 exposure were estimated at residences based on Chinese Air Quality Reanalysis Dataset. Concentrations of 10 metal constituents were measured by 976 PM2.5 filter samples collected from four monitoring stations. Logistic regression models were employed to examine associations of T2DM prevalence with 3-year mean concentrations of each air pollutant and PM2.5 metal constituents prior to the baseline investigation.
Results
A total of 673 T2DM cases (6.6%) were identified. The 3-year mean exposures to PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 were 50.89 $\mu$g/m3, 82.86 $\mu$g/m3, and 39.79 $\mu$g/m3, respectively. And interquartile range (IQR) of 10 metals in PM2.5 varied from 0.03 ng/m3 to 78.30 ng/m3. For 1 $\mu$g/m3 increment in PM2.5, PM10 and NO2, the odds of T2DM increased by 7.2% (95%CI: 1.026, 1.136), 3.1% (95%CI: 1.013, 1.050), and 2.1% (95%CI: 1.005, 1.038) after adjusting for potential confounders. Cd and Sb in PM2.5 were significant risk factors to T2DM with odds ratios of 1.350 (95%CI: 1.089, 1.673) and 1.389 (95%CI: 1.164, 1.658) for per IQR increase, respectively. Stratification analyses indicated that males and those aged ≥45 years were more susceptive to long-term air pollution.
Conclusions
Long-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 increased T2DM prevalence in a Wuhan population, especially for men and middle-aged and elderly people. Moreover, T2DM was significantly associated with Cd and Sb in PM2.5. Further research to validate these results and to clarify the underlying mechanisms is warranted.},

abstract = {Background
Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) is a critical risk factor and major contributor to respiratory and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The effects of TRAP beyond the lungs can be related to changes in circulatory proteins. However, such TRAP-mediated changes have not been defined in an unbiased manner using a controlled human model.
Objective
To detail global protein changes (the proteome) in plasma following exposure to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE), a paradigm of TRAP, using controlled human exposures.
Methods
In one protocol, ex-smokers and never-smokers were exposed to filtered air (FA) and DE (300 $\mu$g PM2.5/m3), on order-randomized days, for 2 h. In a second protocol, independent never-smoking participants were exposed to lower concentrations of DE (20, 50 or 150 $\mu$g PM2.5/m3) and FA, for 4 h, on order-randomized days. Each exposure was separated by 4 weeks of washout. Plasma samples obtained 24 h post-exposure from ex-smokers (n = 6) were first probed using Slow off-rate modified aptamer proteomic array. Plasma from never-smokers (n = 11) was used for independent assessment of proteins selected from the proteomics study by immunoblotting.
Results
Proteomics analyses revealed that DE significantly altered 342 proteins in plasma of ex-smokers (n = 6). The top 20 proteins therein were primarily associated with inflammation and CVD. Plasma from never-smokers (n = 11) was used for independent assessment of 6 proteins, amongst the top 10 proteins increased by DE in the proteomics study, for immunoblotting. The abundance of all six proteins (fractalkine, apolipoproteins (APOB and APOM), IL18R1, MIP-3 and MMP-12) was significantly increased by DE in plasma of these never-smokers. DE-mediated increase was shown to be concentration-dependent for fractalkine, APOB and MMP-12, all biomarkers of atherosclerosis, which correlated with plasma levels of IL-6, a subclinical marker of CVD, in independent participants.
Conclusion
This investigation details changes in the human plasma proteome due to TRAP. We identify specific atherosclerosis-related proteins that increase concentration-dependently across a range of TRAP levels applicable worldwide.},

This investigation has simulated the levels of air pollutants, namely, CO, NOx, PM2.5, and PM10 and reconciled them with actual air quality measurements in Nicosia, Cyprus, during a 9-month period at an hourly resolution. To this end, several scenarios and cases were formulated to tackle emissions and minimise human mortality risks in the city.
Methods
The GRAL dispersion model was used to project pollution levels. Nine different traffic scenarios were devised to estimate variations in concentration of PM2.5 and NOx under various policies, such as banning diesel passenger vehicles (PV), light duty vehicles (LDV), non-Euro 6 standards vehicles, stringent speed limits and a ubiquitous roll-out of electric passenger vehicles. Moreover, 4 distinct cases were analysed to year 2030 considering a fluctuation in traffic of ±20% whereas all vehicles conform to Euro 6 standards. Three additional policies examined the prohibition of diesel PV and LDV, 80% electric PV and outlawing fireplaces. Drawing on the findings of these scenarios and cases, the total cardiovascular and respiratory mortality rates at the capital of Cyprus, Nicosia, were deduced.
Results
The most promising scenario in terms of curbing emissions was to ban non-Euro 6 vehicles and diesel PV and LDV which could contain average NOx concentration, in Nicosia, from 52.9 $\mu$g/m3 to 15.0 $\mu$g/m3. If this policy were to be implemented, it could have saved 70% of the premature deaths tied to NOx emissions. For particulate matter, banning fireplaces and abandoning non-Euro 6 vehicles could lower average concentrations from 18.3 $\mu$g/m3 to 13.1 $\mu$g/m3, saving at least 30% of the people poised to lose their lives from particulate matter risks.
Conclusion
Traffic and residential heat policies are not easy to implement. However, our study has demonstrated that the most effective policies for curbing NOx emissions would be to ensure that all vehicles abide with the Euro 6 standards and, concurrently, ban diesel passenger and light duty vehicles. Lastly, phasing out domestic fireplaces appears to be the most promising solution for containing particulate matter, in 2030.},

abstract = {Sub-Saharan African countries, including Ghana, are known hotspots for fine particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) and stillbirths but lacked epidemiologic evidence. We investigated the association between PM2.5 and stillbirth in Ghana. District-level stillbirth data were obtained from the Ghana Health Service for all 260 local districts from 2012 to 2019 for a total of 5,229,338 births, including 81,611 stillbirths. Spatiotemporal datasets, including satellite-derived PM2.5, temperature, population density, and gross domestic product were linked with the birth data. We applied a variant difference-in-differences design with conditional quasi-Poisson regression to estimate the risk of stillbirth associated with annual PM2.5 concentrations. We adjusted for relevant environmental and sociodemographic factors and performed subgroup analyses by population density and household air pollution. The average district-level annual stillbirth incidence was 29 (standard deviation = 55) per 1000 births. The annual average PM2.5 concentration was 59.97 $\mu$g/m3 (standard deviation = 9.75). Every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increment in annual average PM2.5 was associated with a 3% risk of stillbirth (RR); 1.03 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.09) for all-source PM2.5 and 2% risk each for anthropogenic (RR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.07) and natural (RR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.11) sources. The association was higher for moderate or high subgroup, relative to low subgroup and higher in natural than anthropogenic sources of PM2.5 exposures. Thus, there was some evidence for an adverse association between PM2.5 exposure and stillbirth but estimates were less precise. Given that the district-level variation may be underpowered, stronger risk is expected in future high-quality individual-level longitudinal cohort studies in Ghana.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to outdoor air pollution is associated with adverse health effects. Previous studies have indicated higher levels of air pollution in socially deprived areas.
Aim
To investigate associations between air pollution and socio-demographic variables, comorbidity, stress, and green space at the residence in Denmark.
Methods
We included 2,237,346 persons living in Denmark, aged 35 years or older in 2017. We used the high resolution, multi-scale DEHM/UBM/AirGIS air pollution modelling system to calculate mean concentrations of air pollution with PM2.5, elemental carbon, ultrafine particles and NO2 at residences held the preceding five years. We used nationwide registries to retrieve information about socio-demographic indicators at the individual and neighborhood levels. We used general linear regression models to analyze associations between socio-demographic indicators and air pollution at the residence.
Results
Individuals with high SES (income, higher white-collar worker and high educational level) and of non-Danish origin were exposed to higher levels of air pollution than individuals of low SES and of Danish origin, respectively. We found comparable levels of air pollution according to sex, stress events and morbidity. For neighborhood level SES indicators, we found high air pollution levels in neighborhoods with low SES measured as proportion of social housing, sole providers, low income and unemployment. In contrast, we found higher air pollution levels in neighborhoods with higher educational level and a low proportion of manual labor. People living in an apartment and/or with little green space had higher air pollution levels.
Conclusion
In Denmark, high levels of residential air pollution were associated with higher individual SES and non-Danish origin. For neighborhood-level indicators of SES, no consistent pattern was observed. These results highlight the need for analyzing many different socio-demographic indicators to understand the complex associations between SES and exposure to air pollution.},

abstract = {Background and aim
Experimental studies show that short-term exposure to air pollution may alter cytokine concentrations. There is, however, a lack of epidemiological studies evaluating the association between long-term air pollution exposure and inflammation-related proteins in young children. Our objective was to examine whether air pollution exposure is associated with inflammation-related proteins during the first 2 years of life.
Methods
In a pooled analysis of two birth cohorts from Stockholm County (n = 158), plasma levels of 92 systemic inflammation-related proteins were measured by Olink Proseek Multiplex Inflammation panel at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years of age. Time-weighted average exposure to particles with an aerodynamic diameter of <10 $\mu$m (PM10), <2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) at residential addresses from birth and onwards was estimated via validated dispersion models. Stratified by sex, longitudinal cross-referenced mixed effect models were applied to estimate the overall effect of preceding air pollution exposure on combined protein levels, “inflammatory proteome”, over the first 2 years of life, followed by cross-sectional protein-specific bootstrapped quantile regression analysis.
Results
We identified significant longitudinal associations of inflammatory proteome during the first 2 years of life with preceding PM2.5 exposure, while consistent associations with PM10 and NO2 across ages were only observed among girls. Subsequent protein-specific analyses revealed significant associations of PM10 exposure with an increase in IFN-gamma and IL-12B in boys, and a decrease in IL-8 in girls at different percentiles of proteins levels, at age 6 months. Several inflammation-related proteins were also significantly associated with preceding PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 exposures, at ages 1 and 2 years, in a sex-specific manner.
Conclusions
Ambient air pollution exposure influences inflammation-related protein levels already during early childhood. Our results also suggest age- and sex-specific differences in the impact of air pollution on children's inflammatory profiles.},

abstract = {Distributive environmental justice research on children's exposure to vehicular pollution is underdeveloped and few empirical studies have been conducted in the US. This study seeks to address this gap by examining if socially disadvantaged children are disproportionately located in public school districts burdened by higher vehicular pollution in Texas—the second largest US state based on population size. Vehicular pollution exposure is measured using two variables: (1) an index developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency that combines traffic proximity and volume; and (2) outdoor concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a widely used proxy for traffic-related air pollution. These variables are linked to school district level data on socio-demographic characteristics of children obtained from the latest American Community Survey. Statistical analysis is based on multivariable generalized estimating equations that account for spatial clustering of school districts. Results reveal significantly greater traffic proximity and NO2 exposure in Texas school districts with higher percentages of children, after controlling for clustering, population density, and other socio-demographic factors. Districts exposed to higher levels of traffic proximity and NO2 exposure also contain significantly greater proportions of racial/ethnic minority, foreign-born, disabled, and socioeconomically vulnerable children. These findings highlight the urgent need to develop mitigation strategies for reducing vehicular pollution exposure, especially in districts with higher proportions of socially disadvantaged students that could be additionally burdened with limited resources. School districts represent a policy relevant analytic unit since school district boards can act as advocates for the environmental health of children and implement mitigation strategies for reducing pollution exposure.},

abstract = {Growing epidemiological evidence has shown that exposure to ambient air pollution contributes to poor sleep quality. However, whether variability in air pollution exposure affects sleep quality remains unclear. Based on a large sample in China, this study linked individual air pollutant exposure levels and temporal variability with subjective sleep quality. Town-level data on daily air pollution concentration for 30 days prior to the survey date were collected, and the monthly mean value, standard deviations, number of heavily polluted days, and trajectory for six common pollutants were calculated to measure air pollution exposure and its variations. Sleep quality was subjectively assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and a PSQI score above 5 indicated overall poor sleep quality. Multilevel and negative control models were used. Both air pollution exposure and variability contributed to poor sleep quality. A one-point increase in the one-month mean concentration of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters of ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) and ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10) led to 0.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.002–1.006) and 0.3% (95% CI: 1.001–1.004) increases in the likelihoods of overall poor sleep quality (PSQI score >5), respectively; the odds ratios of a heavy pollution day with PM2.5 and PM10 were 2.2% (95% CI: 1.012–1.032) and 2.2% (95% CI: 1.012–1.032), respectively. Although the mean concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide met the national standard, they contributed to the likelihood of overall poor sleep quality (PSQI score >5). A trajectory of air pollution exposure with maximum variability was associated with a higher likelihood of overall poor sleep quality (PSQI score >5). Subjective measures of sleep latency, duration, and efficiency (derived from PSQI) were affected in most cases. Thus, sleep health improvements should account for air pollution exposure and its variations in China under relatively high air pollution levels.},

abstract = {Household air pollution (HAP) arising from combustion of biomass fuel (BMF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in low-income countries. Air pollution may stimulate pro-inflammatory responses by activating diverse immune cells and cyto/chemokine expression, thereby contributing to diseases. We aimed to study cellular immune responses among women chronically exposed to HAP through use of BMF for domestic cooking. Among 200 healthy, non-smoking women in rural Bangladesh, we assessed exposure to HAP by measuring particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO), through use of personal monitors RTI MicroPEM™ and Lascar CO logger respectively, for 48 h. Blood samples were collected following HAP exposure assessment and were analyzed for immunoprofiling by flow cytometry, plasma IgE by immunoassay analyzer and cyto/chemokine response from monocyte-derived-macrophages (MDM) and -dendritic cells (MDDC) by multiplex immunoassay. In multivariate linear regression model, a doubling of PM2.5 was associated with small increments in immature/early B cells (CD19+CD38+) and plasmablasts (CD19+CD38+CD27+). In contrast, a doubling of CO was associated with 1.20% reduction in CD19+ B lymphocytes (95% confidence interval (CI) = -2.36, −0.01). A doubling of PM2.5 and BC each was associated with 3.12% (95%CI = −5.85, −0.38) and 4.07% (95%CI = −7.96, −0.17) decrements in memory B cells (CD19+CD27+), respectively. Exposure to CO was associated with increased plasma IgE levels (beta($\beta$) = 240.4, 95%CI = 3.06, 477.8). PM2.5 and CO exposure was associated with increased MDM production of CXCL10 ($\beta$ = 12287, 95%CI = 1038, 23536) and CCL5 ($\beta$ = 835.7, 95%CI = 95.5, 1576), respectively. Conversely, BC exposure was associated with reduction in MDDC-produced CCL5 ($\beta$ = −3583, 95%CI = −6358, −807.8) and TNF-$\alpha$ ($\beta$ = −15521, 95%CI = −28968, −2074). Our findings suggest that chronic HAP exposure through BMF use adversely affects proportions of B lymphocytes, particularly memory B cells, plasma IgE levels and functions of antigen presenting cells in rural women.},

abstract = {Background
Previous shreds of evidence have suggested that ambient air pollution is negatively associated with cognitive health among older adults, but whether indoor air pollutants such as cooking fuel, tobacco smoke, and incense burning exposure affect the cognitive score is unknown, especially in limited-resource areas.
Method
The study has utilized the recently released data from the Longitudinal Ageing Study of India (LASI), Wave 1, conducted from 2017 to 2018. A total of 63,883 (≥45 years) older adults were considered for the analysis. Descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis and ordinary least squares regression were employed in the study.
Results
The estimated mean cognitive score was 25.4 and the percentage of solid fuel users was 45.6 in India. The cognitive score gap between the two groups was more remarkable in Tamil Nadu (clean fuels: 29.7; solid fuels: 23.9). A significant cognitive score gap was observed for all indoor air pollutants, i.e., cooking fuel (clean: 29.7 and solid fuels: 23.9), exposure to tobacco smoke (not exposed: 25.7 and exposed: 24.4), and exposure to daily incense burning (not exposed: 25.9 and exposed: 24.8). The unadjusted model found that a one-unit increase of using charcoal/lignite/coal reduces the cognitive score by 5 (95% CI: −5.36, −4.61). A similar effect of exposure to tobacco smoke ($\beta$ = −0.79, 95% CI: −0.89, −0.68) and incense burning ($\beta$ = −0.28, 95% CI: −0.30, −0.26) was explored in the study. After adjusting socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, indoor air pollution was found to be a significant determinant of cognitive health.
Conclusions
The study has identified exposure to indoor air pollution as a risk factor for cognitive impairment among older adults. Therefore, we suggest an urgent need of promoting existing schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana and creating awareness about the adverse effects of indoor air pollutants for a better future.},

However, the contamination and sources of heavy metal(loid)s in household dust environments, as well as source identification of health risks related to heavy metal(loid)s from household dust for vulnerable populations such as children, have not been thoroughly studied in China, particularly for the areas involved with industrial activities such as ore mining. Thus, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a rural area famous for Pb/Zn ore mining, to assess the pollution sources and health risks of heavy metal(loid)s from household indoor and outdoor dust and to identify the contribution of household dust to the health risks for children. The results indicated that household environment was heavily contaminated by metal(loid)s, which were mainly attributed to mining activity. Meanwhile, the indoor/outdoor ratio and the redundancy analysis indicated that there were other pollution sources in indoor environments such as coal combustion, materials for interior building and decoration. Vapor inhalation was the main exposure pathway for Hg, while ingestion was the predominant pathway for other metal(loid)s. Although the cancer risks were relatively low, the HIt from household indoor and outdoor dust (2.19) was about twice the acceptable limit (1) and was primarily from Pb (64.52%) and As (23.42%). Outdoor dust was a larger contributor to the HI of Sb, As, Cr, Cd, Zn and Pb, which accounted for 51.37%, 58.63%, 52.14%, 59.66%, 52.87% and 64.47%, respectively, and the HIt was mainly from outdoor dust (60.76%). These results indicated that non-cancer health risks were largely from outdoor dust exposure, and strengthened the notion that concern should be given to the potential health risks from metal(loid)s in household dust both originating from mining activity and indoor environmental sources.},

abstract = {In epidemiological studies, assessment of long term exposure to air pollution is often estimated using air pollution measurements at fixed monitoring stations, and interpolated to the residence of survey participants through Geographical Information Systems (GIS). However, obtaining georeferenced address data from national registries requires a long and cumbersome administrative procedure, since this kind of personal data is protected by privacy regulations. This paper aims to assess whether information collected in health interview surveys, including air pollution annoyance, could be used to build prediction models for assessing individual long term exposure to air pollution, removing the need for data on personal residence address. Analyses were carried out based on data from the Belgian Health Interview Survey (BHIS) 2013 linked to GIS-modelled air pollution exposure at the residence place of participants older than 15 years (n = 9347). First, univariate linear regressions were performed to assess the relationship between air pollution annoyance and modelled exposure to each air pollutant. Secondly, a multivariable linear regression was performed for each air pollutant based on a set of variables selected with elastic net cross-validation, including variables related to environmental annoyance, socio-economic and health status of participants. Finally, the performance of the models to classify individuals in three levels of exposure was assessed by means of a confusion matrix. Our results suggest a limited validity of self-reported air pollution annoyance as a direct proxy for air pollution exposure and a weak contribution of environmental annoyance variables in prediction models. Models using variables related to the socio-economic status, region, urban level and environmental annoyance allow to predict individual air pollution exposure with a percentage of error ranging from 8% to 18%. Although these models do not provide very accurate predictions in terms of absolute exposure to air pollution, they do allow to classify individuals in groups of relative exposure levels, ranking participants from low over medium to high air pollution exposure. This model represents a rapid assessment tool to identify groups within the BHIS participants undergoing the highest levels of environmental stress.},

Therefore, we aimed to assess the relationship between particulate matter (PM) exposure and indicators of traffic with depressive symptoms in women of Sabzevar, Iran. This cross-sectional study was based on 741 women aged 15–45 years (adults) in 2019. The annual average of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 at home was estimated using land use regression (LUR) models. Street map of Sabzevar was used to calculate the indicators of traffic, i.e., the proximity to major roads and total street length buffers with 100, 300 and 500 m radii around the participants' homes. We used the Center for Epidemiological Studies- Depression (CESD-20) Scale in the general population to measure depression scores. Quasi-Poisson models and logistic regression were used to examine the association and odds ratios of exposure to air pollution and depression scores adjusted for relevant covariates. Exposure to PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 and total street length in 100 m buffer were significantly associated with higher depression scores. In fully adjusted model, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 concentration as well as total street length in 100 m buffer was associated with 1.25 (95% CI:1.03, 1.52, P-value = 0.02), 1.16 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.26, P-value< 0.01), 1.16 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.29, P-Value = 0.01) and 1.15 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.25, P-value< 0.01) odds of clinical depression, respectively. For street length in 300 and 500 m buffers and proximity to major roads, no statistically significant increased risk of clinical depression were observed. Overall, our findings recommended that air pollution exposure has increased the risk of clinical depression in women.},

Air pollutants (including H2S, CH4, and total suspended particles (TSP)) and noise levels were also sampled. In addition, we estimated the potential health risk assessment due to the exposure to hydrogen sulphide in the study areas. The findings have shown that 1) There is a statistical difference (p-value < 0.001) between the two exposed groups and far-exposed group regarding health risks and residents' perceptions; 2) Compared to the ST exposed group, the LS exposed group statistically showed a higher perception to bad odours and skin diseases; lower satisfaction with regards to the personal health condition and the operation of the landfill; and higher willingness to change current living locations; and 3) There is evidence to indicate that elevated concentrations of air pollutants are associated with the high self-reported health risks and residents' perceptions. Urgent actions should be focused on the LS exposed group, landfill and quarry operations to prevent further adverse health effects.},

abstract = {Emerging evidence witnesses the association of air pollution exposure with sleep disorders or the risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); however, the results are not consistent. OSA patients with or without a low arousal threshold (LAT) have different pathology and therapeutic schemes. No study has evaluated the potential diverse effects of air pollution on the phenotypes of OSA. The current study aimed to evaluate the associations of short-term and long-term exposure to air pollution with sleep-disordered measures and OSA phenotypes. This cross-sectional study consisted of 4634 participants from a sleep center in Taipei from January 2015 to April 2019. The personal exposure to ambient PM2.5 and NO2 was assessed by a spatial-temporal model. Overnight polysomnography was used to measure the sleep parameters. According to a developed clinical tool, we defined the low arousal threshold (LAT) and identified the OSA patients with or without LAT. We applied a generalized linear model and multinomial logistic regression model to estimate the change of sleep measures and risk of the OSA phenotypes, respectively, associated with an interquartile range (IQR) increment of personal pollution exposure after adjusting for the essential confounders. In the single-pollutant model, we observed the associations of NO2 with sleep-disordered measures by decreasing the total sleep time, sleep efficiency, extending the time of wake after sleep onset, and the association of NO2 with the increased risk of LAT OSA by around 15%. The two-pollutant model with both long-term and short-term exposures confirmed the most robust associations of long-term NO2 exposure with sleep measures. An IQR increment of NO2 averaged over the past year (6.0 ppb) decreased 3.32 min of total sleep time and 0.85% of sleep efficiency. Mitigating exposure to air pollution may improve sleep quality and reduce the risk of LAT OSA.},

abstract = {Long-term exposure to air pollution and systemic inflammation are associated with increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS); however, their joint effects in Chinese middle-aged and older adults is unknown. In this cross-sectional study, 11,838 residents aged 45 years and older from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) Wave 3 in 2015 were included. MetS was diagnosed using the Joint Interim Societies' definition. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was assessed to reflect systemic inflammation. Individual exposure to air pollutants (particulate matter with a diameter ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) or ≤ 10 $\mu$m (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO)) was evaluated using satellite-based spatiotemporal models according to participant residence at county-level. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were applied to examine the association between air pollution and MetS, and the modification effects of CRP between air pollution and MetS were estimated using interaction terms of CRP and air pollutants in the GLM models. The prevalence of MetS was 32.37%. The adjusted odd ratio (OR) of MetS was 1.192 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.116, 1.272), 1.177 (95% CI: 1.103, 1.255), 1.158 (95% CI: 1.072, 1.252), 1.303 (95% CI: 1.211,1.403), 1.107 (95% CI: 1.046, 1.171) and 1.156 (95% CI:1.083, 1.234), per inter-quartile range increase in PM2.5 (24.04 $\mu$g/m3), PM10 (39.00 $\mu$g/m3), SO2 (19.05 $\mu$g/m3), NO2 (11.28 $\mu$g/m3), O3 (9.51 $\mu$g/m3) and CO (0.46 mg/m3), respectively. CRP was also associated with increased prevalence of MetS (OR = 1.049, 95% CI: 1.035, 1.064; per 1.90 mg/L increase in CRP). Interaction analysis suggested that high CRP levels enhanced the association between air pollution exposure and MetS. Long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with increased prevalence of MetS, which might be enhanced by systemic inflammation. Given the rapidly aging society and heavy burden of MetS, measures should be taken to improve air quality and reduce systemic inflammation.},

A generalized additive model (GAM) was applied, and stratified analyses were performed to investigate the potential modifying effects by age, gender, and season. Meanwhile, the disease burden was revealed from attributable risk. Positive associations between short-term NO2 and daily T2DM outpatient visits were observed. The strongest association was observed at lag 04, with per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase of NO2 corresponded to increased T2DM outpatient visits at 1.57% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48%, 2.65%]. Stronger associations were presented in middle-aged group (35–64 years old), male group, and cool seasons (October to March). Moreover, there were 1.553% (8664.535 cases) of T2DM outpatient visits attributable to NO2. Middle-aged adults, males, and patients who visited in cool seasons suffered heavier burdens. Conclusively, short-term exposure to NO2 was associated with increased outpatient visits for T2DM. Attention should be paid to the impact of NO2 on the burden of T2DM, especially for those vulnerable groups.},

A series of policies and regulations has led to appreciable traffic emission reductions in recent decades. To shed light on long-term (2014–2020) roadside air pollution and assess the efficacy of traffic control measures and their effects on public health, this study quantitatively evaluated changes in the concentrations of six key air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO and O3) measured at 5 roadside and 12 urban background monitoring stations in Beijing. We found that the annual mean concentrations of these air pollutants were remarkably reduced by 47%–71% from 2014 to 2020, while the concurrent ozone concentration increased by 17.4%. In addition, we observed reductions in the roadside increments in PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and CO of 54.8%, 29.8%, 20.6%, and 59.1%, respectively, indicating the high effectiveness of new vehicle standard (China V and VI) implementation in Beijing. The premature deaths due to traffic emissions were estimated to be 8379 and 1908 cases in 2014 and 2020, respectively. The impact of NO2 from road traffic relative to PM2.5 on premature mortality was comparable to that of traffic-related PM2.5 emissions. The public health effect of SO2 originating from traffic was markedly lower than that of PM2.5. The results indicated that a reduction in traffic-related NO2 could likely yield the greatest benefits for public health.},

In the present study, total suspended particles (TSP) and fine PM (PM2.5) were collected between 2015 and 2018. Then, OP and OB related to PM exposure at this industrial complex neighborhood were determined, using methods which measure the oxidation of lung antioxidants, glutathione (GHS), and ascorbic acid (AA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. TSP samples (2015 mean = 49 ± 21 $\mu$g m−3) showed higher concentrations than PM2.5 (2018 mean = 32 ± 18 $\mu$g m−3). PM2.5 campaigns presented high OP and OB for ascorbate (AA), and glutathione (GSH), while OP and OB for dithiothreitol (DTT) was higher in TSP. There were associations between OPAA and PM, for both TSP and PM2.5. However, no positive associations were found between PM and OBGSH and OBDTT indicating that in this context PM concentration did not necessarily reflect the health risk of exposure. The air masses trajectories indicated influences from industrial, vehicular emissions over the years. In conclusion, OP results may reveal critical health risks better than PM mass at this industrial complex region.},

abstract = {Background
Evidence for the metabolic impact of long-term exposure to air pollution on diabetes is lacking. We investigated the association of particulate matter <10 $\mu$m (PM10) and <2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) with yearly averages of HbA1c, daily insulin dose (IU/kg) and rates of severe hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetes (T1D).
Methods
We studied data of 44,383 individuals with T1D < 21 years which were documented in 377 German centres within the diabetes prospective follow-up registry (DPV) between 2009 and 2018. Outcomes were aggregated by year and by patient. PM10-and PM2.5-yearly averages prior to the respective treatment year were linked to individuals via the five-digit postcode areas of residency. Repeated measures linear and negative binomial regression were used to study the association between PM-quartiles (Q1 lowest, Q4 highest concentration) and yearly averages of HbA1c, daily insulin dose and rates of severe hypoglycaemia (confounders: sex, time-dependent age, age at diabetes onset, time-dependent type of treatment, migratory background, degree of urbanisation and socioeconomic index of deprivation).
Results
Adjusted mean HbA1c increased with PM10 (Q1: 7.96% [95%-CI: 7.95–7.98], Q4: 8.03% [8.02–8.05], p-value<0.001) and with PM2.5 (Q1: 7.97% [7.95–7.99], Q4: 8.02% [8.01–8.04], p < 0.001). Changes in daily insulin dose were inversely related to PM (PM10 and PM2.5: Q1 0.85 IU/kg [0.84–0.85], Q4: 0.83 IU/kg [0.82–0.83], p < 0.001). Adjusted rates of severe hypoglycaemia increased with PM-quartile groups (PM10 Q1:11.2 events/100 PY [10.9–11.5], PM10 Q4: 15.3 [14.9–15.7], p < 0.001; PM2.5 Q1: 9.9 events/100 PY [9.6–10.2], PM2.5 Q4: 14.2 [13.9–14.6], p < 0.001).
Discussion
Air pollution was associated with higher HbA1c levels and increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia in people with T1D, consequently indicating a higher risk of diabetes complications. Further studies are needed to explore causal pathways of the observed associations.},

abstract = {Introduction
Epidemiological evidence suggests associations between long-term exposure to air pollution and accelerated cognitive decline. China implemented a strict clean air action plan in 2013; however, it is unclear whether the improvement of air quality has alleviated cognitive impairment in the population.
Methods
From the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, 8536 Chinese adults were enrolled in 2011 and followed up in 2015. Satellite-based spatiotemporal models were used to estimate exposure to air pollutants (including particles with diameters ≤1.0 $\mu$m [PM1], ≤2.5 $\mu$m [PM2.5], ≤10 $\mu$m [PM10], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], and ozone [O3]). Cognitive function was evaluated using a structured questionnaire in three dimensions: episodic memory, orientation and attention, and visuoconstruction. The associations between changes in the levels of air pollutants and cognitive function were elucidated by a logistic model. The Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) model was applied to evaluate the cumulative effect of air pollutants.
Results
The mean (standard deviation) age of all participants was 58.6 (8.7) years. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) between the highest and the lowest quartile of PM1 exposure reduction for cognitive impairment was 0.46 (0.41, 0.53) after adjusting for confounders. Similar protective effects of cognitive function were observed with the decrease in the level of PM2.5 (0.34 [0.30, 0.39]), PM10 (0.54 [0.48, 0.62]), and NO2 (0.59 [0.51, 0.67]), while the reduction in O3 appeared to be less related to changes in cognitive function (OR: 0.97 [0.85, 1.10]). The protective association of PM1 reduction was stronger in males than in females. Decreased in PM2.5 dominate the cognitive function benefit relative to PM1, PM10, NO2.
Conclusions
The implementation of the clean air action plan led to a significant reduction in PM1, PM2.5, PM10, and NO2, which could slow the decline of cognitive function, while a reduction in O3 may not.},

Urinary CC16 (U-CC16) can be a noninvasive alternative, albeit requiring adequate adjustment for renal handling. Moreover, the SNP CC16 G38A influences CC16 levels. This study aimed to monitor the effect of short-term PM exposure on CC16 levels, measured noninvasively in schoolchildren, using an integrative approach. We used a selection of urine and buccal DNA samples from 86 children stored in an existing biobank. Using a multiple reaction monitoring method, we measured U-CC16, as well as RBP4 (retinol binding protein 4) and $\beta$2M (beta-2-microglobulin), required for adjustment. Buccal DNA samples were used for CC16 G38A genotyping. Linear mixed-effects models were used to find relevant associations between U-CC16 and previously obtained data from recent daily PM ≤ 2.5 or 10 $\mu$m exposure (PM2.5, PM10) modeled at the child's residence. Our study showed that exposure to low PM at the child's residence (median levels 18.9 $\mu$g/m³ (PM2.5) and 23.6 $\mu$g/m³ (PM10)) one day before sampling had an effect on the covariates-adjusted U-CC16 levels. This effect was dependent on the CC16 G38A genotype, due to its strong interaction with the association between PM levels and covariates-adjusted U-CC16 (P = 0.024 (PM2.5); P = 0.061 (PM10)). Only children carrying the 38GG genotype showed an increase of covariates-adjusted U-CC16, measured 24h after exposure, with increasing PM2.5 and PM10 ($\beta$ = 0.332; 95% CI: 0.110 to 0.554 and $\beta$ = 0.372; 95% CI: 0.101 to 0.643, respectively). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using an integrative approach to investigate short-term PM exposure of children, using urine to detect early signs of pulmonary damage, and taking into account important determinants such as the genetic background and adequate adjustment of the measured biomarker in urine.},

As (87%), Cr (87%), and Hg (99%) were predominantly found in residual fraction (F4), whereas Cd was predominantly found in water soluble and exchangeable fraction (F1 34%) and carbonate, oxidizable and reducible fraction (F2 27%). The first two chemical fractions of the trace metals were closely correlated with their bioaccessibilities. The carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks of exposure to trace metals in park dust were assessed using inhalation bioaccessibility and ingestion bioaccessibility. The hazard indexes of all investigated trace metals were below the safe level of 1. The carcinogenic risks of As, Ni, Cd and Cr were also below the acceptable level (10−6), indicating that there was no non-carcinogenic or carcinogenic risk from trace metals in the park dust.},

abstract = {While the health impacts of larger particulate matter, such as PM10 and PM2.5, have been studied extensively, research regarding ultrafine particles (UFPs or PM0.1) and particle surface area concentration (PSC) is lacking. This case-crossover study assessed the associations between exposure to PSC and UFP number concentration (UFPnc) and hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in New York State (NYS), 2013–2018. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design to compare the PSC and UFPnc levels between hospitalization days and control days (similar days without admissions) for each CVD case. We utilized NYS hospital discharge data to identify all CVD cases who resided in NYS. UFP simulation data from GEOS-Chem-APM, a state-of-the-art chemical transport model, was used to define PSC and UFPnc. Using a multi-pollutant model and conditional logistic regression, we assessed excess risk (ER)% per inter-quartile change of PSC and UFPnc after controlling for meteorological factors, co-pollutants, and time-varying variables. We found immediate and lasting associations between PSC and overall CVDs (lag0–lag0-6: ERs% (95% CI%) ranges: 0.4 (0.1,0.7) - 0.9 (0.7–1.2), and delayed and prolonged ERs%: 0.1–0.3 (95% CIs: 0.1–0.5) between UFPnc and CVDs (lag0-3–lag0-6). Exposure to larger PSC was associated with immediate ER increases in stroke, hypertension, and ischemic heart diseases (1.1%, 0.7%, 0.8%, respectively, all p < 0.05). The adverse effects of PSC on CVDs were highest among children (5–17 years old), in the fall and winter, and during cold temperatures. In conclusion, we found an immediate, lasting effects of PSC on overall CVDs and a delayed, prolonged impact of UFPnc. PSC was a more sensitive indicator than UFPnc. The PSC effects were higher among certain CVD subtypes, in children, in certain seasons, and during cold days. Further studies are needed to validate our findings and evaluate the long-term effects.},

abstract = {Although environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure is considered to be a severe public health problem and a modifiable risk factor for preterm birth (PTB), we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the PTB risk associated with trimester-specific prenatal ETS exposure. This study aimed to examine the accumulation of risk across trimester ETS exposure and the critical window of the association between maternal ETS exposure during pregnancy and PTB. A total of 63,038 mother-child pairs were involved in the analysis of the 2017 survey of Longhua Child Cohort Study. Information about socio-demographic characteristics, prenatal ETS exposure, and birth outcomes were collected using a self-report questionnaire. A series of logistic regression models were employed to assess the associations between prenatal ETS exposure and PTB. We found that maternal ETS exposure during pregnancy significantly increased the risk of PTB and this association increased with both the average level of daily ETS exposure and the number of trimesters of ETS exposure. Moreover, mothers who were initially exposed to ETS in the 1st trimester of pregnancy had significant higher risk of PTB (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.25–1.44). Furthermore, mothers exposed to ETS in the 1st trimester only (OR = 1.26, 95%CI: 1.04–1.50), in both 1st and 2nd trimester (OR = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.08–1.67) and throughout pregnancy (OR = 1.35, 95%CI: 1.24–1.46) experienced a significantly high risk of PTB. Prenatal maternal ETS exposure during only the 2nd trimester also resulted in a high risk of PTB with marginal significance (OR = 1.33, 95% CI:0.78–2.13). To conclude, the 1st and early 2nd trimester might be the critical window for prenatal ETS exposure causing PTB.},

abstract = {While associations between short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and risk of hospitalization are well documented and evidence suggests that such associations change over time, it is unclear whether these temporal changes exist in understudied less-urban areas or differ by sub-population. We analyzed daily time-series data of 968 continental U.S. counties for 2000–2016, with cause-specific hospitalization from Medicare claims and population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations originally estimated at 1km × 1 km from a hybrid model. Circulatory and respiratory hospitalizations were categorized based on primary diagnosis codes at discharge. Using modified Bayesian hierarchical modelling, we evaluated the temporal trend in association between PM2.5 and hospitalizations and whether disparities in this trend exist across individual-level characteristics (e.g., sex, age, race, and Medicaid eligibility as a proxy for socio-economic status) and urbanicity. Urbanicity was categorized into three levels by county-specific percentage of urban population based on urban rural delineation from the U.S. Census. In this cohort with understudied less-urban areas without regulatory monitors, we still found positive association between circulatory and respiratory hospitalization and short-term exposure to PM2.5, with higher effect estimates towards the end of study period. Consistent with current literature, we identified significant disparity in associations by race, socioeconomic status and urbanicity. We found that the percentage change in circulatory hospitalization rate per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 was higher in the 2008–2016 time period compared to the 2000–2007 period by 0.33% (95% posterior credible interval 0.22, 0.44%), 0.52% (0.33, 0.69%), and 0.67% (0.53, 0.83%) for low, medium and high tertiles of urban areas, respectively. We also observed significant differences in temporal trends of associations across socioeconomic status, sex, and age, indicating a possible widening in disparity of PM2.5-related health burden. This study raises the importance of considering environmental justice issues in PM2.5-related health impacts with respect to how associations may change over time.},

abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease characterized by inflammation and impaired tissue regeneration, and is reported as the fourth leading cause of death worldwide by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Environmental pollution and specifically motor vehicle emissions are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD, but little is still known about the molecular mechanisms that are altered following diesel exhaust particles (DEP) exposure. Here we used lung organoids derived from co-culture of alveolar epithelial progenitors and fibroblasts to investigate the effect of DEP on the epithelial-mesenchymal signaling niche in the distal lung, which is essential for tissue repair. We found that DEP treatment impaired the number as well as the average diameter of both airway and alveolar type of lung organoids. Bulk RNA-sequencing of re-sorted epithelial cells and fibroblasts following organoid co-culture shows that the Nrf2 pathway, which regulates antioxidants' activity, was upregulated in both cell populations in response to DEP; and WNT/$\beta$-catenin signaling, which is essential to promote epithelial repair, was downregulated in DEP-exposed epithelial cells. We show that pharmacological treatment with anti-oxidant agents such as N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or Mitoquinone mesylate (MitoQ) reversed the effect of DEP on organoids growth. Additionally, a WNT/$\beta$-catenin activator (CHIR99021) successfully restored WNT signaling and promoted organoid growth upon DEP exposure. We propose that targeting oxidative stress and specific signaling pathways affected by DEP in the distal lung may represent a strategy to restore tissue repair in COPD.},

abstract = {Air pollution and extreme heat have been responsible for more than a million deaths in China every year, especially in densely urbanized regions. While previous studies intensively evaluated air pollution episodes and extreme heat events, a limited number of studies comprehensively assessed atmospheric hot-and-polluted-episodes (HPE) – an episode with simultaneously high levels of air pollution and temperature – which have potential adverse synergic impacts on human health. This study focused on the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China due to its high temperature in summer and poor air quality throughout a year. We employed geostatistical downscaling to model meteorology at a spatial resolution of 1 km, and applied a machine learning algorithm (XGBoost) to estimate a high-resolution (1 km) daily concentration of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) for June to October over 20 years (2000–2019). Our results indicate an increasing trend (∼50%) in the frequency of HPE occurrence in the first decade (2000–2010). Conversely, the annual frequency of HPE occurrence reduced (16.7%), but its intensity increased during the second decade (2010–2019). The northern cities in the PRD region had higher levels of PM2.5 and O3 than their southern counterparts. During HPEs, regional daily PM2.5 exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) and Chinese guideline levels by 75% and 25%, respectively, while the O3 exceeded the WHO O3 standard by up to 69%. Overall, 567,063 (95% confidence interval (CI): 510,357–623,770) and 52,231 (95%CI: 26,116–78,346) excessive deaths were respectively attributable to exposure to PM2.5 and O3 in the PRD region. Our findings imply the necessity and urgency to formulate co-benefit policies to mitigate the region's air pollution and heat problems.},

abstract = {Background
Evidence on the associations between long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants (including particle with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10), particle with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2)) and prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) remains inconclusive. This study aimed to determine the associations based on a case-control study nested in the Wuhan Chronic Disease Cohort study (WCDCS), a population-based study with baseline survey in 2019.
Methods
A total of 10,253 residents living in Wuhan were recruited. The 3-year average concentrations of main pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, O3, NO2, and SO2) at residences prior to the survey date were estimated to evaluate the long-term exposures. The generalized linear mixed models were used to investigate the changes in MetS prevalence by an IQR increases in each air pollutant exposure concentrations. Interaction effects between air pollutants and demographic, lifestyle, and dietary factors on MetS were evaluated by including an interactive item in the main model.
Results
The prevalence of MetS in Wuhan was 9.8%, and the 3-year exposure concentrations of PM10, PM2.5, O3, NO2, and SO2 were 84.1 $\mu$g/m3, 50.5 $\mu$g/m3, 55.7 $\mu$g/m3, 46.0 $\mu$g/m3, and 9.4 $\mu$g/m3, respectively. Higher PM10, PM2.5 and O3 exposure concentrations were associated with an elevated MetS prevalence (e.g. an IQR increase in PM2.5, OR = 1.193, 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs): 1.028, 1.385; for O3, OR = 1.074, 95%CIs: 1.025, 1.124), whereas NO2, and SO2 were negatively or insignificant correlated with odds of Mets (e.g. an IQR increase in NO2, OR = 0.865, 95%CIs: 0.795, 0.941). Males, smokers, alcohol drinkers and individuals who intake fruits occasionally exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 were found had a higher risk of developing MetS.
Conclusions
Long-term exposure to higher concentrations of ambient air pollutants may elevate the prevalence of MetS in populations in Central China. Susceptible individuals especially those with unhealthy lifestyles had a higher risk for MetS.},

Thus, an accurate assessment of the spatial distribution of these losses is crucial for delineating priority areas for air pollution control in China. In this study, we assessed the PM2.5 exposure-related health effects according to the integrated exposure risk function and non-linear power law (NLP) function in 338 prefecture-level cities in China by utilizing online monitoring data and the PM2.5 Hindcast Database (PHD). Our results revealed no significant difference between the monitoring data and PHD (p value = 0.66 > 0.05). The number of deaths caused by PM2.5-related Stroke (cerebrovascular disease), ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer at the national level estimated through the NLP function was 0.27 million (95% CI: 0.06–0.50), 0.23 million (95% CI: 0.08–0.38), 0.31 million (95% CI: 0.04–0.57), and 0.31 million (95% CI: 0.16–0.40), respectively. The total economic cost at the national level in 2016 was approximately US80.25 billion (95% CI: 24.46–132.25). Based on a comparison of Z statistics, we propose that the evaluation results obtained using the NLP function and monitoring data are accurate. Additionally, according to scenario simulations, Beijing, Chongqing, Tianjin, and other cities should be priority areas for PM2.5 pollution control to achieve considerable health benefits. Our statistics can help improve the accuracy of PM2.5-related health effect assessments in China.},

However, very few studies have investigated the potential health effects of coexposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) and bioaerosols through the transmission of infectious agents, particularly under the current circumstances of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. In this study, we aimed to identify urinary metabolite biomarkers that might serve as clinically predictive or diagnostic standards for relevant diseases in a real-time manner. We performed an unbiased gas/liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC/LC-MS) approach to detect urinary metabolites in 92 samples from young healthy individuals collected at three different time points after exposure to clean air, polluted ambient, or purified air, as well as two additional time points after air repollution or repurification. Subsequently, we compared the metabolomic profiles between the two time points using an integrated analysis, along with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes-enriched pathway and time-series analysis. We identified 33 and 155 differential metabolites (DMs) associated with PM and bioaerosol exposure using GC/LC-MS and follow-up analyses, respectively. Our findings suggest that 16-dehydroprogesterone and 4-hydroxyphenylethanol in urine samples may serve as potential biomarkers to predict or diagnose PM- or bioaerosol-related diseases, respectively. The results indicated apparent differences between PM- and bioaerosol-associated DMs at five different time points and revealed dynamic alterations in the urinary metabolic profiles of young healthy humans with cyclic exposure to clean and polluted air environments. Our findings will help in investigating the detrimental health effects of short-term coexposure to airborne PM and bioaerosols in a real-time manner and improve clinically predictive or diagnostic strategies for preventing air pollution-related diseases.},

abstract = {Air pollution has been identified as one of the main environmental risks to health. Since exercise training seems to act as an anti-inflammatory modulator, our hypothesis is that exercise training prevents damage to respiratory and cardiovascular function caused by diesel exhaust particle (DEP) exposure. This study aimed to evaluate whether aerobic exercise training prior to DEP exposure prevents inflammatory processes in the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems. Therefore, BALB/C male mice were or were not submitted to a 10-week exercise training protocol (5×/week, 1 h/d), and after four weeks, they were exposed to DEP in a chamber with 24 $\mu$g/m3 PM2.5 or filtered air. Heart rate variability, lung mechanics and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, cytokines and polymorphonuclear cells in the lung parenchyma were evaluated. Exposure to DEPs reduced heart rate variability and the elastance of the respiratory system and increased the number of cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as well as macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes, the density of polymorphonuclear cells and the proportion of collagen fibres in the lung parenchyma. Additionally, DEP-exposed animals showed increased expression of IL-23 and IL-12p40 (proinflammatory cytokines) and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Exercise training avoided the increases in all these inflammatory parameters, except the elastance of the respiratory system, the amount of collagen fibres and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Additionally, trained animals showed increased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1ra. Although our data showed a reduction in proinflammatory markers and an increase in markers of the anti-inflammatory pathway, these changes were not sufficient to prevent damage to the lung and cardiovascular function induced by DEPs. Based on these data, we propose that aerobic exercise training prevents the lung inflammatory process induced by DEPs, although it was not sufficient to avoid chronic damage, such as a loss of lung function or cardiovascular events.},

abstract = {Background
Since 1971, the annual National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has remained at 53 ppb, the impact of long-term NO2 exposure on mortality is poorly understood.
Objectives
We examined associations between long-term NO2 exposure (12-month moving average of NO2) below the annual NAAQS and cause-specific mortality among the older adults in the U.S.
Methods
Cox proportional-hazard models were used to estimate Hazard Ratio (HR) for cause-specific mortality associated with long-term NO2 exposures among about 50 million Medicare beneficiaries living within the conterminous U.S. from 2001 to 2008.
Results
A 10 ppb increase in NO2 was associated with increased mortality from all-cause (HR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.05–1.06), cardiovascular (HR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.10–1.11), respiratory disease (HR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.08–1.11), and cancer (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00–1.02) adjusting for age, sex, race, ZIP code as strata ZIP code- and state-level socio-economic status (SES) as covariates, and PM2.5 exposure using a 2-stage approach. NO2 was also associated with elevated mortality from ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, and lung cancer. We found no evidence of a threshold, with positive and significant HRs across the range of NO2 exposures for all causes of death examined. Exposure-response curves were linear for all-cause, supra-linear for cardiovascular-, and sub-linear for respiratory-related mortality. HRs were highest consistently among Black beneficiaries.
Conclusions
Long-term NO2 exposure is associated with elevated risks of death by multiple causes, without evidence of a threshold response. Our findings raise concerns about the sufficiency of the annual NAAQS for NO2.},

abstract = {Background
Health effects associated with extreme temperature and elevated air pollutants have been concerns. The present study examined mortality from and morbidity of chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with extreme temperature and exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) by sex and age in 2005–2016 in metropolitans of Taiwan.
Methods
The distributed lag non-linear model was applied to analyze roles of extreme high (99th percentile) and low (5th percentile) temperatures, and 90th percentile PM2.5 and ozone (O3) in association with CKD risks of deaths, emergency room visits (ERVs), and outpatient visits by age (40–64 and 65 years and above) and sex. Pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all studied areas were estimated using random-effects meta-analysis.
Results
Cold spells (<14 °C) showed a higher risk on mortality from CKD for the elderly. Middle-aged population was more vulnerable to high temperature (31.3 °C) with the highest risk for women admitted to outpatient visits [RR = 1.25; (95% CI; 1.17–1.34)]. Women aged 65 years and above had the highest risk after exposing to higher levels of PM2.5 (55 $\mu$g/m3) [RR = 1.07; (95% CI; 1.03–1.12)] and O3 (43 ppb) [RR = 1.07; (95% CI; 1.00–1.15)].
Conclusions
The elderly CKD patients were more prone to the adverse effect of low temperature and high levels of PM2.5 and O3. Middle aged groups were more prone to health risks related to the high temperature. Men are more susceptible to the high temperature, meanwhile women are sensitive to higher levels of PM2.5 and O3.},

abstract = {Air pollution exposure positively correlates with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates, mainly due to myocardial infarction (MI). Herein, we aimed to study the metabolic mechanisms underlying this association, focusing on the evaluation of cardiac mitochondrial function and dynamics, together with its impact over MI progression. An initial time course study was performed in BALB/c mice breathing filtered air (FA) or urban air (UA) in whole-body exposure chambers located in Buenos Aires City downtown for up to 16 weeks (n = 8 per group and time point). After 12 weeks, lung inflammatory cell recruitment was evident in UA-exposed mice. Interestingly, impaired redox metabolism, characterized by decreased lung SOD activity and increased GSSG levels and NOX activity, precede local inflammation in this group. At this selected time point, additional mice were exposed to FA or UA (n = 12 per group) and alveolar macrophage PM uptake and nitric oxide (NO) production was observed in UA-exposed mice, together with increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-6) in BAL and plasma. Consequently, impaired heart tissue oxygen metabolism and altered mitochondrial ultrastructure and function were observed in UA-exposed mice after 12 weeks, characterized by decreased active state respiration and ATP production rates, and enhanced mitochondrial H2O2 production. Moreover, disturbed cardiac mitochondrial dynamics was detected in this group. This scenario led to a significant increase in the area of infarcted tissue following myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury in vivo, from 43 ± 3% of the area at risk in mice breathing FA to 66 ± 4% in UA-exposed mice (n = 6 per group, p < 0.01), together with a sustained increase in LVEDP during myocardial reperfusion. Taken together, our data unravel cardiac mitochondrial mechanisms that contribute to the understanding of the adverse health effects of urban air pollution exposure, and ultimately highlight the importance of considering environmental factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases.},

abstract = {A full-scale school ventilation performance test-bed is newly constructed to evaluate the effects of internal airflow on IAQ and cross-infection among students. The indoor airflow is controlled by return diffusers installed on the ceiling or the floor of a classroom. The removal performance of PM2.5 is measured according to the location of return diffusers in the school classroom, and the indoor airflow is analyzed using numerical simulation. The airflow angle is introduced to evaluate the possibility of cross-infection of infectious diseases between students at the height of their respiratory line. It is confirmed that the floor return is successfully reduced compared to the upper return at the height of the students' breathing line in the horizontal airflow, which has a high possibility of infection between students. The floor return reduces the dust removal time by 35% from the ‘Unhealthy' level to the ‘Good' level for PM2.5 compared to the upper return, which is due to the optimal control of airflow inside the classrooms. Through a study on the optimization of the direction of indoor airflow in school classrooms, this paper can provide a basic design guide for the direction of airflow that can improve classroom air quality, which can improve students' right to learn, and reduce cross-infection between students due to infectious diseases.},

abstract = {Ambient PM2.5 (fine particulate matter) pollution in China has been greatly reduced in recent years, especially since the implementation of the Clean Air Action in 2013. The analysis of variations in the pollution-related health burden and its driving factors has important implications for policy makers in terms of further improving the health benefits associated with air pollution control. Here, the Global Estimates Mortality Model was adopted to newly estimate the annual mortality attributable to PM2.5 in China from 2004 to 2017. Then, the effects of the changed ambient PM2.5 concentrations, population size and migration, aging and baseline mortality rate on the total variation of the PM2.5 health burden were quantified, and insights were provided into the factors impeding the achievement of health benefits as air pollution is mitigated. Our modelling results showed that the national PM2.5 health burden generally increased from 2.22 million (95% confidence interval: 1.39–2.98) in 2004 to 2.45 million (1.72–3.13) in 2017 with a tendency to rise first and then decline, and peaking at 2.65 million (1.60–3.60) in 2013. The average exposure to ambient PM2.5 in China has dropped since 2011, two years earlier than the overall PM2.5-attributable mortality turning point. Compared to 2013, the mitigation of PM2.5 pollution would have prevented 0.85 million deaths in 2017, at the same time, the effect of the population aging determined the addition of 0.51 million deaths from air pollution, which partly masked the effect of the mitigation. For future air pollution control policies to alleviate the public health burdens in the fast-growing Chinese cities, attention should be focused on old age care, especially in areas where PM2.5-attributable mortality may increase.},

abstract = {The olfactory nuisance, due to the emissions of active molecules, is mainly associated with unproperly managed waste disposal and animal farming. Volatile compounds e.g., aromatics, organic and inorganic sulfide compounds, as well as nitrogen and halogenated compounds are the major contributor to odor pollution generated by waste management plants; the most important source of atmospheric ammonia is produced by livestock farming. Although an odorous compound may represent a nuisance rather than a health risk, long-term exposure to a mixture of volatile compounds may represent a risk for different diseases, including asthma, atopic dermatitis, and neurologic damage. Workers and communities living close to odor-producing facilities result directly exposed to irritant air pollutants through inhalation and for this reason the cumulative health risk assessment is recommended. Health effects are related to the concentration and exposure duration to the odorants, as well as to their irritant potency and/or biotransformation in hazardous metabolites. The health effects of a single chemical are well known, while the interactions between molecules with different functional groups have still to be extensively studied. Odor emissions are often due to airborne pollutants at levels below the established toxicity thresholds. The relationship between odor and toxicity does not always occurs but depends on the specific kind of pollutant involved. Indeed, some toxic agents does not induce odor nuisance while untoxic agents do. Accordingly, the relationship between toxicity and odor nuisance should be always analyzed in detail evaluating on the characteristics of the airborne mixture and the type of the source involved.},

@article{Muttoo2022,
abstract = {Background
The developing lung is highly susceptible to environmental toxicants, with both short- and long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants linked to early childhood effects. This study assessed the short-term exposure effects of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM10) on lung function in infants aged 6 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 months, the early developmental phase of child growth.
Methods
Lung function was determined by multiple breath washout and tidal breathing measurement in non-sedated infants. Individual exposure to NO2 and PM10 was determined by hybrid land use regression and dispersion modelling, with two-week average estimates (preceding the test date). Linear mixed models were used to adjust for the repeated measures design and an age*exposure interaction was introduced to obtain effect estimates for each age group.
Results
There were 165 infants that had lung function testing, with 82 of them having more than one test occasion. Exposure to PM10 ($\mu$g/m3) resulted in a decline in tidal volume at 6 weeks [-0.4 ml (−0.9; 0.0), p = 0.065], 6 months [-0.5 ml (−1.0; 0.0), p = 0.046] and 12 months [-0.3 ml (−0.7; 0.0), p = 0.045]. PM10 was related to an increase in respiratory rate and minute ventilation, while a decline was observed for functional residual capacity for the same age groups, though not statistically significant for these outcomes. Such associations were however less evident for exposure to NO2, with inconsistent changes observed across measurement parameters and age groups.
Conclusion
Our study suggests that PM10 results in acute lung function impairments among infants from a low-socioeconomic setting, while the association with NO2 is less convincing.},

abstract = {Objectives
Exposure to air pollution is associated with increased risks of several adverse conditions in newborns, such as preterm birth. Whether air pollution is associated with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia remains unclear. We aimed to develop and validate an air-quality-based model to better predict neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.
Methods
A multicenter, population-based cohort of neonates with a gestational age (GA) ≥35 weeks and birth weight ≥2000 g was enrolled in the study. The study was conducted in Shanghai, China, from July 2017 to December 2018. The daily average concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameters≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) and ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) were measured. Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia was diagnosed according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines by trained neonatologists. We used logistic least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to screen air pollutant indicators related to neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and build an air-quality signature for each patient. An air-quality-based nomogram was then established to predict the risk of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.
Results
A total of 11196 neonates were evaluated. Prenatal PM10, CO and NO2 exposure and postpartum SO2 exposure were significantly associated with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. The air-quality score was calculated according to the hyperbilirubinemia-related pollutants. The air-quality score of the hyperbilirubinemia group was significantly higher than that of the nonhyperbilirubinemia group (P < .01, odds ratio = 2.97). An air-quality-based logistic regression model was built and showed good discrimination (C-statistic of 0.675 [95% CI (confidence interval), 0.658 to 0.692]) and good calibration. Decision curve analysis showed that the air-quality-based model was better than the traditional clinical model in predicting neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.
Conclusions
The findings of this study suggest that ambient air pollution exposure is associated with an increased risk of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Our results encourage further exploration of this possibility in future studies.},

abstract = {Background
the built environment in urban areas may have side effects on children's respiratory health, whilst less is known for adulthood.
Aim
to assess the association between increasing exposure to grey spaces and allergic status in an adult general population sample.
Methods
2070 subjects (age range 15–84 yrs), living in Pisa/Cascina, Italy, were investigated in 1991–93 through a questionnaire on health status and risk factors, skin prick test (SPT), serum Immunoglobulins E (IgE), and serum antibodies to benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE)-DNA adducts. Land-cover exposure within a 1000 m buffer from each subject's home address was assessed through the CORINE Land Cover program (CLC 1990) within the FP7/HEALS project (2013–2018). Participants' residential addresses were geocoded and the proportion of surrounding grey spaces was calculated. Through logistic regression models, adjusting for potential confounding factors, the effect of a 10% increase in grey spaces exposure on allergic biomarkers/conditions was assessed; the relationship with serum antibodies to BPDE-DNA adducts positivity was also analyzed.
Results
A 10% increase in grey spaces coverage was associated with a higher probability of having SPT positivity (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02-1.13), seasonal SPT positivity (OR 1.12, 1.05-1.19), polysensitization (OR 1.11, 1.04-1.19), allergic rhinitis (OR 1.10, 1.04-1.17), co-presence of SPT positivity and asthma/allergic rhinitis (OR 1.16, 1.08-1.25), asthma/allergic rhinitis (OR 1.06, 1.00-1.12), presence of serum antibodies to BPDE-DNA adducts positivity (OR 1.07, 1.01-1.14).
Conclusions
grey spaces have adverse effects on allergic status and are related to a biomarker of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exposure in adulthood. Thus, they may be used as a proxy of urban environmental exposure.},

Counties were equally divided into urban and rural groups based on the median of the percentage of urban residents across Jiangsu counties obtained from the National Population Census in 2010. We first conducted time-series analyses to estimate the county-specific effect of ozone using generalized linear models, then pooled the effect estimates by random-effects modeling. A 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in the 4-day moving average (lag 0–3) of ambient ozone exposure was associated with increases of 0.66% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.36%–0.95%) in daily nonaccidental mortality in rural areas and 0.42% in urban areas (95% CI, 0.27%–0.56%). Short-term ambient ozone exposure was associated with an increased risk of mortality caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and stroke.

abstract = {Introduction
Green space and air pollution have been recognized as vital health determinants. There is a paucity of studies examining the interplay between green space, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and the incidence of specific cancers.
Objective
We aimed to explore the contributions of green space and ambient PM2.5 to the risk of specific cancers in terms of the most common cancers based on incidence or mortality rate in Taiwan and to ascertain the interaction between green space and PM2.5 and their role in cancer risk.
Materials and methods
This retrospective longitudinal cohort study included 407,415 participants. Data were obtained from the 2000–2015 Mei Jau Health Examination Database linked to the Taiwan Cancer Registry and Causes of Death datasets. All participants were aged ≥20 years and had no history of cancer. The environmental exposure were the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the 2-year average PM2.5 at baseline. Multivariate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. We adjusted for covariates including demographics, anthropometrics, comorbidities, health behaviors, biochemical data, and environmental factors.
Results
During a median follow-up of 10.37 years, 11,576 cancer cases were reported. PM2.5 exposure increased the risk of all cancers (HR: 1.11, [95% CI: 1.06–1.15]), stomach cancer (HR: 1.27, [1.02–1.58]), endocrine gland cancer (HR: 2.13, [1.39–3.26]), breast cancer (HR: 1.12, [1.03–1.22]), and lung cancer (HR: 1.12, [1.01–1.24]). An increase in NDVI reduced the risk of prostate cancer (HR: 0.93, [0.88–0.99]) and lung cancer (HR: 0.95, [0.91–0.99]). NDVI influenced the incidence of prostate and all cancers by reducing PM2.5 concentrations.
Conclusion
Long-term PM2.5 exposure is associated with an increased risk of some types of cancers. In contrast, an increase in environmental green space exposure is associated with lowering of the risk of prostate and lung cancer.},

The monthly average fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration was up to 276 $\mu$g/m3 in Hebei Province, which adversely affects human health. However, few studies evaluated the coordinated health impact of exposure to PM (PM2.5 and PM10) and other key air pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, and surface ozone (O3)). In this study, we systematically analyzed the health risks (both mortality and morbidity) due to multiple air pollutants exposures in Hebei Province. The economic loss associated with these health consequences was estimated using the value of statistical life (VSL) and cost of illness (COI) methods. Our results show the health burden and economic loss attributable to multiple ambient air pollutants exposures in Hebei Province is substantial. In 2017, the total premature mortality from multiple air pollutants exposures in Hebei Province was 69,833 (95% CI: 55,549–83,028), which was 2.9 times higher than that of the Pearl River Delta region (PRD). Most of the potential economic loss (79.65%) was attributable to premature mortality from air pollution. The total economic loss due to the health consequences of multiple air pollutants exposures was 175.16 (95% CI: 134.61–224.61) billion Chinese Yuan (CNY), which was 4.92% of Hebei Province's annual gross domestic product (GDP). Thus, the adverse health effects and economic loss caused by exposure to multiple air pollutants should be seriously taken into consideration. To alleviate these damages, Hebei's government ought to establish more stringent measures and regulations to better control air pollution.},

We included 13,418 adults above 45 years old in this study. We defined MetS according to the Joint Interim Societies. The concentration of air pollutants (including fine particulate matter (PM2.5), inhalable particles (PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO)) were estimated by ground-based measurements and satellite remote sensing products. We assessed the level of PA by metabolic equivalent (MET)-hour/week by summing the MET of all activities. We applied logistic regression models with sampling weight to explore the independent and joint associations of PA and air pollutants on MetS. Interaction plots were conducted to exhibit estimates of air pollutants on MetS as a function of PA. We found that all air pollutants were positively associated with the odds of MetS, while PA showed beneficial associations with MetS. The associations of air pollution on MetS decreased accompanied the increase of PA, while the detrimental effects between air pollutants and MetS did not be reversed by PA. In conclusion, PA may attenuate the associations of air pollutants with MetS, although in polluted areas, suggesting that keeping PA might be an effective way to reduce the adverse effects of air pollution with MetS.},

Dysregulation of the neuroendocrine hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and sympathetic-adrenal medullary (SAM) axes is essential in progression of COPD. However, it is not clear whether air pollution exposure is associated with neuroendocrine responses in individuals with and without COPD. Based on a panel study of 51 stable COPD patients and 78 non-COPD participants with 384 clinical visits, we measured the morning serum levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, norepinephrine, and epinephrine as indicators of stress hormones released from the HPA and SAM axes. Ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and meteorological conditions were continuously monitored at the station from 2 weeks before the start of clinical visits. Linear mixed-effects models were used to estimate associations between differences in stress hormones following an average of 1–14-day exposures to NO2 and PM2.5. The average 1 day air pollutant levels prior to the clinical visits were 24.4 ± 14.0 ppb for NO2 and 55.6 ± 41.5 $\mu$g/m3 for PM2.5. We observed significant increases in CRH, ACTH, and norepinephrine, and decreases in cortisol and epinephrine with interquartile range increase in the average NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations in all participants. In the stratified analyses, we identified significant between-group difference in epinephrine following NO2 exposure in individuals with and without COPD. These results may suggest the susceptibility of COPD patients to the neuroendocrine responses associated with short-term air pollution exposure.},

Baseline health statistics were gathered from health registers and applied to each resident according to individual-level data on age and/or sex. Concentration-response parameters were derived from current epidemiological literature, specifically meta-analyses. A Gaussian dispersion model (AERMOD) combined with a detailed emission database was used to calculate NO2 emissions from traffic, which could be applied on an individual-level using data on each person's residential coordinates. The adjusted exposure scenario replaced all vehicles on municipal roads having Euro 5 or lower emission standards with Euro 6 equivalents. This LEZ would, on average, decrease NO2 concentrations by 13.4%, preventing an estimated 9–26 deaths in Malm{\"{o}} each year. Additionally, 12 respiratory disease hospitalizations, 8 childhood asthma cases, and 9 cases of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were estimated to be avoided annually.

abstract = {Approximately 3.8 billion people in low- and middle-income countries use unclean fuels as a source of primary cooking fuel as well as for heating. For pregnant women, the toxic chemicals produced by combustion of unclean fuels not only affect women's health directly, but particulate matter and carbon monoxide are absorbed in maternal blood and cross the placental barrier impairing fetal tissue growth. PRISMA 2009 guidelines were used for this systematic review. The inclusion criteria were quantitative, peer reviewed journal articles published within a date range of May 1, 2013–June 12, 2021 examining birth outcomes related to household air pollution from type of cooking fuel in low- and middle-income countries. The quality of available evidence was evaluated using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) risk of bias rating tool. Of the 553 studies screened, 23 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Of the studies that met the inclusion criteria, 14 were cross-sectional, 5 cohort, 1 case-control and 3 randomized control trials conducted across 15 different countries. A range of birth outcomes are reported across studies including birthweight (19), small for gestational age (6), spontaneous abortion (3), preterm birth (6), stillbirth (7) and neonatal mortality (6). The reviewed studies presented evidence for an increased risk of low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB), small for gestational age (SGA), stillbirth, neonatal mortality and reduction in birthweight with solid fuel and kerosene use compared to cleaner fuels like gas and LPG. Systematically reviewing the evidence and risk of bias ratings illuminated several gaps in the current literature related to exposure assessment, outcome measurement and adequacy of adjustment for confounding.},

abstract = {In spring, ozone (O3) pollution frequently occurrs in eastern China, but key drivers remain uncertain. In this study, interannual variations in springtime ozone in Shanghai, China, from 2013 to 2021, were investigated to assess the health impacts and the effectiveness of recent air pollution control measures. A combination of ground-level measurements of regulated air pollutants, lidar observations, and backward trajectories of air masses was used to identify the key drivers for enhancing springtime O3. The results show that external imports of O3 driven by atmospheric circulation are notable sources of springtime surface O3. For example, the downward transport from the free troposphere could contribute to over 50% of surface O3 in the morning. The surface O3 mixing ratios in spring exhibited an upward trend of 0.93 ppb yr−1 (p < 0.05) from 2013 to 2021. The change in meteorological variables, particularly the increase in air temperature, could explain nearly 87% of the springtime O3 upward trend. The change in anthropogenic emissions of precursors only contributed to a small fraction (<13%) of the increase in springtime O3. The cumulative exposure of urban residents to O3 in spring also exhibited a significant upward trend (111 ppb yr−1, p < 0.05). With the rapid increase in surface O3, premature respiratory mortality attributable to O3 exposure has fluctuated at approximately 2933 deaths per year since 2016, even though the total deaths from respiratory diseases have significantly declined. Long-term exposure to high O3 concentrations is a significant contributor to premature respiratory mortality.},

Based on two studies conducted in three Chinses cities using cross-sectional (Beijing, 425 participants) and panel study (Tianjin and Shanghai, 92 participants with 361 repeated measurements) designs, this study explored the associations between short-term exposure to ambient PM and blood cell parameters, and the effect modification by psychosocial stress. Increasing PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with decreases in red blood cell (RBC) count and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and increases in mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelets count (PLT) and platelet hematocrit (PCT) in both studies. For instance, a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increment in PM2.5 concentration was associated with a 1.04% (95%CI: 0.16%, 1.92%) increase in PLT (4-d) and a 1.09% (95%CI: 0.31%, 1.87%) increase in PCT (4-d) in the cross-sectional study, and a 0.64% (95%CI: 0.06%, 1.22%) increase in PLT (1-d) and a 0.72% (95%CI: 0.33%, 1.11%) increase in PCT (1-d) in the panel study, respectively. In addition, stronger increases in MCV, PLT, and PCT associated with PM2.5 exposure were found in higher psychosocial stress group compared to lower psychosocial stress group (p for interaction <0.10), indicating that blood cell parameters of individuals with higher psychosocial stress might be more susceptible to the early damages of PM2.5 exposure.},

abstract = {Background
The widely used Air Quality Index (AQI) has been criticized due to its inaccuracy, leading to the development of the air quality health index (AQHI), an improvement on the AQI. However, there is currently no consensus on the most appropriate construction strategy for the AQHI.
Objectives
In this study, we aimed to evaluate the utility of AQHIs constructed by different models and health outcomes, and determine a better strategy.
Methods
Based on the daily time-series outpatient visits and hospital admissions from 299 hospitals (January 2016–December 2018), and mortality (January 2017–December 2019) in Guangzhou, China, we utilized cumulative risk index (CRI) method, Bayesian multi-pollutant weighted (BMW) model and standard method to construct AQHIs for different health outcomes. The effectiveness of AQHIs constructed by different strategies was evaluated by a two-stage validation analysis and examined their exposure-response relationships with the cause-specific morbidity and mortality.
Results
Validation by different models showed that AQHI constructed with the BMW model (BMW-AQHI) had the strongest association with the health outcome either in the total population or subpopulation among air quality indexes, followed by AQHI constructed with the CRI method (CRI-AQHI), then common AQHI and AQI. Further validation by different health outcomes showed that AQHI constructed with the risk of outpatient visits generally exhibited the highest utility in presenting mortality and morbidity, followed by AQHI constructed with the risk of hospitalizations, then mortality-based AQHI and AQI. The contributions of NO2 and O3 to the final AQHI were prominent, while the contribution of SO2 and PM2.5 were relatively small.
Conclusions
The BMW model is likely to be more effective for AQHI construction than CRI and standard methods. Based on the BMW model, the AQHI constructed with the outpatient data may be more effective in presenting short-term health risks associated with the co-exposure to air pollutants than the mortality-based AQHI and existing AQIs.},

This study aimed to examine the effect of orally administered ash-water dilution on the gut of mice under normal and inflammatory conditions. Balb/c mice received ash-released soluble and dust-suspended components in the drinking water for 14 days. On day 7, animals were intrarectally instilled with TNBS in ethanol or flagellin from Salmonella typhimurium in PBS. At sacrifice, colon segments were collected and histologic damage, mRNA expression and cytokine levels in tissue were evaluated. In addition, these parameters were also evaluated in IL-10 null mice. We found that mice that received 5% w. fine-ash dilution in the drinking water worsened colitis signs. Weight loss, shortening of the colon, tissue edema with mucosa and submucosa cell infiltration and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were enhanced compared to control mice. A more pronounced inflammation was observed in IL-10 null mice. In addition, markers of NLRP3-dependent inflammasome activation were found in animals exposed to ash. In conclusion, ingestion of contaminated water with dust-suspended particulate matter enhanced the inflammatory response in the gut, probably due to alteration of the gut barrier and promoting an intense contact with the luminal content. This study critically appraises the response for fine particulate matter in uncommon illnesses reported for volcanic ash pollution. We suggest actions to enable better prediction and assessment the health impacts of volcanic eruptions.},

Mitochondria produce 90% of ATP and make up 30% of the volume of cardiomyocytes. Thus knowledge of myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction due to PM2.5 exposure is essential for further cardiotoxic effects. Here, the mechanism of PM2.5-induced cardiac hypertrophy through calcium overload and mitochondrial dysfunction was investigated in vivo and in vitro. Male and female BALB/c mice were given 1.28, 5.5, and 11 mg PM2.5/kg bodyweight weekly through oropharyngeal inhalation for four weeks and were assigned to low, medium, and high dose groups, respectively. PM2.5-induced myocardial edema and cardiac hypertrophy were detected in the high-dose group. Mitochondria were scattered and ruptured with abnormal ultrastructural morphology. In vitro experiments on human cardiomyocyte AC16 showed that exposure to PM2.5 for 24 h caused opened mitochondrial permeability transition pore –leading to excessive calcium production, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, weakened mitochondrial respiratory metabolism capacity, and decreased ATP production. Nevertheless, the administration of calcium chelator ameliorated the mitochondrial damage in the PM2.5-treated group. Our in vivo and in vitro results confirmed that calcium overload under PM2.5 exposure triggered mTOR/AKT/GSK-3$\beta$ activation, leading to mitochondrial bioenergetics dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a prominent risk factor for cardiovascular aging in older adults and causes mild syndromes or other comorbidities in otherwise healthy older adults. Accordingly, a precise tool for PM2.5 exposure risk stratification is urgently needed. We aimed to address this need by comparing the performances of seven types of epigenetic age and chronological age to classify the effects of short-term PM2.5 exposure on blood pressure (BP), a typical clinical surrogate marker of cardiovascular aging.
Methods
We conducted a panel study of the Chinese healthy adults aged 60–69 years through five monthly visits. Personal PM2.5 exposures were measured using wearable monitoring devices for three consecutive days, and DNA methylation was determined by the Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip using blood samples collected at each visit. Systolic BP, diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure were measured by the electronic BP monitor. Linear mixed models with interaction terms between PM2.5 and different ages were used to assess their potential usefulness for stratification.
Results
DNAmPhenoAge, Skin & blood clock, DNAmGrimAge acceleration, and DunedinPoAm had significant modifying effects on the relationship between PM2.5 and BP. For instance, a 10-$\mu$g/m3 increase in the 72-h moving mean PM2.5 was significantly associated with 0.30% (95% CI: 0.10%, 0.51%) and −0.07% (95% CI: -0.32%, 0.18%) increases in systolic BP at higher and lower DNAmPhenoAge acceleration, respectively. Joint models further revealed that using a combination of epigenetic ages could more precisely stratify the effect of PM2.5 on BP.
Conclusions
Our research indicates that epigenetic age may be a useful tool for evaluating the effect of short-term PM2.5 exposure on cardiovascular aging status.},

Copşa Mică and Zlatna are two of the most polluted heavy metals regions in Romania due to non-ferrous metallurgy for a long period of time. Recruitment of participants was made by a random selection of an entire class for each age within the schools and kindergartens from the study areas (Copşa Mică and Zlatna) and from the non-polluted region. Interpretation of data was performed using statistical analysis (ANOVA and Student's t-test). Preschool children (4–6 years) were tested using Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) tests, Animal House and labyrinth samples. The results of the attention tests applied to pre-school children were lower in the study areas compared to the control group, but no statistical differences were found. The results of the attention tests applied to children aged between 8 and 11 years (Toulouse-Pieron test and Traffic light test) indicate lower average scores within the study groups from polluted areas, compared to the control group. Differences with statistically significance were registered for the 8 years age group (p = 0.037). In these areas efficient strategies and precise intervention measures are needed in order to limit or remove the heavy metal exposure and protect the human health, especially the groups exposed to a high level of risk.},

abstract = {Objectives
The concentrations and characteristics of trace metals in PM2.5 vary in time and location and can result in various health impacts. The current study aimed to investigate the characteristics and distributions of PM2.5-bound trace metals and further identify the possible sources and conduct health risk assessment in Zhejiang, China.
Methods
PM2.5 samples were collected during 2015–2019 at seven monitoring sites in Zhejiang, China. Twelve trace metals in ambient PM2.5 were determined. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was applied to quantify the potential sources of PM2.5. The chemical daily intake (CDI) via ingestion, exposure concentration (EC) via inhalation and dermally absorbed dose (DAD) via contact were estimated to assess the health risks.
Results
The seasonal variations of both PM2.5 and trace metals showed the highest in winter and the lowest in summer. Among the studied trace metals, Aluminum (Al), Lead (Pb) and Manganese (Mn) had the highest concentrations. Soil dust, coal combustion and traffic-related emissions were the main sources of the air pollution at most sites in Zhejiang. Health risk assessment showed that ingestion was the primary exposure pathway, and children were more likely to be affected by ambient trace metals. The non-carcinogenic risks of arsenic (As), Pb, Antimony (Sb) and Thallium (Tl) as well as carcinogenic risks of As, Pb and nickel (Ni) should be paid more attention to.
Conclusions
PM2.5-bound trace metals are of great public health concern, particularly related to the potential health risks of As, Pb and Tl. Corresponding emission control measures of metal elements in PM2.5 should be considered.},

In addition, the national average CR was beyond the safe level of 1 × 10−4 (CR = 5.69 × 10−3). The multicriteria decision tool, RAFSI, indicates 1.5 km as the best alternative buffer protection distance for an acceptable risk level.

To date, few epidemiological studies, especially in developing countries, have focused on these adverse effects. In the past decade, air pollution sources in Vietnam have noticeably increased, resulting to the elevated concentrations of ambient air pollutants particularly fine PM or PM with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5). Hence, investigating the short-term association between PM2.5 and MBDs is worthwhile. In this study, a quasi-Poisson time-series regression analysis was used to investigate the association between PM2.5 exposure and daily hospitalizations for MBDs to the Ho Chi Minh City Mental Health Hospital during 2017–2020. A natural cubic spline smooth function for time was used to screen out long-term and seasonality trends. Stratified analyses were also performed by sex, age, and season. During study period, 9,986 hospitalizations for MBDs were recorded and included in the analysis. Results suggested that a 10 $\mu$g/m3 daily increase in PM2.5 concentration was associated with a statistically significant 2.96% (95% confidence interval: 0.23%–5.76%) increase in hospitalizations for MBDs. The effects of PM2.5 exposure on hospital admissions were more pronounced in female patients and the middle-age group (35–59 years). This finding could increase awareness regarding prevention and minimization of MBDs on the public.},

We performed population-based 1:4 case–control study by using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database from 2000 to 2016. The subjects were aged 20–65 years, residing in western Taiwan, and did not have a history of any renal or urinary system disease in 2000. The case cohort included those who had at least three outpatient visits or one hospitalization between 2001 and 2016 with codes for CGN as per International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-Ninth and Tenth Revisions. Controls were randomly sampled age-, sex-, and urbanization-matched individuals without renal and urinary system diseases. Petrochemical exposure was evaluated by the distance to the nearest PIP of the residential township, and petrochemical exposure probability was examined considering the monthly prevailing wind direction. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine the association between petrochemical exposure and CGN risk. A total of 320,935 subjects were included in the final analysis (64,187 cases and 256,748 controls). After adjustment for potential confounders, living in townships within a 3-km radius of PIPs was associated with a higher risk of CGN (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28–1.37). Compared with townships more than 20 km away from PIPs, those within 10 km of PIPs were associated with significantly increased risks of CGN in a dose-dependent manner. When prevailing wind was considered, townships with high exposure probability were associated with a significantly increased risk of CGN. We found that those residing near PIPs or with high petrochemical exposure probability had a higher risk of CGN. These findings highlight the need for monitoring environmental nephrotoxic substances and the renal health of residents living near PIPs.},

Limited studies have been conducted to assess the relationship between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and AF attacks. This study aimed to explore the association between short-term ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure and outpatient visits for AF in Xi'an, China. Data on daily AF outpatient visits and air pollutants from 2013 to 2019 (2555 days) were obtained. A time-series approach using over-dispersed Poisson generalized additive model (GAM) was employed, and stratified analyses were performed to investigate the potential modifying effects by season, age, and gender. A total of 8307 outpatient visits for AF were recorded. Increased levels of NO2 were associated with increased AF outpatient visits, and the most significant effect estimates were observed at lag 03: A 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase of NO2 at lag 03 was related to an elevation of 5.59% (95% CI: 2.67%, 8.51%) in daily outpatient visits for AF. Stratified analyses showed that there were no gender and age difference in the effect of NO2, while more obvious association was observed in cool seasons (October to March) than in warm seasons (April to September). In summary, short-term ambient NO2 exposure can be positively associated with daily outpatient visits for AF, especially in cool seasons. This work provided novel data that the association between air pollutants and AF can vary by seasons, further supporting that the prevention of cardiovascular health effects should be strengthened in winter.},

abstract = {Traditional cooking with solid fuels (biomass, animal dung, charcoals, coal) creates household air pollution that leads to millions of premature deaths and disability worldwide each year. Exposure to household air pollution is highest in low- and middle-income countries. Using data from a stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial of a cookstove intervention among 230 households in Honduras, we analyzed the impact of household and personal variables on repeated 24-h measurements of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC) exposure. Six measurements were collected approximately six-months apart over the course of the three-year study. Multivariable mixed models explained 37% of variation in personal PM2.5 exposure and 49% of variation in kitchen PM2.5 concentrations. Additionally, multivariable models explained 37% and 47% of variation in personal and kitchen BC concentrations, respectively. Stove type, season, presence of electricity, primary stove location, kitchen enclosure type, stove use time, and presence of kerosene for lighting were all associated with differences in geometric mean exposures. Stove type explained the most variability of the included variables. In future studies of household air pollution, tracking the cooking behaviors and daily activities of participants, including outdoor exposures, may explain exposure variation beyond the household and personal variables considered here.},

abstract = {Traffic exhaust is a main source of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in cities. Heavy-duty diesel trucks (HDDTs), the primary mode of freight transport, contribute significantly to PM2.5, posing a great threat to public health. However, existing research based on dispersion models to simulate pollutant concentrations lacks high-spatiotemporal-resolution emission inventories of HDDTs as input data, and the public health effects of such emissions in different populations have not been thoroughly assessed. To fill this gap, we focused on Beijing as the research area and developed a high-resolution PM2.5 emission inventory for HDDTs based on Global Navigation Satellite System-equipped vehicle trajectory data. We then simulated the fine-scale spatial distribution of diesel-related PM2.5 and assessed the population exposure by integrating the dispersion model and population distributions. Further, we quantified the mortality attributable to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) plus lower respiratory infections (LRIs) related to PM2.5 emissions from HDDTs. Results showed that 3.3% of Beijing people lived in areas with high PM2.5 HDDT emissions, which were near intercity highways. Furthermore, the estimated number of NCD + LRI annual premature deaths attributed to PM2.5 HDDT emissions in Beijing was 339 (95% CI: 276–401). The NCD + LRI mortality increased with age, and deaths were more frequent in males than females. Our results aid the identification of HDDT PM2.5 emission exposure hotspots for the formulation of effective mitigation measures and provide important insights into the adverse health impacts of HDDT emissions.},

Air pollution exposure in pregnancy can cause molecular level alterations that might influence later disease susceptibility.
Objectives
We investigated DNA methylation (DNAm) and telomere length (TL) in the cord blood in relation to gestational PM10 exposure and explored potential gestational windows of susceptibility.
Methods
Cord blood epigenome-wide DNAm (N = 384) and TL (N = 500) were measured in children of the Italian birth cohort Piccolipi{\`{u}}, using the Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip and qPCR, respectively. PM10 daily exposure levels, based on maternal residential address, were estimated for different gestational periods using models based on satellite data. Epigenome-wide analysis to identify differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) was conducted, followed by a pathway analysis and replication analysis in an second Piccolipi{\`{u}} dataset. Distributed lag models (DLMs) using weekly exposures were used to study the association of PM10 exposure across pregnancy with telomere length, as well as with the DMPs that showed robust associations.
Results
Gestational PM10 exposure was associated with the DNA methylation of more than 250 unique DMPs, most of them identified in early gestation, and 1 DMR. Out of 151 DMPs available in the replication dataset, ten DMPs showed robust associations: eight were associated with exposure during early gestation and 2 with exposure during the whole pregnancy. These exposure windows were supported by the DLM analysis. The PM10 exposure between 15th and 20th gestational week seem to be associated with shorter telomeres at birth, while exposure between 24th and 29th was associated with longer telomeres.
Discussion
The early pregnancy period is a potential critical window during which PM10 exposure can influence cord blood DNA methylation. The results from the TL analysis were consistent with previous findings and merit further exploration in future studies. The study underlines the importance of considering gestational windows outside of the predefined trimesters that may not always overlap with biologically relevant windows of exposure.},

A total of 48,891 CEDVs were recorded in a period of 1019 days. We estimated a significant percentage increase for each 10 $\mu$g/m3 of PM10 at Lag0-5 (2.8%, 95%CI 0.6–5.0), PM2.5 at Lag0-6 (3.7%, 95%CI 0.1–7.6), O3 at Lag0-5 (1.1%, 95%CI 0.2–2.0), NO2 at Lag0-4 (2.5%, 95%CI 0.3–4.7) and for each 1 mg/m3 of CO at Lag0 (6.6%, 95%CI 0.3–13.2). Overall, 10.3% of CEDVs in Mexico City may be related to PM10 exposure, 9.5% to PM2.5, 10.3% to O3, 11% to NO2 and 5.7% to CO.

Cluster analysis of the 500-hPa winds for a 30-year period (1990–2019) identifies a set of weather patterns that are then used to explore daily anomalous concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter. Above-normal levels of pollution occur under the influence of a mid-troposphere high pressure system centered around 20°N that shifts eastward over Mexico. This weather pattern is characterized by below-normal cloudiness, greater solar radiation, weaker surface winds, and a stronger morning temperature inversion that persists later than normal. High pollution events associated with this pattern occur preferentially during the dry season: March–May for O3, and December–February for NO2 and PM2.5. PM10 events occurred evenly throughout the season. At the interannual scale, the El–Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation is related to the frequency of pollution-related weather patterns: La–Ni{\~{n}}a (El–Ni{\~{n}}o) years favor the occurrence of patterns associated with more (less) pollution during the dry season.

Limited studies have explored the association between PM2.5-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and lung function, but studies at the personal level in healthy young adults are scarce. Here, we assessed personal PM2.5 and PM2.5-bound PAH levels in a panel of 45 healthy young adults by a time-weighted model. The aims were to investigate the relationship between personal exposure and lung function by a linear mixed effect model, and to explore the mediating effects of oxidative stress in this association. The results showed that personal exposure to PM2.5 and PAHs had the greatest negative effect on forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% vital capacity (FEF25–75) at lag 3 days. An IQR increase in personal PM2.5 exposure was associated with a change of 0.35% (95% CI: 0.27%, 0.42%) in FEV1, 0.39% (95% CI: 0.29%, 0.47%) in PEF and 0.36% (95% CI: 0.27%, 0.45%) in FEF25–75. An IQR increase in personal PAH exposure was associated with a decrease of 0.63% (95% CI: 0.55%, 0.69%) in FEV1, 0.69% (95% CI: 0.61%, 0.75%) in PEF and 0.66% (95% CI: 0.57%, 0.72%) in FEF25–75. Additionally, exposure to PM2.5 and PAHs resulted in the strongest positive effects on urinary 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and 8-iso-prostaglandin-F2$\alpha$ (8-iso-PGF2$\alpha$). Of these, 8-OHdG mediated 10.33%, 8.87% and 9.45% of the associations of personal PM2.5 exposure with FEV1, PEF and FEF25–75, respectively. Our results revealed that personal exposure to PM2.5 and PAHs was associated with lung function decline in healthy young adults, and urinary 8-OHdG mediated the association between personal PM2.5 and lung function.},

Systemic inflammation may serve as a biological mechanism linking air pollution to poor health but supporting evidence from studies of long-term pollutant exposure and inflammatory cytokines is inconsistent.
Objective
We studied associations between multiple particulate matter (PM) and gaseous air pollutants and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines within two nationwide cohorts of men and women.
Methods
Data were obtained from 16,151 women in the Nurses' Health Study and 7,930 men in the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study with at least one measure of circulating adiponectin, C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Interleukin-6 (IL-6) or soluble tumor necrosis-factor receptor-2 (sTNFR-2). Exposure to PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5, 2.5–10, and ≤10 $\mu$m (PM2.5, PM2.5-10, PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was estimated using spatio-temporal models and were linked to participants' addresses at the time of blood draw. Averages of the 1-, 3-, and 12-months prior to blood draw were examined. Associations between each biomarker and pollutant were estimated from linear regression models adjusted for individual and contextual covariates.
Results
In adjusted models, we observed a 2.72% (95% CI: 0.43%, 5.95%), 3.11% (−0.12%, 6.45%), and 3.67% (0.19%, 7.26%) increase in CRP associated with a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in 1-, 3-, and 12- month averaged NO2 in women. Among men, there was a statistically significant 5.96% (95% CI: 0.07%, 12.20%), 6.99% (95% CI: 0.29%, 14.15%), and 8.33% (95% CI: 0.35%, 16.94%) increase in CRP associated with a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in 1-, 3-, and 12-month averaged PM2.5-10, respectively. Increasing PM2.5-10 was associated with increasing IL-6 and sTNFR-2 among men over shorter exposure durations. There were no associations with exposures to PM2.5 or PM10, or with adiponectin. Findings were robust to sensitivity analyses restricting to disease-free controls and non-movers.
Conclusions
Across multiple long-term pollutant exposures and inflammatory markers, associations were generally weak. Focusing on specific pollutant-inflammatory mechanisms may clarify pathways.},

Reductions in indoor PM2.5 concentrations from air purifier use were modelled using findings from the literature for mean air purifier efficiency, mean indoor PM2.5 concentrations associated with air purifier use, and the relative risks associated with exposure. Life-table models were used to estimate changes to mortality from the following PM2.5-associated diseases: lung cancer, lower respiratory infection (LRI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ischemic heart disease (IHD), and stroke. Different scenarios were modelled to represent a range of daily use patterns, the starting age of use and the duration of the intervention. The overall impact of the central scenario, in which air purifiers were used during all hours whilst at home (15.6 h) for the entirety of the modelled period (birth to 97 years), was to increase life expectancy in the birth cohort by, on average, 138 and 120 days for males and females, respectively, and to add more than 23 million years of life (YLG) to the UK population. When used at home, air purifiers reduced indoor PM2.5 concentrations and prolonged life expectancy, but questions regarding feasibility of the intervention, occupant behaviour and social inequities remain. The estimation of the impact of use by the whole population is, however, important for informing policy and designing interventions.},

abstract = {Studies on the health effects of long-term ozone exposure remain limited with mixed results. One potential source of this inconsistency is the difference in exposure time metrics. This study aimed to investigate the association between long-term exposure to ambient ozone and mortality in South Korea, using different exposure metrics. We also examined whether heterogeneity between previous studies was due to the different exposure metrics. The study population comprised 179,806 participants from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (2002–2015) residing in seven major cities in South Korea. Several ozone exposure metrics (year-round 24-h, year-round 8-h, warm-season 24-h, and warm-season 8-h) were calculated. Time-varying Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association between ozone and all-cause and cause-specific mortalities. Random-effect meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis were performed to pool the effect estimates of previous studies and examine whether the exposure metric can explain the between-study heterogeneity. The hazard ratios (HRs) per 10 ppb increment in year-round 24-h ozone for all-cause (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.07–1.29) and circulatory (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.25–1.84) mortality were higher than those of the other metrics. Year-round 8-h ozone exhibited the largest association with respiratory mortality (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.04–1.96). A meta-analysis of 29 previous studies and the present study showed the largest HR for all-cause mortality from studies using year-round 8-h exposure (HR, 1.014; 95% CI, 0.994–1.033). The exposure metric was significantly associated with effect estimates in the multivariable meta-regression model. In conclusion, in the population-based cohort in South Korea, we found positive associations between several long-term ozone exposure metrics and mortality. The different ozone exposure metrics exhibited heterogeneous effect estimates. A year-round 24-h average ozone metric also could be considered an alternative long-term standard for ozone.},

abstract = {Background
It is well-documented that heavy metals are associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, there is few studies exploring effect of metal mixture on CVD. Therefore, the primary objective of present study was to investigate the joint effect of heavy metals on CVD and to identify the most influential metals in the mixture.
Methods
Original data for study subjects were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In this study, adults with complete data on 12 kinds of urinary metals (antimony, arsenic, barium, cadmium, cobalt, cesium, molybdenum, mercury, lead, thallium, tungsten, and uranium), cardiovascular disease, and core covariates were enrolled. We applied five different statistical strategies to examine the CVD risk with metal exposure, including multivariate logistic regression, adaptive elastic net combined with Environmental Risk Score, Quantile g-computation, Weighted Quantile Sum regression, and Bayesian kernel machine regression.
Results
Higher levels of cadmium, tungsten, cobalt, and antimony were significantly associated with Increased risk of CVD when covariates were adjusted for multivariate logistic regression. The results from multi-pollutant strategies all indicated that metal mixture was positively associated with the risk of CVD. Based on the results of multiple statistical strategies, it was determined that cadmium, tungsten, cobalt, and antimony exhibited the strongest positive correlations, whereas barium, lead, molybdenum, and thallium were most associated with negative correlations.
Conclusion
Overall, our study demonstrates that exposure to heavy metal mixture is linked to a higher risk of CVD. Meanwhile, this association may be driven primarily by cadmium, tungsten, cobalt, and antimony. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate or refute our primary findings as well as to identify other important heavy metals linked with CVD.},

However, the joint effect of multiple air pollutants on lipid profiles and the role of each pollutant are still unclear. This panel study aims to investigate and compare the overall associations of major air pollutants with lipid parameters in obese and normal-weight adults, and assess the relative importance of each pollutant for lipid parameters. Forty-four obese and 53 normal-weight young adults were recruited from December 2017 to June 2018 in Beijing, China. Their fasting blood was collected and serum lipid levels were measured in three visits. Six major air pollutants were included in this study, which were PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3 and CO. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) was implemented to estimate the joint effect of the six air pollutants on various lipid parameters. We found that decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in the obese group and increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-HDL-C in the normal-weight group were associated with the exposure to the mixture of six air pollutants above. Significant increases in total cholesterol (TC)/HDL-C and non-HDL-C/HDL-C were observed in both groups, and the effect was stronger in obese group. Of the six air pollutants above, O3 had the largest posterior inclusion probability in above lipid indices, ranging from 0.75 to 1.00. In the obese group, approximately linear exposure-response relationships were observed over the whole range of logarithmic O3-8 h max concentration, while in the normal-weight group, these relationships existed when the logarithmic concentration exceeded about 2.8. Therefore, lipid profiles of obese adults may be more sensitive to air pollution and this study highlights the importance of strengthening emissions control efforts for O3 in the future.},

In 2014, the Morwell open-cut brown coal mine adjacent to the Hazelwood power station in the Latrobe Valley region of Victoria, Australia, caught fire as a result of nearby wildfires, and exposed the local community to a prolonged period of deteriorated air quality. The aim of this study was to examine how exposure to coal mine fire-related fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during the event affected the utilisation of local health services (ambulance attendances; emergency department (ED) presentations; hospital admissions) for mental health conditions. A time-series analysis indicated that mine fire-related PM2.5 exposure was associated with short-term increases in ambulance attendances and ED presentations but not hospital admissions. To allow for delays between exposure and changes in service utilisation, different lag periods were assessed. The most prominent effects were observed over a 5-day lag period where, for each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in daily mean mine fire-related PM2.5, the risk of an ambulance attendance for anxiety increased by 38% (95%CI: 13%–69%) and the risk of an ED presentation for depression increased by 36% (95%CI: 3%–79%). Accordingly, ambulance and hospital services should expect to encounter an increase in the number of people seeking assistance for mental health conditions during extreme air pollution events and mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that surges in demand for mental health care during these circumstances can be accommodated.},

abstract = {People spend most of their time indoors, isolated from the outdoor environment where serious air pollution usually occurs. To what extent outdoor air pollution contributes to their daily personal exposure and inhaled dose? To fill this knowledge gap, an exposure assessment study was conducted for indoor-active university students during a wintertime period of hazy and non-hazy (clear) days in Beijing. Indoor and outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) samples were collected at six indoor microenvironments, and two outdoor environments representing traffic and ambient exposure in the university, respectively, to estimate the personal exposure of students. The average daily personal exposure and poteantial inhaled dose on hazy days (124.8 ± 72.3 $\mu$g m−3 and 2.74 ± 1.53 mg) were much higher than that on clear days (57.5 ± 31.9 $\mu$g m−3 and 1.26 ± 0.59 mg), indicating a significant influence from the ambient air quality. The indoor PM2.5 concentrations were significantly and positively correlated with the outdoor ones (r = 0.67–0.96) with an FINF (infiltration factor) range of 0.44–0.81 during sampling periods. The outdoor-origin air contributed 68%–95% to the total indoor PM2.5, the average of which was higher during haze events (87%) than clear periods (73%). Correspondingly, outdoor-origin PM2.5 contributed around 105.4 $\mu$g m−3 and 2.41 mg (85% and 89%) to the daily exposure and inhaled dose of college students on hazy days, respectively, compared to just 39.2 $\mu$g m−3 and 0.95 mg (68% and 75%) on clear days. Our results highlight the significant contribution of outdoor-origin PM2.5 occurred indoor to both the daily personal exposure and inhaled dose due to air pollution filtration between outdoor and indoor environments. These also suggest a continuous effort not only on ambient air quality improvements, but also on environmental friendly building for public health protection with lower exposure.},

abstract = {Frying is one of the cooking methods which generates mono aromatic hydrocarbons, including benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX); subsequently, it affects health through carcinogenic (CR) and non-carcinogenic risks (n-CR). However, their environmental effects known by secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and ozone formation potential (OFP) were also attended by many scientists. Therefore, this study quantified the BTEX emissions from 4 types of most commonly used edible oils (canola, corn, sunflower, and blend) under various frying conditions of temperatures and food additives. Furthermore, the effects of the chemicals in the light of health (CR and n-CR) and environment (SOA and OFP) were also investigated. The study results showed that higher temperatures could significantly increase the emissions, while the addition of food ingredients significantly reduces the emissions. The rank order of emitted chemical was obtained as T > B > E > X. The blend had the most emission among oils, followed by, in descending order, corn, sunflower, and canola. In association with environmental effects, the orders of X > T > E > B and T ∼ E > X > B were obtained for OFP and SOA, respectively. THQ for blend, corn, canola, and sunflower oils was higher than 1 (1.76, 1.35, 1.27, and 1.002, respectively), showing a considerable n-CR when the hood was off. In this respect, TCR for the oils (1.78 × 10−4, 1.45 × 10−4, 1.39 × 10−4, and 1.05 × 10−4, respectively) shown the probable risk for all oils. Moreover, hood switching reduced the risk by about 11–81%.},

abstract = {Depressive symptoms have become a serious public health issue worldwide. Several studies showed that air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5), may be a risk factor of mental disorders. However, existing studies reported inconsistent results and little evidence is available in developing countries, like China. To fill the gap, in this study, we explored the relationship between ambient PM2.5 exposure and depressive symptoms among middle-aged and elderly Chinese adults in the Chinese Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). The social and demographic variables and depressive symptoms were obtained from the Wave4 of CHARLS in 2018. PM2.5 concentrations were obtained from the national urban air quality real-time release platform of China Environmental Monitoring Station. We applied generalized linear mixed models to determine the association between PM2.5 exposure and depressive symptoms. A total of 15,105 middle-aged and elderly adults from CHARLS Wave4 were included in the analyses. We found positive impact of ambient PM2.5 on depressive symptoms for the exposure windows of 30-day, 60-day, 120-day, 180-day, 1-year and 2-year. The most significant increase was observed for 180-day moving average. For every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increment in PM2.5 exposure, the incidence of depressive symptoms increased by 9% (OR = 1.09; 95%CI: 1.05, 1.14) after adjusting for age, sex and residence. In interaction analyses, we found PM2.5 had weaker effect on depressive symptoms among people who used to drink alcohol (OR = 1.05; 95%CI: 1.00, 1.10) and exercise (OR = 1.10; 95%CI: 1.02, 1.18). People living in western China (OR = 1.09; 95%CI: 1.03, 1.16) were more vulnerable than those living in eastern China (OR = 0.99; 95%CI: 0.94, 1.05). In conclusion, exposure to PM2.5 was significantly associated with depressive symptoms in middle-aged and elder Chinese adults, particularly for people who never drink, with lower physical activity levels, or lived in western China.},

Previous studies used ambient air pollutants as a proxy for individual exposure, limiting the assessment of its multiple exposure to health effects. For the first time, this study constructed individual PM2.5 component (SO42−, NO3−, NH4+, OM, and BC) exposure model DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), DAG-oriented generalized linear model and random forest model, and explored the effects of single and multiple exposures to PM2.5 components on BP at different stages by the generalized linear model (GLM) and Quantile g-Computation (QgC) model based on a large cohort study in China. We defined BP in four stages according to the 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines. After excluding the lack of key information, the cohort analyses ultimately included 9031 participants. Our results showed that the individual PM2.5 component exposure model had good efficacy. Single or multiple exposure to PM2.5 components had significant positive effects on normal BP to elevated BP and elevated BP to stage 1 HTN. In addition, males, the elderly and urban residents were more sensitive to PM2.5 components. This study provided implications for environmental exposure assessment and control of particulate pollution in the future.},

abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been linked to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, PM2.5 is a complex mixture with large spatiotemporal heterogeneities, and women with early-onset GDM (i.e., diagnosed before 24th gestation week) have distinct maternal characteristics and a higher risk of worse health outcomes compared with those with late-onset GDM (i.e., diagnosed in or after 24th gestation week). We aimed to examine differential impacts of PM2.5 and its constituents on early-vs. late-onset GDM, and to identify corresponding susceptible exposure windows. We leveraged statewide linked electronic health records and birth records data in Florida in 2012–2017. Exposures to PM2.5 and its constituents (i.e., sulfate [SO42−], ammonium [NH4+], nitrate [NO3−], organic matter [OM], black carbon [BC], mineral dust [DUST], and sea-salt [SS]) were spatiotemporally linked to pregnant women based on their residential histories. Cox proportional hazards models and multinomial logistic regression were used to examine the associations of PM2.5 and its constituents with GDM and its onsets. Distributed non-linear lag models were implemented to identify susceptible exposure windows. Exposures to PM2.5, SO42−, NH4+, and BC were statistically significantly associated with higher hazards of GDM. Exposures to PM2.5 during weeks 1–12 of gestation were positively associated with GDM. Associations of early-onset GDM with PM2.5 in the 1st and 2nd trimesters, SO42− in the 1st and 2nd trimesters, and NO3− in the preconception and 1st trimester were considerably stronger than observations for late-onset GDM. Our findings suggest there are differential associations of PM2.5 and its constituents with early-vs. late-onset GDM, with different susceptible exposure windows. This study helps better understand the impacts of air pollution on GDM accounting for its physiological heterogeneity.},

abstract = {The concentration of ozone (O3) in the environment is gradually increasing, but there are limited reports on the exposure to O3 during pregnancy on the risk of adverse birth outcomes. Our study aimed to examine the causal and independent effect of O3 exposure during pregnancy on the risk of preterm birth (PTB) and to identify the critical window. Based on the baseline population of the birth cohort in Jinan, northern China, we obtained the individual exposure for each subject during pregnancy of ambient 8-h moving average O3 through the inverse distance weighting model. The effect of O3 exposure during pregnancy on PTB was evaluated through the time-dependent Cox proportional-hazard models. And we assessed the causal relationship by controlling unknown confounding factors using the instrumental variable (IV) analysis, estimated the independent effect by principal component analysis, and identified the critical window period of exposure through the distributed lag model. Among 6501 subjects, 285 mothers delivered prematurely. The median (IQR) of O3 concentration during pregnancy was 109.51 (23.54) $\mu$g/m3. The high level of O3 exposure (>173.64 $\mu$g/m³) increased the risk of PTB, with HR of 1.92 (95% CI: 1.38–2.66). Furthermore, the HR (95% CI) of the O3 estimated value calculated by the IV (wind speed) on the risk of PTB was 2.63 (1.41–4.88). In addition, the high level of O3 exposure was associated with the risk of PTB in the 13th-18th gestational weeks. Therefore, the high level of O3 exposure during pregnancy may independently increase the risk of PTB, which may be a causal effect. The 13th to 18th week of gestation is a critical window for preventing this risk.},

Three hundred and twenty daily samples of PM0.1 and PM2.5 were collected at three different types of dwellings in Hanoi in two seasons, namely summer and winter. The samples were analyzed for 10 trace elements (TEs), namely Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Ni, Zn, As, Cd, Sn, and Pb. The daily average concentrations of indoor PM0.1 and PM2.5 in the city were in the ranges of 7.0–8.9 $\mu$g/m3 and 43.3–106 $\mu$g/m3, respectively. The average concentrations of TEs bound to indoor PM ranged from 66.2 ng/m3 to 216 ng/m3 for PM0.1 and 391 ng/m3 to 2360 ng/m3 for PM2.5. Principle component analysis and enrichment factor were applied to identify the possible sources of indoor PM. Results showed that indoor PM2.5 was mainly derived from outdoor sources, whereas indoor PM0.1 was derived from indoor and outdoor sources. Domestic coal burning, industrial and traffic emissions were observed as outdoor sources, whereas household dust and indoor combustion were found as indoor sources. 80% of PM2.5 was deposited in the head airways, whereas 75% of PM0.1 was deposited in alveolar region. Monte Carlo simulation indicated that the intake of TEs in PM2.5 can lead to high carcinogenic risk for people over 60 years old and unacceptable non-carcinogenic risks for all ages at the roadside house in winter.},

abstract = {Background
Limited studies investigated the association of prenatal exposure to PM2.5 and fetal growth measured by ultrasound with inconsistent results. No study evaluated the effect of PM2.5 constituents on fetal growth in utero. We aimed to investigated whether prenatal exposure to PM2.5 and its constituents was associated with fetal growth measured by ultrasound.
Methods
A total of 4319 eligible pregnant women in Peking University Birth Cohort in Tongzhou (PKUBC-T) were included in the study. Based on mothers' residential addresses, we estimated prenatal PM2.5 concentrations with a satellite-based spatiotemporal model and PM2.5 constituents concentrations with a modified Community Multiscale Air Quality model. Fetal growth parameters of abdominal circumference (AC), head circumference (HC), and femur length (FL) were measured by ultrasound and then estimated fetal weight (EFW) was calculated. We calculated sex and gestational age-specific fetal growth Z-score and then defined the corresponding fetal undergrowth. Generalized estimating equation was used to investigate the association of PM2.5 and its constituents with fetal growth Z-score and fetal undergrowth.
Results
Prenatal exposure to PM2.5, OC, EC, SO42−, NH4+, or NO3− was consistently associated with decreased Z-scores of fetal growth parameters (AC, HC, FL, EFW). One IQR increase of PM2.5, OC, EC, SO42−, NH4+, or NO3− was associated with −0.183 [95% confident interval (CI): −0.225, −0.141], −0.144 (95%CI: −0.181, −0.107), −0.123 (95%CI: −0.160, −0.085), −0.035 (95%CI: −0.055, −0.015), −0.095 (95%CI: −0.126, −0.064), and −0.124 (95%CI: −0.159, −0.088) decrease in EFW Z-score, respectively. Prenatal exposure to PM2.5, OC, EC, SO42−, NH4+, or NO3− was also associated with higher risk of fetal AC, HC, FL or EFW undergrowth.
Conclusion
The study identified that prenatal exposure to PM2.5 or its constituents was associated with impaired fetal growth. The findings provided evidence that control measures for PM2.5 constituents should be implemented for further promoting fetal growth.},

abstract = {Cooking is an important source of indoor emissions, and exposure to cooking emissions can instigate adverse health effects. Oxidative potential (OP) is a good indicator for assessing health risk, but studies detecting the OP of cooking emissions are rare. In this paper, size-segregated samples were collected at four sites in the canteen to study the chemical characteristics and OP of particulate matter (PM) emitted from cooking. The four sites were set to study the effects of different cooking styles and kitchen types. The results showed that the concentrations of most metals, water-soluble ions, PAHs, and OP at four sites followed the trend: deep-frying > stir-frying > second floor hall > first floor hall. And the concentration at the fine fraction (PM0.056-3.2) was much higher than that at coarse fraction (PM3.2-18). The PM OP at four sites were 1.1642 nmol m−3{\textperiodcentered}min−1, 1.2088 nmol m−3{\textperiodcentered}min−1, 0.8589 nmol m−3{\textperiodcentered}min−1 and 0.9507 nmol m−3{\textperiodcentered}min−1, respectively. The correlation between OP and other components showed that Zn (|r| = 0.444) and DBA (|r| = 0.507) were moderately related to OP, which suggested that heavy metals and PAHs might be contributed to PM OP. The carcinogenic risk assessments of heavy metals and PAHs showed that, there might be an increasing of potential carcinogenic risk if exposure to cooking environment for lifetime. Our results were firstly helpful for PM characteristics researches on cooking emissions, and also significant to public health protection, especially for people who usually cook.},

However, no study has investigated this effect in pre-pregnancy impaired fasting glucose (IFG) women. This study aimed to differentiate the effects of maternal PM2.5 exposure on PTB between pre-pregnancy IFG and normoglycemia women, and to further identify the susceptible window. This cohort study was conducted between January 2014 and December 2017 in 21 Chinese cities. All the recruited women received pre-pregnancy fasting serum glucose (FSG) tests and were followed up for their delivery outcomes. The PM2.5 exposures were estimated by the daily air pollution concentrations of the nearby monitors. Women with FSG below 7.0 mmol/L were included in the analysis. We employed the Cox proportional hazards models to examine whether PM2.5 exposure was associated with PTB. 237957 women were included and 7055 (3.0%) of them were pre-pregnancy IFG. During the entire pregnancy, we found 24.1% (HR = 1.241; 95% CI: 1.069, 1.439), 61.8% (HR = 1.618; 95% CI: 1.311, 1.997) and 18.6% (HR = 1.186; 95% CI: 1.004, 1.402) of increases in risk for all PTB, early PTB (20–33 gestational weeks) and late PTB (34–36 gestational weeks) among the pre-pregnancy IFG women, and 15.9% (HR = 1.159; 95% CI: 1.127, 1.192), 33.9% (HR = 1.339; 95% CI: 1.255, 1.430) and 13.2% (HR = 1.132; 95% CI: 1.098, 1.168) of increases in risk for all PTB, early PTB and late PTB among the normoglycemia women, with each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increment of PM2.5 exposure, respectively. Furthermore, PM2.5 exposure had the strongest effect on all PTB during trimester 1 (0–12 gestational weeks) among the pre-pregnancy IFG women, compared with the less strong effect during trimester 1 among the normoglycemia women. In conclusion, pre-pregnancy IFG increases the risk of PTB attributed to PM2.5, especially during trimester 1. Moreover, the effects of PM2.5 are greater on early PTB than late PTB for both pre-pregnancy IFG and normoglycemia women.},

abstract = {Worldwide epidemiological studies indicate that the adverse health effects associated with ozone exposure might be modified by ambient temperature. In China, the health risks associated with ozone exposure are poorly understood due to the lack of data. In addition, it is insufficient how temperature modifies the ozone exposure-cardiovascular mortality association. In this study, we adopted two advanced time-series Poisson generalized additive models (GAMs) including a nonparametric bivariate response surface model and a stratification parametric model to investigate the modification effect of temperature on ozone-related cardiovascular mortality in 13 cities in China from 2014 to 2016. We categorized temperature into three levels (low, moderate, and high) considering four temperature percentiles, including the 25th and 75th, 15th and 85th, 10th and 90th, and 5th and 95th temperature percentiles. Subsequently, under different temperature stratifications, we evaluated acute cardiovascular mortality risks associated with the maximum 8-h average ozone concentration (O3-8hmax) in each city and assessed these O3-8hmax-cardiovascular mortality associations by meta-analysis in all cities together. The results confirmed that high temperature strongly increased the O3-8hmax cardiovascular mortality association; in particular, the O3-8hmax mortality risk was highest when the 95th temperature percentile cut-off was applied. On days with daily mean temperatures exceeding the city-specific 75th, 85th, 90th, and 95th percentiles, a 10-$\mu$g/m3 increase in the O3-8hmax during the current and previous day (lag01) increased the cardiovascular mortality risk by 0.74%, 0.76%, 0.80%, and 1.11%, respectively. However, the O3-8hmax mortality risk did not change appreciably under moderate or cold temperature conditions defined by different temperature cut-offs. Our findings validate the theory that high temperature increases health risks associated with the O3-8hmax; thus, mitigating ozone exposure will be of utmost importance, especially under the context of a changing climate.},

We explored the association between maternal exposure to ambient PM2.5 and inflammation in placental villus of 114 women with clinically recognized early pregnancy loss (CREPL) and 114 women with normal early pregnancy (NEP). Temporally-adjusted land use regression models were used to estimate maternal daily PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy. Villus interleukin-1beta (IL-1$\beta$), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) were measured using multiplex cytokines detection platform. Single-day lag effect of PM2.5 exposure within ten days before early placental villus collection was estimated using multivariable linear regression model. Distributed lag and net cumulative effects of PM2.5 exposures within ten and 30 days before villus collection, as well as five single weeks during the periovulatory period, were estimated using distributed lag non-linear models. In all 228 subjects, after adjusting for group (CREPL or NEP), temporal confounders, and demographic characteristics, both single-day and distributed lag effects of PM2.5 exposure at lag 8 significantly increased villus IL-6; distributed lag effects of PM2.5 exposure in the first and second weeks before ovulation increased IL-1$\beta$, and PM2.5 exposure in the third week after ovulation increased IL-6 and TNF-$\alpha$. In CREPL, single-day lag effect significantly increased IL-1$\beta$ (at lag 1), IL-6 (at lag 8), and TNF-$\alpha$ (at lag 5); distributed lag effect increased IL-6 (at lag 4–lag 8) and TNF-$\alpha$ (at lag 4–lag 6); and cumulative effect within ten days before villus collection increased IL-6. There was no statistically significant cumulative effect in NEP. In summary, maternal PM2.5 exposure was associated with placental inflammation in human early pregnancy, particularly with increased villus IL-6 in CREPL. Whether maternal–fetal interface inflammation related to PM2.5 exposure during the periovulatory period or later contributes to CREPL or other adverse pregnancy outcomes requires further study.},

However, this research topic has long been overlooked. This study aimed to examine the spatiotemporal variability in ambient respirable PM (PM10) components associated inhalation carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk (ICR and INCR) in Hong Kong over 2015–2019. The land-use regression (LUR) approach was adopted to predict the spatial distribution of PM10 component concentrations for the period of 2015–2019, whereas the ICR and INCR values of PM10 components were also estimated using the classic health risk assessment method. Both concentration of PM10 and INCR of PM10 components showed a general decreasing trend, while ICR of PM10 components increased slightly over the study period. LUR-model-based spatial maps at 500 m × 500 m resolution revealed the important spatial variability in PM10 and its eleven components, and their associated ICR and INCR values. High pollution levels and high ICR and INCR of studied PM10 components were generally found in developed urban areas and along the road network. Despite the fact that the PM10 concentrations met the Hong Kong annual PM10 air quality objective of 50 $\mu$g/m3, there was still significant potential health risk from the studied PM10 components. This study highlights the importance of taking PM component concentrations and associated inhalation health risk as well as PM mass concentrations into account for the perspective of air quality management and protecting public health.},

Wheezing is one of the most common symptoms when diagnosing of asthma; thus, we investigated the associations of O3 exposure before and during pregnancy with wheezing in preschool children and the potential susceptible exposure windows from a heavily polluted city in China. This population-based birth cohort study, which included 3725 mother-child pairs from Guangzhou, began in 2016, and the follow-up period ended on July 31, 2020. We used a spatiotemporal land-use-regression model combined with activity patterns to estimate the daily O3 exposure levels during the pre-pregnancy period and each trimester, and wheezing was recorded by reviewing medical records. We used the Cox proportional hazard model to quantify the effects of O3 exposure on childhood wheezing adjusted for potential confounders. No significant association was detected between pre-pregnancy exposure to O3 and childhood wheezing. However, increased ambient O3 exposures throughout pregnancy and in the second trimester were positively associated with the risk of childhood wheezing, with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confident intervals (CIs) per interquartile range (IQR) increment of 1.22 (95% CI: 1.04–1.44) and 1.31 (95% CI: 1.09–1.58), respectively. The effects of maternal O3 exposure on childhood wheezing risk was stronger when the exposure occurred in the warm conception season (P < 0.05). Significant childhood wheezing risk could be attributable to maternal O3 exposure, especially during the second trimester and with warm-season conception in Guangzhou. Further cohorts of children, particularly school age children who have more robust asthma diagnoses, should be investigated in the future.},

abstract = {Background
No study has explored the effects of sustained maternal exposure to high-level ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) within a short period, i.e., PM2.5 wave, on adverse birth outcomes, though increasing epidemiological studies demonstrated that exposure to single days of high ambient PM2.5 could increase risks of adverse birth outcomes. In this study, we aim to evaluate associations of maternal PM2.5 wave exposure around pregnancy with preterm birth (PTB), small for gestational age (SGA), and large for gestational age (LGA).
Methods
Totally 10,916 singleton pregnant women from all 16 districts in Tianjin, China, and their followed-up birth outcomes were included in this study. We defined PM2.5 wave as at least 2 consecutive days with daily average PM2.5 concentration exceeding 75 $\mu$g/m3, and 90th, 92.5th, 95th, 97.5th, 99th percentiles of PM2.5 distribution during the study period in Tianjin, respectively. Cox proportional hazard model was applied to evaluate the durational effects of PM2.5 wave during each exposure window on PTB, SGA, and LGA after adjusting for potential confounders.
Results
Exposure to PM2.5 wave over the preconception and pregnancy periods was associated with increased risks of adverse birth outcomes. For PTB, the strongest association was found during the first trimester when PM2.5 wave was defined as at least 4 consecutive days with daily average PM2.5 concentration >90th (HR, 10.46; 95% CI, 6.23–17.54); and for SGA (HR, 6.23; 95% CI, 3.34–11.64) and LGA (HR, 4.70; 95% CI, 3.35–6.59), the strongest associations both were found when PM2.5 wave was defined as at least 2 consecutive days with daily average PM2.5 concentration >99th. Additionally, the risks of adverse birth outcomes generally increased at higher PM2.5 thresholds or longer durations of PM2.5 wave.
Conclusion
Prolonged exposure to high-level PM2.5 over preconception and pregnancy periods was associated with increasing risks of PTB, SGA and LGA.},

This study aims to examine the association between short-term exposure to ambient PM1 on BP in children and adolescents. Population data were obtained from a large cross-sectional survey from 102 schools in Shandong Province, China. Daily air pollution data were collected, and individual exposure level was assigned based on coordinates of school addresses. Distributed lag non-linear models incorporated with a linear mixed model were used. A total of 35241 students aged 9–18 years were included in the study, and the mean values of PM1, particle matters with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), and ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10) at the schools during the study period were 50.8 (SD = 7.2) $\mu$g/m3, 75.5 (SD = 14.7) $\mu$g/m3, and 138.9 (SD = 25.9) $\mu$g/m3, respectively. We found that per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increment in a cumulative exposure of PM1 at lag 0 and lag 1 day was significantly associated with a higher systolic BP (SBP, $\beta$ = 1.46 mmHg), diastolic BP (DBP, $\beta$ = 1.20 mmHg, 95% CI = 0.52 to 1.88), mean arterial pressure (MAP, $\beta$ = 1.28 mmHg, 95% CI = 0.61 to 1.96), and pulse pressure (PP, $\beta$ = 0.65 mmHg, 95% CI = 0.14 to 1.16), after adjusting for other air pollutants and individual covariates (including sex, age, BMI, residence, month of the survey, intake of eggs, intake of milk, physical activity, and screen time). The above associations were stronger in magnitude than for PM2.5- and PM10-related associations. The associations of PM1 with SBP, DBP, MAP, and PP were stronger among females, younger children, those overweight or obese, and those with insufficient physical activity levels. In conclusion, the susceptible window of short-term exposure to ambient PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 on BP levels for children and adolescents are lag 0 and lag 1 day, with PM1 exhibiting a stronger association. Future interventions should be conducted to reduce the impact of PM exposure, especially PM1, on health in children and adolescents.},

Low birth weight is associated with increased risks of health problems in infancy and later life. Among the epidemiological analyses suggesting an association between air pollution and birth weight, few have estimated the effects of black carbon (BC) or together with nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and even fewer studies have used causal modelling.
Methods
We examined 1,119,011 birth records between 2001/01/01 and 2015/12/31 from the Massachusetts Birth Registry to investigate causal associations between prenatal exposure to BC and NO2 and birth weight. We calculated mean residential BC and NO2 exposures 0–30, and 31–280 days prior to birth from validated spatial-temporal models. We fit generalized propensity score models with gradient boosting tuned by a new algorithm to achieve covariate balance, then fit marginal structural models with stabilized inverse-probability weights.
Results
Throughout pregnancy, the average birth weight would drop by 17.0 g (95% CI: 15.4, 18.6) for an IQR increase of 0.14 $\mu$g/m3 in BC and would independently drop by 19.9 g (95% CI: 18.6, 21.3) for an IQR increase of 9.8 ppb in NO2. Most of the negative effects of BC on birth weight are from 0 to 30 days before the delivery date. The estimated odds ratio of low birth weight for every IQR increase during the entire pregnancy was 1.131 (95% CI: 1.106, 1.156) for BC and 1.082 (95% CI: 1.062, 1.103) for NO2.
Conclusions
We found that prenatal exposures to both BC and NO2 were associated with lower birth weight.},

Short-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 and PM10 is associated with increased risk of mortality and hospital admissions for stroke. However, there is less evidence regarding the effect of exposure to PM1 on stroke incidence. We estimated the incidence risk of stroke and the attributable fractions related to short-term exposure to ambient PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 in China.
Methods
County-specific incidence of stroke was obtained from health statistics in years 2014–2019. We linked county-level mean daily concentrations of PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 with stroke incidence. We used the time stratified case-crossover design to estimate the associations between stroke incidence and exposure to PM1, PM2.5 and PM10. We also estimated the disease burden fractions attributable to PM1, PM2.5, and PM10.
Results
The study included a total of 2,193,954 stroke, from which 1,861,331 were ischemic and 332,623 were hemorrhagic stroke. PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 levels were associated with increased risks of total stroke and ischemic stroke at when assessing the associations in exposure at lag0−4 days. The increase of 10 $\mu$g/m3 in PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 was associated with total stroke, and the relative risks were 1.012 (95% confidence interval: 1.008, 1.015), 1.006 (1.004, 1.007) and 1.003 (1.002, 1.004), while the associations with ischemic stroke were 1.013 (1.010, 1.017), 1.006 (1.005, 1.008) and 1.003 (1.002, 1.004), respectively. There was no significant association between PM and risk of hemorrhagic stroke. The attributable fractions of total stroke were 6.9% (5.1%, 8.5%), 5.6% (4.2%, 6.8%) and 5.6% (3.9%, 7.1%) for PM1, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively.
Conclusions
PM1 showed a stronger association with stroke, with a larger attributable fraction of outcomes, than PM2.5 and PM10. Clean air policies should target the whole scope of PM, including PM1.},

abstract = {Construction workers on highway rehabilitation projects can be exposed to a combination of traffic- and construction-related emissions. To assess the personal exposure a worker experiences, a portable battery-operated Air Quality Device (AQD) was utilised to measure emissions during normal construction operations of a major road rehabilitation project. Emissions measured were nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOCs) and Particulate Matter (PM10, PM2.5, and PM1). The objective of the paper is to document the hazardous emissions that construction workers may be exposed to and allow for a basis of informed decision making to mitigate the risks of a road construction project. Most critically, this article is designed to raise awareness of the potential impact to a worker's wellbeing as well as highlight the need for further research. Through statistical analysis, asphalt paving was identified as the most hazardous activity in terms of exposure relative to other activities. This activity was further assessed using discrete-time Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations with results indicating a high probability that workers may be exposed to greater hazardous emission concentrations than measured. Limiting the distance to the source of emissions, large-scale use of warm-mix asphalt and reducing the idling times of construction vehicles were identified as practical mitigation measures to reduce exposure and aid in achieving zero-harm objectives. Finally, it is found that males are more susceptible to long-term implications of hazardous emission inhalation and should be more aware if the scenarios they might work in expose them to this.},

PM2.5 have been associated with weight change in animal models and non-pregnant populations. Evidence of associations between PM2.5 and gestational weight gain (GWG), an important determinant of course and outcomes of pregnancy, and subsequent birth outcomes is limited.
Methods
The study was conducted among a subset of participants from the Omega Study, a prospective pregnancy cohort. Exposure to PM2.5 ($\mu$g/m3) was ascertained for participants (N = 855) based on their residential address using a validated national spatiotemporal model. Adjusted multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate associations of trimester-specific and pregnancy-month PM2.5 exposures with early (<20 weeks gestation), late (≥20 weeks gestation), and total GWG and infant birth weight. Stratified models and product terms were used to examine whether pre-pregnancy BMI (ppBMI) and infant sex modified the associations.
Results
Average monthly PM2.5 exposure during the first, second, and third trimesters were 7.3 $\mu$g/m3, 7.9 $\mu$g/m3, and 7.7 $\mu$g/m3, respectively. Higher third trimester PM2.5 exposure was associated with higher late (0.40 kg per 5 $\mu$g/m (McDowell et al., 2018); 95%CI: 0.12, 0.67) and total (0.35 kg; 95%CI: 0.01, 0.70) GWG among participants with normal ppBMI. Higher second month PM2.5 exposure was associated with lower early (−0.70 kg; 95%CI: 1.22, −0.18), late (−0.84 kg; 95% CI: 1.54, −0.14), and total (−1.70 kg; 95%CI: 2.57, −0.82) GWG among participants with overweight/obese ppBMI. Product terms between PM2.5 and ppBMI were significant for second month PM2.5 exposure and early (p-value = 0.01) and total GWG (p-value<0.01). Higher third trimester PM2.5 exposure was associated with higher birth weight, though higher fourth month PM2.5 exposure was associated with lower birth weight, particularly among those with normal ppBMI and male infants.
Conclusions
Associations of PM2.5 with GWG vary by exposure window and ppBMI, while associations of PM2.5 with birth weight potentially vary by exposure window, ppBMI and infant sex. Further exploration of associations between PM2.5 and maternal/child health outcomes are needed.},

As a consequence, these compounds are frequently detected in the environment, as well as human bodily fluids, especially umbilical cord blood and breast milk. This has raised awareness of their potential risks to fetuses and infants. In this study, we employed human embryonic stem cell differentiation models to assess the potential developmental toxicity of six TBBPA-like compounds, at human relevant nanomolar concentrations. To mimic early embryonic development, we utilized embryoid body-based 3D differentiation in presence of the six HFRs. Transcriptomics data showed that HFR exposure over 16 days of differentiation only interfered with the expression of a few genes, indicating those six HFRs may not have specific tissue/organ targets during embryonic development. Nevertheless, further analyses revealed that some cardiac-related genes were dysregulated. Since the heart is also the first organ to develop, we employed a cardiac differentiation model to analyze the six HFRs' potential developmental toxicity in more depth. Overall, HFRs of interest did not significantly disturb the canonical WNT pathway, which is an essential signal transduction pathway for cardiac development. In addition, the six HFRs showed only mild changes in gene expression levels for cardiomyocyte markers, such as NKX2.5, MYH7, and MYL4, as well as a significant down-regulation of some but not all the epicardial and smooth muscle cell markers selected. Taken together, our results show that the six studied HFRs, at human relevant concentrations, may impose negligible effects on embryogenesis and heart development. Nevertheless, higher exposure doses might affect the early stages of heart development.},

Several attempts have been made to do this, each requiring different assumptions. These include the Log−Linear(LL), IntegratedExposure−Response(IER), and GlobalExposureMortalityModel(GEMM). In this paper we develop an improved relative risk model suitable for use in health benefits analysis that incorporates features of existing models while addressing limitations in each model. We model the derivative of the relative risk function within a meta-analytic framework; a quantity directly applicable to benefits analysis, incorporating a Fusion of algebraic functions used in previous models. We assume a constant derivative in concentration over low exposures, like the LL model, a declining derivative over moderate exposures observed in cohort studies, and a derivative declining as the inverse of concentration over high global exposures in a similar manner to the GEMM. The model properties are illustrated with examples of fitting it to data for the six specific causes of death previously examined by the GlobalBurdenofDisease program with ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5). In a test case analysis assuming a 1% (benefits analysis) or 100% (burden analysis), reduction in country-specific fine particulate matter concentrations, corresponding estimated global attributable deaths using the Fusion model were found to lie between those of the IER and LL models, with the GEMM estimates similar to those based on the LL model.},

The placenta regulates fetal growth and influences postnatal development via fetal programming. Placental gene expression may be influenced by intrauterine exposures to PM2.5. Herein, we explore whether maternal PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy alters placental gene expression related to lipid and glucose metabolism in a U.S. birth cohort, the Rhode Island Child Health Study (RICHS). Average PM2.5 exposure level was estimated linking residential addresses and satellite data across the three trimesters using spatio-temporal models. Based on Gene Ontology annotations, we curated a list of 657 lipid and glucose metabolism genes. We conducted a two-staged analysis by leveraging placental RNA-Seq data from 148 subjects to identify top dysregulated metabolic genes associated with PM2.5 (Phase I) and then validated the results in placental samples from 415 participants of the cohort using RT-qPCR (Phase II). Associations between PM2.5 and placental gene expression were explored using multivariable linear regression models in the overall population and in sex-stratified analyses. The average level of PM2.5 exposure across pregnancy was 8.0$\mu$g/m3, which is below the national standard of 12$\mu$g/m3. Phase I revealed that expression levels of 32 out of the curated list of 657 genes were significantly associated with PM2.5 exposure (FDR P<0.01), 28 genes showed differential expression modified by sex of the infant. Five of these genes (ABHD3, ATP11A, CLTCL1, ST6GALNAC4 and PSCA) were validated using RT-qPCR. Associations were stronger in placentas from male births compared to females, indicating a sex-dependent effect. These genes are involved in inflammation, lipid transport, cell-cell communication or cell invasion. Our results suggest that gestational PM2.5 exposure may alter placental metabolic function. However, whether it confers long-term programming effects postnatally, especially in a sex-specific matter, warrants further studies.},

abstract = {The diurnal variation, gas-particle partitioning, health risks, and sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were investigated in a northern basin city of China in winter, 2020. The mean concentrations of particulate and gaseous PAHs were 87.90 ng m−3 and 69.65 ng m−3, respectively, and their concentrations were considerably enhanced during the domestic heating period. The relationship between the gas-particle partitioning coefficient of PAHs (KP) and subcooled liquid vapor pressure of PAHs (PL0) indicated organic absorption as the mechanism for this partitioning. However, the dual sorption model confirmed adsorption onto elemental carbon (EC). The health risks indicated by several equivalent parameters showed an important health effect of PAHs, especially of particulate PAHs bound onto PM2.5 during the heating period. Environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) were also studied as an auxiliary parameter to evaluate the health impact of PAHs. According to the diagnostic ratios of PAHs and PMF model results, petroleum volatilization and coal combustion were the dominant sources of particulate PAHs during the non-heating and heating periods, respectively. The source apportionment results can help efficiently control PAHs and their health risks.},

TCDD is a known human carcinogen, but few studies investigated about the effects of exposure to both compounds, i.e., whether BDE-209 and TCDD can render tumor cells more aggressive and metastatic. In the current study we investigated if the exposure of B16–F1 and B16–F10 melanoma murine cells to environmental relevant concentrations of TCDD and BDE-209 at 24 h and 15-day exposure modulates the expression of genes related to metastasis, making the cells more aggressive. Both pollutants did not affect cell viability but lead to increase of cell proliferation, including the upregulation of vimentin, MMP2, MMP9, MMP14 and PGK1 gene expression and downregulation of E-cadherin, TIMP2, TIMP3 and RECK, strongly suggesting changes in cell phenotypes defined as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in BDE-209 and TCDD-exposed cells. Foremost, increased expression of metalloproteinases and decreased expression of their inhibitors made B16–F1 cells similar the more aggressive B16–F10 cell line. Also, the higher secretion of extracellular vesicles by cells after acute exposure to BDE-209 could be related with the phenotype changes. These results are a strong indication of the potential of BDE-209 and TCDD to modulate cell phenotype, leading to a more aggressive profile.},

We were interested in the involved atmospheric particulates-bound PAHs regarding their sources, cancer risk, and related cellular toxicity for those in other areas under comparable conditions. In this study, the daily concentrations of TSP, PM10, and PM2.5 were averaged 127.95, 95.91, and 67.62 $\mu$g/m3, and the bound PAHs were averaged 1.31, 1.22, and 0.77 ng/m3 in summer and 12.72, 20.51 and 40.27 ng/m3 in winter, respectively. The dominant PAHs were those with 5–6 rings, and 4–6 rings in summer and winter, respectively. The incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) (90th percentile probability) of total PAHs was above 1.00E-06 in each age group, particularly high in adolescents. Sensitivity analysis indicated that slope factor and body weight had greater impact than exposure duration and inhalation rate on the ILCR. Moreover, treatment of human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells with mixed five indicative PAHs increased the formation of ROS, DNA damage (elevation in $\gamma$-H2AX), and protein levels of CAR, PXR, CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1, while reduced the AhR protein, with the winter mixture more potent than summer. For the sources of PAHs, the stable carbon isotope ratio analysis and diagnostic ratios consistently pointed to petroleum and fossil fuel combustion as major sources. In conclusion, our findings suggest that particulates-bound PAHs deserve serious concerns for a cancer risk in such environment, and the development of new power sources for reducing fossil fuel combustion is highly encouraged.},

However, few studies have explored the influence of PM2.5 and its constituents on Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), an established risk factor for hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly in severely air-polluted areas. To explore the potential impact of PM2.5 constituents on BP, plasma hormones, and TMAO, a panel study was conducted to investigate changes in BP, plasma hormones, and TMAO in response to ambient air pollution exposure in stage 1 hypertensive young adults. Linear mixed effect models were used to estimate the cumulative effects of fine particulate matters (PM2.5) and its constituents on BP, plasma hormones and TMAO. We found that one interquartile range (IQR) (35 $\mu$g/m3) increase in 0–1 day moving-average PM2.5 concentrations was statistically significantly associated with elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) with estimated values of 0.13 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03 to 0.23) mmHg, 0.18 (95% CI: 0.08 to 0.28) mmHg, and 0.17 (95% CI: 0.09 to 0.26) mmHg, respectively. Hormone disturbance in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was also associated with PM2.5 exposure. Elevated TMAO levels with an IQR increase for 0–4, 0–5, 0–6 moving-average concentrations of PM2.5 were found, and the increased values ranged from 26.28 (95% CI: 2.92 to 49.64) to 60.78 (31.95–89.61) ng/ml. More importantly, the PM2.5-bound metal constituents, such as manganese (Mn), titanium (Ti), and selenium (Se) showed robust associations with elevated BP and plasma TMAO levels. This study demonstrates associations between PM2.5 metal constituents and increased BP, changes in plasma hormones and TMAO, in stage 1 hypertensive young adults. Source control, aiming to reduce the emission of PM2.5-bound metals should be implemented to reduce the risk of hypertension and CVD.},

abstract = {In conventional subway cars, the fully mixed ventilation mode leads to airflow cross-contamination. To improve the air quality in subway cars in the post-pandemic period, we analyzed the pollutant concentrations in the subway cars of the Ningbo Rail Transit Line 2. Our results revealed that the CO2 levels in these subway cars exceeded the health standards during peak hours in the morning and evening, with two peaks in the concentration of pollutants along the height of the subway cars. Therefore, we propose a stratum ventilation technology for subway cars to mitigate the stratification of pollutants. Computational fluid dynamics was used to compare the flow field characteristics and pollutant diffusion trajectories in conventional subway cars and those with stratum ventilation. Our observations indicate that subway cars with stratum ventilation enable the formation of an air curtain in the middle of the car, effectively improving air quality within the breathing area of the seated passengers. In addition, the Wells-Riley model for predicting airborne infection was improved by incorporating pollutant concentration as a variable; this enabled the prediction of the probability of pathogenic infection with any pollutant concentration in a confined space. The results of this model revealed that, in a two-passenger mode ¼ subway car, stratum ventilation technology reduces the probability of pathogenic infection among the seated passengers from 25.4% to 3.07%, as compared to conventional subway cars. We believe the present research will help improve the safety performance of ventilation design.},

abstract = {Background
Although particulate matter is a known carcinogen, its association with childhood cancer is inconclusive. The present study aimed to examine the association between long-term exposure to particulate matter and childhood cancer.
Methods
A retrospective cohort was constructed from the claims database of the Korea National Health Insurance Service, including children born in seven metropolitan cities in Korea between 2002 and 2012. Monthly mean concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <10 $\mu$m (PM10) and other air pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO, and O3) were calculated using data from the AirKorea. Monthly mean concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) were estimated based on a data fusion approach. Cumulative exposure was assessed by averaging the monthly concentrations accounting for the residential mobility of the children. The occurrence of cancer was identified by the appearance of diagnosis codes in the claims database. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using Cox proportional regression, adjusting for potential confounders and O3 concentrations.
Results
During the study period, 1,725 patients were newly diagnosed with cancer among 1,261,855 children. HR of all cancers per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increment in annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were 3.02 (95% CI: 1.63, 5.59) and 1.04 (0.74, 1.45), respectively.
Conclusion
PM2.5 exposure was positively associated with childhood cancer in a large retrospective cohort with exposure assessment accounting for residential mobility.},

In this study, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) samples were collected at a rural site in Guanzhong Basin, Northwest China, in both summer (August 3–23, 2016) and winter (January 5–February 1, 2017). Then, human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells were exposed to the PM2.5, cultured for 24 h, and then assayed for particle-induced ROS and three inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$)) in vitro. The oxidative potential (OP) induced by winter PM2.5 samples was higher than that induced by summertime samples, whereas inflammatory values showed contrasting seasonal variations. Both OP and inflammatory factors were significantly correlated with most chemical compounds in winter, but not in summer, which was thought to be related mainly to the higher contribution from secondary aerosols formed during the warm season. Source apportionment results showed secondary aerosols formation have significant contribution to OP of PM2.5 in both seasons, but the dominant oxidation processes is different. Secondary nitrates-related process was the major contributors regulating the OP in winter; however, secondary sulfates formation were mainly responsible for the ROS responses in summer. For primary emission, biomass burning, rather than coal emission or vehicle exhaust, was the significant source for OP of PM2.5 in winter. In most cases, the source contribution of each inflammatory factor was similar to that of the ROS. Our results highlighted the significant health risk of atmospheric aerosols from biomass burning in the rural regions of Guanzhong Basin, Northwest China.},

A sum of 40 PAHs, including parent (p-PAHs), alkylated (a-PAHs), and oxygenated (o-PAHs) in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were quantified. The relationships between the PAHs and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also studied. The average total quantified PAHs concentration was 236.3 ± 48.3 ng m−3. The p-PAHs were found to be the most dominated group, accounting for an average of 88.1% of the total quantified PAHs, followed by a-PAHs (6.1%) and o-PAHs (5.8%). On the base of the number of aromatic rings, the groups of ≤5 rings (92.5 ± 1.2%) had higher fractions than the high ones (≥6 rings, 7.5 ± 1.2%) for pPAHs. Diurnal variations of PAHs subgroups exhibited the highest levels in Period III, consistent with the largest traffic counts in evening rush hours. However, less reduction of few PAHs in the night period demonstrates that the emissions of compressed natural gas (CNG) and methanol-fueled vehicles cannot be ignored while their contribution increased. High ROS activity levels were observed in the traffic-dominated samples, implying the potential oxidative damages to humans. Additionally, diurnal variation of the ROS activity was consistent with the total quantified PAHs and toxic equivalency of benzo[a]pyrene. Good correlations (R > 0.6, p < 0.05) were seen between individual groups of PAHs (especially for 3–5 rings p-PAHs, 4 rings a-PAHs, and 2–3 rings o-PAHs) and ROS activity, supporting that the vehicular emitted PAHs possibly initiate oxidative stress. The multiple linear regression analysis further illustrated that chrysene contributed the highest (25.0%) to ROS activity. In addition to highlighting the potential hazards to the PAHs from the vehicular emission, their roles to mitigate the health effects by formations of ROS were firstly reported in northwestern China.},

abstract = {As a widely used pure elemental carbon in colloidal particles, carbon black was listed as a group 2B carcinogen by IARC in 2010. The most available mechanism information about carbon black and carcinogenesis are from in vivo or in vitro studies. However, few studies concerned the nanoparticle's real-ambient exposure causing systemic change and further affecting the target organ. Herein, we used an ex vivo biosensor assay to investigate the transcriptome change of primary bronchial epithelial cells after treatment with the plasma from workers with long-term occupational carbon black exposure history. Based on ex vivo biosensor assay and transcriptome sequencing, we found the effect of internal systemic environment on epithelial cells after carbon black exposure was an inflammatory response, which mainly activates cell cycle-related pathways. After exposure to carbon black, the internal systemic environment could activate cancer-related pathways like epithelial-mesenchymal transition, hypoxia, TNF-$\alpha$ signaling via NF-$\kappa$B. The hub genes in the carbon black group (CDC20 and PLK1) and their correlation with the systemic environment were uncovered by constructing the protein-protein interaction network. Inflammatory cytokines, especially CRP, were strongly correlated with the expression of CDC20 and PLK1. Besides, we also find a strong correlation between CDC20 and cytokinesis-block micronucleus endpoints in peripheral blood (rho = 0.591, P < 0.001). Our results show that long-term carbon black exposure might activate cell cycle-related pathways through circulating inflammation and increase the risk of cancer, while the oxidative stress caused by diesel exhaust particles are mainly related to PAHs exposure. After exposure to carbon black, the systemic environment could activate cancer-related pathways like diesel exhaust particles, increasing the risk of lung cancer. These attempts might provide a further understanding of the indirect effect of chronic occupational inhaled carbon black exposure on pulmonary carcinogenesis.},

The health risk was assessed for the three exposure pathways (ingestion, inhalation and dermal contact) and for different age categories (newborns, children, adolescents, and adults). The non-carcinogenic risk calculated for the different species showed that benzene and n-heptane explained 78–94% of the total hazard index (HI) for NMVOCs at both sites. The total HI for NMVOCs varied between 2.9 and 26.8 at Zouk and between 0.8 and 6.6 at Fiaa for adults and newborns respectively exceeding the recommended USEPA limit of 1 for most age categories. PM2.5-bound elements had values higher than the recommended USEPA limit for newborns with Mn, Pb, V, and Ni as the major contributors. The other species under study presented moderate risk values. The lifetime cancer risk due only to the exposure to NMVOCs was 170 and 46 times higher than the threshold limit at Zouk and Fiaa, respectively. PM2.5-bound PAHs, As, Co, Cr(VI), Ni and V concentrations showed lifetime cancer risk exceeding the threshold limit of 10−6 with 58 and 28 additional cancer cases per million habitats at Zouk and Fiaa, respectively.

The on-site assessments of PSPs and individual HRV parameters of the volunteers were used to analyze the influence of size-fractionated PSPs and air purifier intervention on HRV at different lag times after PSPs exposure (0 min, 5 min, 15 min, and 30 min) by using the linear mixed-effects models. We observed that changes in 6 HRV parameters were associated with particle mass concentration (PMC) of PSPs, and changes in 8 HRV parameters were associated with particle number concentration (PNC) of PSPs. The sensitive HRV parameters were the square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals (rMSSD), NN50 count divided by the total number of all NN intervals (pNN50), normalized high frequency power (nHF), very high frequency power (VHF), normalized low frequency power (nLF), and the ratio of low frequency power to high frequency power (LF/HF). Most HRV parameters exhibited the strongest effect associated with PMC and PNC at a lag time of 30 min. The air purifier intervention markedly reduced the PNC and PMC of size-fractionated PSPs, enhanced 5 HRV parameters, and decreased the nLF and LF/HF. Our study suggests that short-term exposure to PSPs can affect HRV parameters, reflecting changes in cardiac autonomic nervous activity, and the use of an air purifier can reduce the concentration of PSPs and improve the autonomic nervous system activity of the exposed individuals.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of early childhood and early adolescent low-level lead exposure on early adolescent heart rate variability, a widely-used measure of physiological stress. Participants were 408 children from Jintan, China for whom blood lead levels were measured between 3 and 5 years (early childhood) and again at 12 years (early adolescence). Heart rate variability was assessed at 12 years while participants underwent an induced stress task utilizing the ratio of low to high frequency (LF/HF) ECG measures. Mean blood lead levels in the cohort were 6.63 mcg/dl and 3.10 mcg/dl at 3–5 years and 12 years, respectively. Blood lead levels at 3–5 years of age ($\beta$ 0.06, p = 0.027), but not at age 12 ($\beta$ −0.05, p = 0.465), were significantly associated with LF/HF measures while controlling for multiple sociodemographic variables, potentially reflecting a dysregulated stress response with a shift towards sympathetic dominance.

abstract = {Ambient particles with aerodynamic diameter <0.1 $\mu$m (PM0.1) have been suggested to have significant health impact. However, studies on the association between long-term PM0.1 exposure and human blood lipid metabolism are still limited. This study was aimed to evaluate such association based on multiple lipid biomarkers and dyslipidemia indicators. We matched the 2006–2009 average PM0.1 concentration simulated using the neural-network model following the WRF-Chem model with the clinical and questionnaire data of 15,477 adults randomly recruited from 33 communities in Northeast China in 2009. After controlling for social demographic and behavior confounders, we assessed the association of PM0.1 concentration with multiple lipid biomarkers and dyslipidemia indicators using generalized linear mixed-effect models. Effect modification by various social demographic and behavior factors was examined. We found that each interquartile range increase in PM0.1 concentration was associated with a 5.75 (95% Confidence interval, 3.24–8.25) mg/dl and a 6.05 (2.85–9.25) mg/dl increase in the serum level of total cholesterol and LDL-C, respectively. This increment was also associated with an odds ratio of 1.25 (1.10–1.42) for overall dyslipidemias, 1.41 (1.16, 1.73) for hypercholesterolemia, and 1.90 (1.39, 2.61) for hyperbetalipoproteinemia. Additionally, we found generally greater effect estimates among the younger participants and those with lower income or with certain behaviors such as high-fat diet. The deleterious effect of long-term PM0.1 exposure on lipid metabolism may make it an important toxic chemical to be targeted by future preventive strategies.},

abstract = {Emergency responses to the COVID-19 pandemic led to major changes in travel behaviours and economic activities in 2020. Machine learning provides a reliable approach for assessing the contribution of these changes to air quality. This study investigates impacts of health protection measures upon air pollution and traffic emissions and estimates health and economic impacts arising from these changes during two national ‘lockdown' periods in Oxford, UK. Air quality improvements were most marked during the first lockdown with reductions in observed NO2 concentrations of 38% (SD ± 24.0%) at roadside and 17% (SD ± 5.4%) at urban background locations. Observed changes in PM2.5, PM10 and O3 concentrations were not significant during first or second lockdown. Deweathering and detrending analyses revealed a 22% (SD ± 4.4%) reduction in roadside NO2 and 2% (SD ± 7.1%) at urban background with no significant changes in the second lockdown. Deweathered-detrended PM2.5 and O3 concentration changes were not significant, but PM10 increased in the second lockdown only. City centre traffic volume reduced by 69% and 38% in the first and second lockdown periods. Buses and passenger cars were the major contributors to NO2 emissions, with relative reductions of 56% and 77% respectively during the first lockdown, and less pronounced changes in the second lockdown. While car and bus NO2 emissions decreased during both lockdown periods, the overall contribution from buses increased relative to cars in the second lockdown. Sustained NO2 emissions reduction consistent with the first lockdown could prevent 48 lost life-years among the city population, with economic benefits of up to {\pounds}2.5 million. Our findings highlight the critical importance of decoupling emissions changes from meteorological influences to avoid overestimation of lockdown impacts and indicate targeted emissions control measures will be the most effective strategy for achieving air quality and public health benefits in this setting.},

abstract = {The short-term alteration of peripheral cytokines may be an early adverse health effect of PM2.5 exposure and may be further associated with cardiovascular disease. We conducted a randomized, double-blind crossover trial using true or sham air filtration among 54 healthy college students in Beijing to investigate the potential benefits of short-term indoor air filtration and the adverse health effects of time-weighted personal PM2.5 exposure through inflammatory cytokines. The participants randomly received true or sham air filtration intervention for a week, and the treatment was changed after a two-week washout period. Peripheral blood samples were collected after each intervention period to measure 38 inflammatory cytokines. A linear mixed-effects model was applied to estimate the impacts of air purification or a 10 $\mu$g/m3 PM2.5 exposure increase on cytokines. Lag effects of PM2.5 exposure were analyzed using single-day and moving average lag models. Air filtration reduced indoor and time-weighted average personal PM2.5 concentrations by 69.0% (from 33.6 to 10.4 $\mu$g/m3) and 40.3% (from 40.6 to 24.3 $\mu$g/m3), respectively. We observed a significant association of PM2.5 exposure with growth-regulated alpha protein (GRO-$\alpha$) of −11.3% (95%CI: 17.0%, −5.4%). In the lag models, significant associations between personal PM2.5 exposure and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1), and eotaxin were obtained at lag0, while associations with cytokines including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage inflammatory protein-1$\beta$ (MIP-1$\beta$), IL-4, tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$), and interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$) were noted at relatively long lagged exposure windows (lag5-lag6). No significant alteration in cytokines was observed under true air filtration intervention. Our study indicates the effectiveness of air filtration on indoor PM2.5 reduction. PM2.5 exposure may decrease GRO-$\alpha$ levels and change different cytokine levels time-varyingly. Further study is still needed to explore the mechanisms of PM2.5 exposure on the inflammatory response.},

Epidemiological studies indicate that NO2 exposure can aggravate placental senescence which is represented by fibrosis and abnormal telomere homeostasis, etc. In this study, pregnant C57BL/6 mice were exposed to NO2 (2.5 ppm, 5 h/day) daily in a dynamic exposure chamber throughout the gestation period, and were sacrificed at embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5), E15.5 and E18.5. Placenta were harvested and conducted for histopathological examination and telomere evaluation. Our results showed that gestational NO2 exposure significantly aggravated placental fibrosis and calcification, and up-regulated the related bio-markers (connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf) and transforming growth factor-$\beta$1 (Tgf-$\beta$1)) at E18.5. In addition, gestational exposure to NO2 also activated senescence related pathway (p53/p21) at E18.5. Furthermore, gestational NO2 exposure significantly shortened telomere length at E18.5, and the expression of telomere homeostasis regulation genes telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (Trf1), protection of telomeres 1a (Pot1a) and Pot1b were significantly increased while telomerase reverse transcriptase (Tert) was suppressed after NO2 exposure at E13.5 or E18.5, respectively. Importantly, DNA methylation status of the 22nd at E13.5 and 32nd at E18.5 site in sub-telomeric region of chromosome 1 was significantly altered. Based on the above results, our present study indicated that gestational NO2 exposure could lead to premature placental senescence during the late trimester of pregnancy via aggravation of fibrosis and telomere length shortening regulated by telomere regulatory enzyme and DNA methylation.},

We aimed to evaluate the association between exposure to petrochemical facilities and generated emissions during early life and the risk of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) development in children. We conducted a population-based birth cohort study using the 2004 to 2014 Taiwanese Birth Certificate Database and verified diagnoses of ADHD using the National Health Insurance Database. The level of petrochemical exposure in each participant's residential township was evaluated using the following 3 measurements: distance to the nearest petrochemical industrial plant (PIP), petrochemical exposure probability (accounting for monthly prevailing wind measurements), and monthly benzene concentrations estimated using kriging-based land-use regression models. We applied Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the association. During the study period, 48,854 out of 1,863,963 children were diagnosed as having ADHD. The results revealed that residents of townships in close proximity to PIPs (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16–1.23, <3 vs. ≥10 km), highly affected by petrochemical-containing prevailing winds (HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.08–1.16, ≥40% vs. <10%), and with high benzene concentrations (HR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.23–1.29, ≥0.75 vs. <0.55 ppb) were consistently associated with the increased risk of ADHD development in children. The findings of the sensitivity analysis remained robust, particularly for the 2004 to 2009 birth cohort and for models accounting for a longer duration of postnatal exposure. This work provided clear evidence that living near petrochemical plants increases the risk of ADHD development in children. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings.},

abstract = {Black carbon (BC) exposure in China continues to be relatively high, prompting researchers to assess BC exposure levels using data from monitoring sites, satellite remote sensing, and models. However, data regarding the application of a combined strategy comprising the analysis of monitoring data and various types of data to simulate BC exposure levels are lacking. Hence, the current study seeks to estimate short- and long-term BC exposure levels by combining national monitoring data with data from the second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2). Furthermore, this study attempts to improve the spatio-temporal resolution of BC exposure levels using Bayesian maximum entropy (BME). The BME model performed well in terms of estimating short- (R2 = 0.74 and RMSE = 1.76 $\mu$g/m3) and long-term (R2 = 0.76 and RMSE = 1.3 $\mu$g/m3) exposure. Premature mortalities and economic losses were also assessed by applying localised concentration–response coefficients simulated in China. A total of 74,500 (95% confidence interval (CI): 23,900–124,500) and 538,400 (95% CI: 495,000–581,300) all-cause premature mortality cases were found to be associated with short- and long-term BC exposure, respectively. Meanwhile, short-term BC exposure was associated with economic losses ranging from 7.5 to 13.2 billion US dollars (USD) (1 USD = 6.36 RMB on January 19, 2022) based on amended human capital (AHC) and willingness to pay (WTP), accounting for 0.06%–0.1% of China's total gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017 (1.2 × 104 billion USD), respectively. The economic losses for long-term exposure varied from 53 to 93.2 billion USD based on AHC and WTP, accounting for 0.4%–0.8% of China's total GDP in 2017, respectively.},

We investigated the association of exposure to PM2.5 during pregnancy and early life with ADHD. This birth cohort consisted of 425,736 singleton live-term births between 2004 and 2015 in Taiwan. Daily PM2.5 concentrations were derived from a 1-km satellite-based estimation model. A time-dependent Cox model was used to assess the effects of PM2.5 on ADHD during the first, second, and third trimesters and from age 1–5 years after birth. The distributed lag nonlinear model was utilized to explore the dose–response relationship. Total 9,294 children were diagnosed with ADHD during the study period. The hazard ratio (HR) of ADHD was significantly associated with a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 during the first trimester (HR = 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13–1.40) and increased at PM2.5 over 16 $\mu$g/m3. For postnatal periods, the HR of ADHD was significantly associated with increased PM2.5 at the first to third year of life (HR ranged between 1.40 and 1.87). According to the dose-response relationship of exposure to PM2.5 at the third year of life, the HR of ADHD was significantly associated with PM2.5 above 16 $\mu$g/m3 and sharply increased as PM2.5 >50 $\mu$g/m3. We did not observe a significant modification of sex on the relation between PM2.5 and ADHD. Exposure of pregnant women to PM2.5 above 16 $\mu$g/m3 from conception to the early life of their children may increase the risk of ADHD. The government should improve the criteria for air quality control and meet the WHO air quality guidelines to protect pregnant women and children from developing ADHD in the future.},

In this study, we specified and discriminated the short-term, seasonal and long-term trend effects of PM2.5 concentration on the hospitalisation for AECOPD in Beijing between 2010 and 2019. Daily PM2.5 observations from US Beijing Embassy from Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2019 (3652 days) were decomposed to short-term, seasonal and long-term trend components by using the robust Kolmogorov-Zurbenko filter. During the study period, daily counts of AECOPD hospitalisation were obtained from a database compiled by Beijing Public Health Information Center. Two separate generalized additive models were built to assess effects of raw PM2.5 concentrations and the three decomposed components of time-scales on hospitalisation of AECOPD in Beijing. We found raw PM2.5 concentrations were associated with AECOPD in Beijing with a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase corresponding to 0.46% (95% CI: 0.40%–0.52%) increase in hospitalisation. In the model of decomposed PM2.5 time-series, both the short-term and long-term components exhibited statistically significant positive association with AECOPD, which, respectively, was associated to 0.42% (95% CI: 0.36%–0.48%) and 6.91% (95% CI: 6.08%–7.74%) increase in AECOPD hospitalisation per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase. The seasonal trend had an insignificant U-shaped relationship with AECOPD. Our study simultaneously confirmed that a statistically significant positive association between the raw PM2.5 concentrations, the decomposed short-term and long-term trend of PM2.5 concentrations and increased risk for AECOPD hospitalisation. Strong long-term effects in this study indicated that stringent emission control measures would bring strong public health benefits concerning AECOPD.},

In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between solid fuel use and EBV seropositivity in a high-risk area of NPC. Our study was based on the baseline findings from an ongoing population-based prospective cohort in Sihui county in Southern China. We explored the association between current use of solid fuel in cooking and EBV seropositivity, and NPC-related EBV activation, using logistic regression models. Stratification analyses were further conducted to assess potential effect modifiers. We also examined the impact of frequency and duration of solid fuel use, and switch in fuel types, on EBV seropositivity among ever users. Of the 12,579 participants included in our analysis, 4088 (32.5%) were EBV seropositive and 421 (3.3%) were high risk for NPC-related EBV activation. Solid fuel use was associated with a higher risk of EBV seropositivity and NPC-related EBV activation, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.33 (95%CI: 1.01, 1.76) and 1.81 (95%CI: 1.03, 3.18), respectively. Higher risk of EBV seropositivity was observed for those who did not use ventilation apparatus and those who consumed salted food. Among ever users, OR was highest for participants with more than 40 years of solid fuel exposure (1.17, 95%CI: 1.00–1.37) and who have been constantly using solid fuel (1.30, 95%CI: 0.96–1.75). We did not find a statistically significant impact of cooking frequency on EBV seropositivity. The identification of solid fuel as a risk factor for EBV activation is of great value for understanding the etiology of NPC. Our findings also have important public health implications given the fact that a third of the global population still lack access to clean cooking, especially in low resource settings.},

abstract = {Although humans are generally exposed to second-hand smoke (SHS), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) exposure derived from SHS and its health hazard to non-smokers are rarely investigated. Thus, we examined the effects of SHS on VOCs exposure and oxidative stress damage via a passive smoking simulation experiment in 6 children and 7 adults. To further validate the studied urinary VOC metabolites as biomarkers for passive smoking, 259 children were recruited. The levels of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), malonaldehyde (MDA), trans-3′-hydroxycotinine (OH-Cot) and 31 VOC metabolites in urine were determined. The results showed that the geomean concentrations of 17 VOC metabolites in urine of children were 26.5%–138% higher than those of adults after passive smoking. The levels of urinary 8-OHdG, MDA and OH-Cot increased by 24.6%, 18.8% and 600% in children, but only 1.25%, 10.3% and 116% in adults, respectively. Therefore, children are more vulnerable to SHS than adults. After exposure to SHS, the levels of 8 urinary VOC metabolites of benzene, acrylonitrile, 1-bromopropane, propylene oxide, toluene, methyl methacrylate and cyanide increased by 60.9%–538% within 23 h. These 8 VOC metabolites were also significantly associated with 8-OHdG or MDA in urine (p < 0.01). Therefore, exposure to VOCs caused by SHS increases body oxidative stress damage. OH-Cot level higher than 2.00 $\mu$g/g Cr can be used as a threshold of passive smoking. The levels of urinary s-benzylmercapturic acid (BMA) and s-phenylmercapturic acid (PMA) in children increased by 494% and 728% within 6 h after passive smoking, respectively. Population validation study indicated that BMA and PMA levels were significantly elevated in children exposed to SHS. Therefore, in addition to OH-Cot, urinary BMA and PMA are potentially useful short-term biomarkers of passive smoking. Future studies should focus on the differences in VOC metabolism and detoxification mechanisms between children and adults.},

abstract = {Objectives
Under current global climate conditions, there are insufficient studies on the health influences of cold spells, especially on mental health. This study aimed to examine the effect of cold spells on schizophrenia admissions and to analyze the potential interaction effect with the air quality index (AQI).
Methods
Daily data on schizophrenia admissions and climatic variables in Hefei were collected from 2013 to 2019. Based on 20 definitions, the impacts of cold spells were quantified separately to find the most appropriate definition for the region, and meta-regression was used to explore the different effect sizes of the different days in a cold spell event. In addition, the potential interaction effect was tested by introducing a categorical variable, CSH, reflecting the cold spell and AQI level.
Results
The cold spell defined by temperature below the 6th centile while lasting for at least three days produced the optimum model fit performance. In general, the risk of schizophrenia admissions increased on cold spell days. The largest single-day effect occurred on the 12th day with RR = 1.081 (95% CI: 1.044, 1.118). In a single cold spell event, the effect of the 3rd and subsequent days of a cold spell (RR = 1.082, 95% CI: 1.036, 1.130) was higher than that on the 2nd day (RR = 1.054, 95% CI: 1.024, 1.085). Similarly, the effect of the 2nd day was also higher than that of the 1st day (RR = 1.027, 95% CI: 1.012, 1.042). We found a synergistic effect between cold spells and high AQI in the male group, and the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) was 0.018 (95% CI: 0.005–0.030).
Conclusions

abstract = {Background
Biomass fuel use for cooking is widespread in low to middle income countries. Studies on the association between biomass fuel use and cognitive abilities in children are limited.
Objective
To examine the association between biomass fuel use for cooking and cognitive abilities in Nepalese children at 4 years of age.
Methods
In a cohort design we have information on biomass fuel use in the households of 533 children in infancy and cognitive abilities when they were 4 years old from a community-based sample. Cognitive abilities were measured by the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, 4th edition (WPPSI-IV) and the NEPSY-II. We examined the associations between biomass fuel use and scores on the WPPSI-IV Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ) (primary outcome), and WPPSI index and NEPSY-II subtest scores in multiple linear regression models. The associations were also examined in predefined subgroups.
Results
Ninety-nine (18.6%) of the families used biomass fuel for cooking. Children in these families had lower mean FSIQ than children in families with no biomass use (83.3 (95%CI 81.7, 85.0) vs. 85.3 (95%CI 84.5, 86.0)), with a mean difference of −2.2 (95%CI -3.9, −0.5) adjusting for demographics and socio-economic status. The association between biomass fuel use and cognitive abilities was strongest in subgroups of children from households with more than three rooms, with separate kitchen and bedroom, and with higher wealth-score. These interactions were significant for number of rooms in the home (p = 0.04), if the household had separate bedroom and kitchen (p = 0.05), and for the wealth-score (p = 0.03).
Conclusion
Biomass fuel use for cooking in Nepalese families was associated with lower overall cognitive abilities at 4 years. Uncertainties include exposure misclassification and unmeasured confounding. The associations between biomass fuel use and neurodevelopment in children needs further investigation with more precise measurements of the exposure.},

In the present study, pregnant Balb/c mice were administered PCB52 (1 mg/kg BW/day) or corn oil vehicle by gavage until parturition. In the dams, PCB52 caused histopathological changes in the liver, higher serum levels of aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, and activated apoptosis and autophagy, suggesting hepatotoxicity. Overexpressed indicators of TLR4 pathway were observed in the liver of PCB52-exposed dams, indicated hepatic inflammation. Moreover, PCB52 exposure weakened the intestinal barrier and triggered inflammatory response, which might contribute to the hepatic inflammation by gut-liver axis. In the pups, prenatal PCB52 exposure affected the sex ratio at birth and reduced birth length and weights. Similar to the dams, prenatal PCB52 exposure induced hepatotoxicity in the pups without gender difference. Consistent with the alteration of gut microbiota, intestinal inflammation was confirmed, accompanying the disruption in the intestinal barrier and the activation of apoptosis and autophagy in the PCB52-exposed pups. Intestinal injury might be responsible for hepatotoxicity at least in part. Taken together, these findings suggested that gestational PCB52 exposure induced hepatic and intestinal injury in both maternal and offspring mice by arousing inflammation.},

We measured the levels of BTEX in the indoor and outdoor air of rural areas in Ardebil, Iran. We further assessed their health risks and determinants parameters. BTEX were sampled by drawing air through activated charcoal tubes, using low flow SKC pumps. Samples were extracted by adding carbon disulﬁde and analyzed by subjecting the aromatic fraction to GC-FID. The results indicated that the concentrations of BTEX in the indoor air were significantly higher than those of outdoor (p-value<0.05). The mean indoor concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene were 41.69 ± 30.70, 96.73 ± 60.75, 38.73 ± 33.59, and 59.42 ± 35.99 $\mu$g m−3, while the mean outdoor concentrations of them were 8.94 ± 7.32, 36.93 ± 21.82, 7.66 ± 5.63, and 18.14 ± 10.25 $\mu$g m−3, respectively. The concentrations of BTEX in indoor and outdoor of the rural areas that used kerosene fuel for heating systems were significantly higher than those used natural gas. The results indicated that the tobacco smoke is a notable temporary source of indoor BTEX. The mean inhalation lifetime cancer risk (LTCR) value of benzene for residents of rural houses with the natural gas and kerosene heating systems were 28.6 × 10−6 and 97.2 × 10−6, while for ethylbenzene these figures stood out at 29.1 × 10−6 and 95.8 × 10−6, respectively.

abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) exposure increased the risk of hospital admission and was related to symptoms of schizophrenia (SCZ). However, there are limited studies on the relationship between PM exposure and SCZ relapse risk, and the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. We designed an air purification intervention study under a 16-day real air purifier scenario and another 16-day sham air purifier scenario, with a 2-day washout period. Twenty-four chronic stable male patients were recruited. The oxidative stress biomarkers were measured including serum catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide (NO). The relapse risk was evaluated by the early signs scale (ESS). Linear mixed effect models were fitted to establish the associations between PM exposure and ESS and oxidative stress. Mediation model was performed to explore the mediation effect of oxidative stress on the PM-ESS association. Higher concentrations of PM2.5/PM10 exposure were associated with an elevated risk of relapse of SCZ. For each 10 $\mu$g/m3 in PM2.5 concentration, the scores of ESS and subscales of incipient psychosis (ESS-IP), depression/withdrawal (ESS-N), anxiety/agitation (ESS-A), and excitability/disinhibition (ESS-D) were increased by 4.112 (95% CI: 3.174, 5.050), 1.516 (95%CI: 1.178, 1.853), 1.143 (95%CI: 0.598, 1.689), 1.176 (95%CI: 0.727, 1.625) and 0.238 (95%CI: 0.013, 0.464), while logCAT, SOD and T-AOC were reduced by 0.039 U/ml (95% CI: 0.017, 0.060), 1.258 U/ml (95% CI: 0.541, 1.975), and 0.076 mmol/l (95% CI: 0.026, 0.126). In addition, pathways of “PM2.5→T-AOC→ESS-A″ and “PM2.5→T-AOC→ESS-D″ were found, with significant T-AOC mediated effects 15.70% (P = 0.02) and 52.99% (P = 0.04). Our findings suggest that PM may increase the risk of anxiety, depression, excitability, and incipient psychosis behaviors in SCZ patients, while reducing the function of the antioxidant system. The decrease of T-AOC may medicate the PM-ESS association in SCZ.},

Epidemiologic studies indicated that phthalate exposure might be associated with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, discrepancies existed. The link between phthalate exposure and risk of DM remained unclarified.
Methods
We conducted a meta-analysis to explore the association between phthalate exposure and risk of DM. Effects of phthalate exposure on insulin resistance were also evaluated by systematic review.
Results
Seven studies involving 12,139 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Our results showed that urinary concentrations of phthalates were positively associated with risk of DM. The pooled ORs were 3.11 (95% CI: 1.16–8.37) for monomethyl phthalate (MMP), 1.27 (95% CI: 1.03–1.56) for mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), 2.59 (95% CI: 1.10–6.10) for mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), 1.99 (95% CI: 1.52–2.61) for mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), 1.90 (95% CI: 1.40–2.57) for mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), 1.55 (95% CI: 1.10–2.20) for mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), and 2.39 (95% CI: 1.18–4.85) for mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), respectively. Molar summation of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites (∑DEHP) was also found to be correlated with risk of DM (OR 2.15, 95% CI: 1.48–3.13). No significant association with risk of DM was found regarding monoethyl phthalate (MEP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) and mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP). In literature review, most studies showed positive correlations of phthalates, especially ∑DEHP, with homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and fasting glucose.
Conclusion
Exposure to phthalates, especially MMP, MnBP, MiBP, MCPP and DEHP metabolites, might be a risk factor of DM. Our results should be interpreted with caution due to heterogeneous design of enrolled studies.},

abstract = {India's air quality is in a dismal state, with many studies ascribing it to PM2.5. Most of these corroborate that carbonaceous aerosol (CA) constitute significant fraction of PM2.5. However, investigations on the effect of long-term meteorological or emission changes on PM2.5 and its components, and their associated health effects are rare. In this work, WRF-Chem simulations for three seasons over four years (2016–2019) were carried out to cogitate the spatial and temporal changes in PM2.5 and its components in India. Model predicted PM2.5 concentrations were in good agreement with the ground-based observations for 25 cities. PM2.5 was highest in winter and lowest in pre-monsoon. PM2.5 reduced by ∼8% in Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) but increased by ∼38% and ∼130% in south and northeast India, respectively, from 2016 to 2019. IGP witnessed three times higher average PM2.5 concentrations than south India. No significant interannual change in CA contributions was observed, however, it peaked in the winter season. Other inorganics (OIN) were the major component of PM2.5, contributing more than 40%. Primary organic aerosol (POA) fractions were higher in north India, while secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) dominated south India. Transport and residential sectors were the chief contributors to CA across India. Biomass burning contributed up to ∼23% of PM2.5 in regions of IGP during post-monsoon, with CA fractions up to 50%. Associations between PM2.5 and its components with daily inpatient admissions from a tertiary care centre in Delhi showed that PM2.5 and OIN had lower associations with daily hospital admissions than CA. Every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in POA, black carbon (BC), and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) were associated with ∼1.09%, ∼3.07% and ∼4.93% increase in the risk of daily hospital admissions. This invigorates the need for more policies targeting CA rather than PM2.5 to mitigate associated health risks, in India.},

abstract = {School children may be exposed to secondhand smoke (SHS) either at home, in transit or in social gatherings permitting smoking in their presence. Questionnaires about SHS often underestimate prevalence and extent of exposure. A more accurate tool is the use of biomarkers such as cotinine (COT) and trans-3′-hydrocycotinine (3HC) as biomarkers of SHS exposure, alongside 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), a reduction product in the body of the tobacco-specific nitrosamine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), both potent carcinogens. We measured urinary COT, 3HC and total NNAL using sensitive and specific high-performance LC-MS/MS methods. The limit of quantification (LOQ) for each assay were 0.05 ng/mL, 0.1 ng/mL and 0.25 pg/mL respectively. The aim of this study was to evaluate the exposure to SHS of school children (9–11 years), from five public schools in the island of Malta, from questionnaire information about smoking at home and verify it by urinary biomarker data of COT, 3HC and NNAL. These biomarkers were measurable in 99.4%, 95.4% and 98.3% of the participating children respectively. From the children reporting smoking at home, 11% had a history of asthma and had COT, 3HC and NNAL geometric mean concentrations double compared to the non-asthmatic group. In has been confirmed that non-smokers exposed to SHS and THS have a higher NNAL/COT ratio than the group identified as smokers according to specific and defined COT threshold levels (despite the fact that a priori, the entire study group was composed of non-smokers). The implication of high measured levels of urinary NNAL in children should be of concern given its potency. A main effects multifactor ANOVA model was developed and the children's house and school locations and the smoking frequency were statistically significant to predict the levels of the three metabolites. For 3HC only, the status of the employment of the mother was also an important predictor.},

abstract = {Maternal exposure to atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during pregnancy is associated with adverse fetal development, including abnormal brain development. However, the underlying mechanisms and influencing factors remain uncertain. This study investigated the roles of DNA methylation in genes involving neurodevelopment and thyroid hormones (THs) in fetal brain development after maternal exposure to PM2.5 from e-waste. Among 939 healthy pregnant women recruited from June 2011 to September 2012, 101 e-waste-exposed and 103 reference mother-infant pairs (204 pairs totally) were included. Annual ground-level PM2.5 concentrations over e-waste-exposed area (116.38°E, 23.29°N) and reference area (116.67°E, 23.34°N) in 2011, 2012 were obtained by estimates and maternal exposure was evaluated by calculating individual chronic daily intakes (CDIs) of PM2.5. Methylation and THs including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) level were measured in umbilical cord blood collected shortly after delivery. We found higher ground-level PM2.5 concentrations led to greater individual CDI of PM2.5 in e-waste-exposed pregnant women. After adjustment for gender and birth BMI, significant mediation effects on the adverse associations of maternal PM2.5 exposure with birth head circumference were observed for methylations at positions +13 and + 32 (respectively mediated proportion of 9.8% and 5.3%, P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) in the brain-speciﬁc angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1) gene, but not for methylations in the catenin cadherin-associated protein, alpha 2 (CTNNA2) gene. BAI1 (position +13) methylation was also significantly correlated with FT3 levels (rs = −0.156, P = 0.032), although maternal CDI of PM2.5 was positively associated with higher odds of abnormal TSH levels (OR = 5.03, 95% CI: 1.00, 25.20, P = 0.05) rather than FT3 levels. Our findings suggest that methylation (likely linked to THs) in neonates may play mediation roles associated with abnormal brain development risk due to maternal exposure to atmospheric PM2.5 from e-waste.},

Prenatal arsenic (As) exposure could negatively affect child neuropsychological development, but the current evidence is inconclusive.
Objectives
To explore the relationship between prenatal urinary total As (TAs) concentrations, the As species and the methylation efficiency, and child neuropsychological development in a Spanish birth cohort. We also studied the effect modification produced by sex and several nutrients and elements.
Materials and methods
Study subjects were 807 mother–child pairs participating in the INMA (Childhood and Environment) Project. Urinary TAs and its metabolites, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), inorganic As (iAs) and arsenobetaine were measured in the first trimester of pregnancy. Methylation efficiency was determined through the percentages of the metabolites and using principal component analysis. Children's neuropsychological development was assessed at the age of 4–5 years using the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA). Multivariable linear regression models were built to assess the association between TAs, the As species and the maternal methylation efficiency, and the neuropsychological scores. We explored effect modification by sex, iron status, maternal nutrients status (serum manganese and selenium, and urinary zinc), and maternal vitamins intake (folate, and vitamins B12 and B6).
Results
The geometric mean (95%CI) of ∑As (sum of DMA, MMA and iAs) was 7.78 (7.41, 8.17) $\mu$g/g creatinine. MMA concentrations were inversely associated with the scores for the general, verbal, quantitative, memory, executive function and working memory scales (i.e. $\beta$ [CI95%] = −1.37 [-2.33, −0.41] for the general scale). An inverse association between %MMA and the memory scores was found. Children whose mothers had lower manganese, zinc and ferritin concentrations obtained lower scores on several MSCA scales with decreasing As methylation efficiency.
Discussion
An inverse association was observed between MMA concentrations and children's neuropsychological development. Maternal levels of manganese, zinc and ferritin affected the association between As methylation efficiency and MSCA scores.},

Predicted PAHs were in agreement with observations from literature. Surface 16-PAHs were highest in winter, with a peak value of 2.5 $\mu$g/m3 and population-weighted average of 0.5 $\mu$g/m3 in northern and eastern India, where biomass burning and coal combustion were chief contributors. Pre-monsoon and monsoon had lower concentrations ∼0.2 $\mu$g/m3. The incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) was greater than 4E-4 in many industrial and urban areas. Exposure to PAHs resulted in 7431 excess lifetime cancer cases. Coal combustion and biomass burning were major contributors to ILCR, followed by gas and oil activities. Much higher health risks were observed in urban than in rural areas. India showed much higher levels of total PAHs and cPAHs than the U.S but moderately less than China.},

The measured 24-h average PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations at different locations were found between 134.7 and 257.7 $\mu$g/m3 and 78.7–121.1 $\mu$g/m3, respectively. The 24-h average PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations at the study sites were exceeding the national (NAAQS) and WHO limits by more than 1.3 and 3 times, respectively. The PM mass was enriched with carbonaceous matter, ions, crustal and trace elements and their concentrations (except, Sr, Ni, S, As, V, Sb, Ga- the trace elements associated with coal and heavy oil combustion & NO3− - due to high nitrate formation ability at greater heights) were found higher in LE. The source apportionment study was performed with positive matrix factorisation (PMF). PMF analysis identified vehicular emission (PM10, 9.6–24.3% & PM2.5, 12.1–25.3%), secondary inorganics (PM10, 6.4–22.5% & PM2.5, 11–23%), crustal source (PM10, 9–52% & PM2.5, 3.8–10.7%), fuel oil combustion (PM10, 3–21% & PM2.5, 9–23%), biomass burning (PM10, 7.4–28.6% & PM2.5, 6–50.5%), and coal combustion (PM10, 13–17% & PM2.5, 14–19.1%) as the main sources of PM10 and PM2.5 at the study sites. A significant difference in source contribution between the elevations was observed for coal combustion, fuel oil combustion, biomass burning, and crustal sources. The contribution of vehicular emission and secondary inorganics estimates were broadly similar at both elevations. Coal and fuel oil combustion contribution was found relatively higher at HE. Further, health risk due to exposure to toxic heavy metals in PM2.5 was assessed. Non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks (averaged of four sites) for both children and adults were exceeding the acceptable limit by more than 1.13 times. Results also showed that the public residing at HE is more susceptible to have greater health risks than LE at Delhi city. Sources contribution to carcinogenic risk was assessed and the results indicated that coal combustion (41%) contribution was highest followed by crustal sources (22%), fuel oil combustion (17%), vehicular emission (12%), biomass burning (4%) and secondary inorganics (4%).},
