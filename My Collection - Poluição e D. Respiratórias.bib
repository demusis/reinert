abstract = {Three thousand four hundred fifty-one Austrian elementary school children were examined (between 2 and 8 times) by spirometry by standardized methods, over a 5yr period. The districts where they lived were grouped into those where NO2 declined during this period (by at least 30$\mu$g/m3 measured as half year means) and those with less or no decline in ambient NO2. In both groups of districts, SO2 and TSP fell by similar amounts over this period. A continuous improvement of MEF25 (maximum exspiratory flow rate at 25% vital capacity) was found in districts with declining ambient NO2. Populations did not differ in respect of anthropometric factors, passive smoking or socioeconomic status. A birth cohort from this study population which was followed up to age 18 confirmed the improved growth of MEF25 with decline in NO2, while the improved growth of forced vital capacity was more related to decline in SO2. This study provides the first evidence that improvements in the outdoor air quality during the 1980s are correlated with health benefits, and suggest that adverse effects on lung function related to ambient air pollution are reversible before adulthood. Improvement of small airway functions appeared to be more dependent on reductions of NO2 than reduction in SO2 and TSP. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Deposition of element-specific particulate matter in the respiratory system of a Caucasian-type healthy adult male and female was computed by a stochastic lung deposition model for different reference levels of physical exertion using mass size distributions in the aerodynamic diameter interval of 0.125-16 $\mu$m experimentally determined in urban environments. Particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than about 0.3 $\mu$m are deposited in the whole respiratory system decreasingly with rising physical exertion, while the opposite is observed for particles with an aerodynamic diameter larger than about 0.7 $\mu$m (except for the highest physical activity). It is the light exercise that causes the largest extrathoracic (ET) deposition efficiency of the particles in this last diameter range, and, consequently, the smallest tracheobronchial and acinar depositions. The results obtained indicate that ET deposition depends primarily on the size distribution of the inhaled particles, while physical exertion plays a minor role. In contrast, deposition fractions of different aerosol species in the lungs are very similar to each other for a given physical exertion, despite the rather diverse size distributions of some species, but depend significantly on the subject's physical exertion. The differential deposition curves generally exhibit two peaks, one in the tracheobronchial and one in the acinar region. Both differential and regional deposition fractions do not change in a monotonical fashion with physical exertion but display maximum values approximately at the exertion level corresponding to the switching point between the nose-breathing mode and the combined nose- and mouth-breathing mode. Deposition rates (mass doses), however, increase monotonically with physical exertion due to increased ventilation rates, and more particles reach the deeper parts of the lung. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Our study period was for the summer months, June-August, from July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1996. We preformed Poisson regression analyses for the number of daily emergency department (ED) visits for asthma in each city and on the aggregate data controlling for time trends and minimum temperature. We found a 12% increased likelihood of an asthma ED visit per 50$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10 in Cleveland [95% confidence interval (CI)=0-27%] and a 35% increase per 50$\mu$g/m3 increase in SO2 in Cincinnati (95% CI=9-21%). When data were analyzed for all three cities combined, the risk of an ED visit increased for all pollutant increases and specifically by 12% (95% CI=1-23%) per 50$\mu$g/m3 increase in SO2. Attributable risk estimates show a five times greater impact on Cleveland over Cincinnati or Columbus.

Between March and May 2001 the daily means of the signals of a diffusion charging sensor, measuring the "active surface" of suspended particles, and a photoelectric aerosol sensor, measuring the particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, were related to spirometric results of the total 164 children examined and to the daily symptom scores of a susceptible subgroup. Significant reductions of forced vital capacity (p=0.006) and forced expiratory volume in the first second (p=0.001) and significant increases of wheezing (p=0.001), shortness of breath (p=0.041), cough in the evening (p=0.031) and at night (p=0.018) were found with increase of "active surface" of suspended particles measured at the adjacent outdoor monitoring station, but not with the increase of particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

abstract = {Background: The association between social position, living environment and nasal symptoms is inconsistent. We wanted to test how living environment, occupation and social position were associated with nasal symptoms. Methods: In a postal survey study of a random sample of 12,079 adults, aged 20-59 years living in the southern part of Sweden the relationship between nasal symptoms, socio-economic status and environmental factors was analysed. Results: The response rate was 70% In = 8469) of whom 33% reported significant nasal symptoms. Nasal discharge, thick yellow discharge, a blocked nose, sneezing and itching were strongly associated with living close to heavy traffic or living in cities Most of the nasal symptoms provoked by extrinsic factors were more frequently reported among subjects who lived close to heavy traffic and in cities. Apart from thick yellow discharge and nasal symptoms provoked by damp/cold air which were more common in the socio-economic position "low" no relation to the socio-economic group was found. The prevalence of self-reported hay fever was neither affected by site of living nor by socio-economic status. Nasal symptoms evoked by "allergic" factors were linked to asthma but symptoms evoked by non-allergic factors were linked to chronic bronchitis/emphysema CBE. Conclusions: To conclude, we found a strong relation between geographical site and the prevalence of self-reported nasal symptoms which emphasizes the environment as a risk factor for nasal symptoms. Only by merging the socio-economic groups into "low" and "middle/high" an association to nasal symptoms was apparent. Nasal symptoms evoked by "allergic" factors were linked to asthma but symptoms evoked by "non allergic factors" were linked to CBE. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. Alt rights reserved.},

In this study, we investigated the association between the fractional concentration of expired nitric oxide (FENO) and exposure to metal constituents of particulate matter with an aerodynamic mass median diameter≤2.5$\mu$m (PM2.5) in boilermakers exposed to ROFA and metal fume. Metals investigated included vanadium, chromium, manganese, nickel, copper, and lead. Subjects were monitored for 5 consecutive days during boiler repair overhauls in 1999 (n=20) and 2000 (n=14). In 1999, we found a significant inverse association between log-transformed FENO and PM2.5 metal concentrations. LogFENO changed by -0.03 (95% CI: -0.04, -0.01), -0.56 (95% CI: -0.88, -0.24), -0.09 (95% CI: -0.16, -0.02), and -0.04 (95% CI: -0.07, -0.02) per $\mu$g/m3 of PM2.5 vanadium, chromium, manganese, and nickel, respectively. In 2000, no significant associations were observed, most likely due to exposure misclassification resulting from the use of respirators. The inverse association between PM2.5 metal exposure and F ENO in subjects with limited respirator usage suggests that soluble transition metals might be partially responsible for the adverse pulmonary responses seen in workers exposed to ROFA. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Design: An ecological time-series analysis was performed for a period of 2 years (July 1998-June 2000). Generalized additive model yields to relative risks and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimates were also carried out. Main results: The 10-day cumulative effect of a 10-$\mu$g/m3 black smoke increase was significantly associated with a 6.2% (95% CI, 2.4-10.1%) increase in the sales of anti-asthmatics and bronchodilators and to a 9.2% (95% CI, 5.9-12.6%) increase in the sales of cough and cold preparation for children aged under 15 years. The cumulative effect of a 10-$\mu$g/m3 increase in SO2 was associated with an 11.8% (95% CI, 6.7-17.1%) increase in cough and cold preparation sales for children aged under 15 years. The cumulative effect of 10-$\mu$g/m3 increase in NO2 was associated with an 13.6% (95% CI, 8-18.3%) increase in cough and cold preparation sales for children under 15 years of age.

abstract = {To examine hypotheses regarding health effects of particulate matter, we conducted time series studies in Austrian urban and rural areas. Of the pollutants measured, ambient PM2.5 was most consistently associated with parameters of respiratory health. Time series studies applying semiparametric generalized additive models showed significant increases of respiratory hospital admissions (ICD 490-496) at age 65 and older. The early increase of 5.5% in Vienna at a lag of 2 days in males and of 5.6% per 10$\mu$g/m3 at a lag of 3 days in females was not observed in a nearby rural area. Another increase of respiratory admissions (mainly COPD) was observed after a lag of 10-11 days. A time series on a panel of 56 healthy preschool children showed a significant impact of the carbonaceous fraction of PM2.5 on tidal breathing pattern assessed by inductive plethysmography. In repeated oscillometric measurements of respiratory resistance in 164 healthy elementary school children not only immediate responses to fine particulates were found but also latent ones, possibly indicating inflammatory changes in airways. It may be speculated that the improvements of urban air quality prevented measurable effects on respiratory mortality. More sensitive indicators, however, still show acute impairments of respiratory function and health in elderly and children which are associated with fine particulates and subfractions related to motor traffic. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Particulate matter (PM), a component of urban air pollution that derives primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, is responsible for a number of health effects in humans. Recent studies have demonstrated that the fine particles (PM2.5) present in high numbers in PM samples can be more harmful than larger particles, since they are more efficiently retained in the peripheral lung. In the present study, we have investigated the biological effects of PM2.5 on human lung epithelial cell line A549. Morphological analysis performed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy showed that fine particles interact with the cell surface, where they induce evident alterations and, subsequently, are internalized in the cytoplasm. Cytoskeletal components, in particular microfilaments and microtubules, cause modifications upon challenge with PM2.5. Of interest, an early cell response to the fine particulate is an increase of reactive oxygen species content, which can account for the observed cytoskeletal changes and the production of proinflammatory cytokines in A549 cells. In particular, exposure to PM2.5 promoted a dose- and time-dependent release of TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-6 in the cell medium. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this work, we have studied the effects of nasal instillation of increasing doses of different PS in mice: saline, carbon, and two types of particle surrogates. PS type A (PSA) was the ROFA collected from the waste incinerator of our university hospital; PS type B (PSB) was collected from the electrostatic precipitator of a large steel company and thus had an elevated metal content.

Nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide were significantly associated with hospitalization for COPD, and the magnitude of effects was increased slightly with increasing days of exposure averaging, with the relative risk for a 7-day average being 1.11 (95%CI: 1.04, 1.20) and 1.08 (1.02, 1.13) for nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, respectively. There was no significant association between either sulfur dioxide or ozone and COPD hospitalization. The combined relative risk for all four gaseous pollutants on COPD hospitalization was 1.21.

Data from 6896 subjects of the German Health Survey 1998 with complete information on residential street type were used. Multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to model associations between street type categories, and respiratory and atopic outcomes were assessed by screening questionnaire of The European Respiratory Health Survey and specific IgE measurements. Living at extremely or considerably busy roads (23.9% of total study population) compared to roads with no or rare traffic (64.5%) was statistically significantly associated with chronic bronchitis (aOR 1.36 (95% CI) (1.01-1.83)) while nocturnal coughing attacks (past 12 months) (1.24 (0.98-1.57)), wheeze during the past 12 months (1.21 (0.93-57)), and hay fever (1.16 (0.94-1.42)) were marginally increased after adjustment for several potential confounders and for multiple testing. No increased risks were found for asthma (0.97 (0.67-1.42)) and allergic sensitization (1.05 (0.91-1.20)). We conclude that exposure to traffic-related air pollutants increases the risk of nonallergic respiratory symptoms and to a lesser degree the risk of hay fever and allergic sensitization but not the risk of asthma in adults. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The majority of women living in rural areas in Turkey use biomass fuels for domestic energy and are exposed to high levels of indoor air pollution every day. The objective of this study was to compare the presence of chronic airway diseases (CAD) in two groups of nonsmoking women older than 40 years with (exposed group, n=397) and without a history of exposure to biomass cooking (liquid petroleum gas (LPG); control group, n=199), in 2002 in Kirikkale, Turkey. Detailed respiratory symptoms were collected with a standard questionnaire adapted from that of the British Medical Research Council. Exposure was calculated as the average hours spent daily for cooking multiplied by the number of years. CAD were defined as either chronic airway obstruction (CAO; (forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity)<0.70), chronic bronchitis, or chronic bronchitis with CAO. The prevalence of CAD in the exposed group was found to be higher than that in the LPG group (28.5% vs. 13.6%, crude odds ratios (ORs) 2.5 (1.5-4.0), P=0.0001). The fraction of CAD attributed to exposure to biomass smoke after adjusting for possible confounding factors was 23.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 13.4-33.2). Acute symptoms during exposure to biomass smoke were important predictors for the presence of CAD. Biomass smoke pollution is an important contributing factor in the development of CAD in nonsmoking women living in a rural area. The presence of acute symptoms during cooking in women in rural areas should signal to general practitioners the possibility of CAD. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been considered a disease of Caucasian men, recent data show mortality rising faster among women and African-Americans. Some have suggested these groups are more susceptible to tobacco smoke. We examined this issue in our own population of COPD patients. Methods: Beginning in March 2003 we prospectively developed a COPD research database to facilitate recruitment for clinical trials. Enrollees are recruited from clinics and paid advertising and their demographics, medical/smoking histories, and spirometric data are recorded. We examined the smoking histories and pulmonary function of enrollees over 45, with {greater than or slanted equal to}20 pack-years of smoking, FEV1/FVC (forced expiratory volume forced vital capacity) <0.70, and a race-adjusted post-bronchodilator FEV1<80%. The primary outcome was the loss of lung function per pack-year smoked, or Susceptibility Index (SI), calculated using the formula: (% predicted FEV1-100)/pack-years. Results: A total of 585 patients enrolled during the study period and 330 met our inclusion criteria. Caucasians were older than African-Americans (63 vs. 58, P = 0.0003) and had more pack-years of smoking (57 vs. 43, P = 0.0003). There were no differences in lung function or bronchodilator reversibility among the racial or gender subgroups. Caucasians had less loss of lung function per pack-year smoked than African-Americans ( SI = - 1.02 % vs. -1.34%, P = 0.007) and men less than women ( SI = - 0.98 % vs. -1.21%, P = 0.001). Caucasian males appeared relatively protected from tobacco smoke ( SI = - 0.93 %), while African-American women appeared most susceptible ( SI = - 1.42 %). Conclusions: There are important differences in racial and gender susceptibility to tobacco smoke among patients with COPD. African-American females appear to be at highest risk and may benefit most from smoking cessation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We investigated whether exposure of alveolar macrophages to aggregates of ultrafine carbon particles affected subsequent phagocytosis of microorganisms. Human alveolar macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage and exposed to aggregates of ultrafine carbon particles or diesel exhaust particles (DEP) for 20 h before measurements of phagocytosis. The particle loads were estimated to be comparable to those of air pollution exposure with established health effects in humans. Phagocytotic activity was measured as attachment and ingestion of four different test particles (amorphous silica particles, yeast cells from Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans opsonized with specific IgG or fresh serum) that bind to scavenger, mannose, Fc, and complement receptors, respectively. Carbon preloading significantly impaired the attachment and ingestion process (P<0.01) for all particles, except for yeast cells from C. neoformans opsonized with specific IgG. On the average, the accumulated attachment decreased by 30% and the ingested fraction decreased by 10%. Loading of alveolar macrophages with either aggregates of ultrafine DEP or carbon particles impaired the phagocytosis of silica test particles in a similar way. Exposure of human alveolar macrophages to aggregates of carbon or DEP, in concentrations relevant to human environmental exposures, caused significant impairment of phagocytosis of silica particles and microorganisms. The inhibitory effect on particle phagocytosis mediated by four different receptors suggests that air pollution particles cause a general inhibition of macrophage phagocytosis. Such an effect may contribute to increased susceptibility to infections and, for example, result in more exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Approximately half the world uses biomass fuel for domestic energy, resulting in widespread exposure to indoor air pollution (IAP) from biomass smoke. IAP has been associated with many respiratory diseases, though it is not clear what relationship exists between biomass use and pulmonary function. Four groups containing 20 households each were selected in Santa Ana, Ecuador based on the relative amount of liquid petroleum gas and biomass fuel that they used for cooking. Pulmonary function tests were conducted on each available member of the households {greater than or slanted equal to}7 years of age. The pulmonary functions of both children (7-15 years) and women ({greater than or slanted equal to}16 years) were then compared between cooking fuel categories using multivariate linear regression, controlling for the effects of age, gender, height, and exposure to tobacco smoke. Among the 80 households, 77 children and 91 women performed acceptable and reproducible spirometry. In multivariate analysis, children living in homes that use biomass fuel and children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke had lower forced vital capacity and lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( P < 0.05). However, no significant difference in pulmonary function was observed among women in different cooking categories. Results of this study demonstrate the harmful effects of IAP from biomass smoke on the lung function of children and emphasize the need for public health efforts to decrease exposure to biomass smoke. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Atmospheric particulate matter (PM), an ingredient of urban pollution matter, is a mixture of solid and liquid particles differing in origin, dimension and composition. There is big concern about inhaled PM in urban areas, especially due to its adverse effects on the respiratory system. Diesel exhaust particulate (DEP), which constitutes the major part of PM, is characterized by a carbonic mixture composed of approximately 18,000 different high-molecular-weight organic compounds. Diesel engines release 10 times the amount of NO2 aldehydes and breathable PM compared to unleaded gasoline engines and more than 100 times that produced by catalysed gasoline engines; these data gain great significance when taken into account the fact that diesel-powered vehicles are becoming more and more popular. DEP polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), once deposited on airways mucous surfaces easily pass through epithelial cells (ECs) membranes, bind themselves to cytosolic receptors and then affect cell growth and differentiation. Human lung epithelial cells and macrophages engulf DEP, this resulting in increased proinflammatory cytokines release (IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF). We investigated the biological effects of DEP-PM on the human lung EC line A549. Light microscopy analysis suggested the presence of cell wall alterations, and provided evidence of PM internalization and cytoplasmic vacuolization. Following PM stimulation, nuclei also were seen undergo clear gross morphological modifications. Immunocytochemistry was used to detect intracytoplasmic IL-6 and IL-8 expression. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

The current study used a population-based time-series analysis design to evaluate the effects of daily and weekly PM10 and PM2.5 on respiratory health outcomes among children <20 years of age residing in Anchorage enrolled in Medicaid. All generated estimating equations models were adjusted for season, year, weekends, temperature, wind speed, and precipitation. Relative to the days with PM10 mass concentration ≤13 $\mu$g/m3, a significant 9.3% increase (RR: 1.093, 95% CI: 1.004-1.191) in the rate of outpatient visits for asthma occurred during days with PM10 of 20-33 $\mu$g/m3. No further dose-response occurred for days with PM10 ≥34 $\mu$g/m3. A significant 18.1% increase (RR: 1.181, 95% CI: 1.010-1.381) in the rate of quick-relief medication prescriptions occurred during days with PM10 of 34-60 $\mu$g/m3, and a 28.8% increase (RR: 1.288, 95% CI: 1.026-1.619) occurred during days with PM10≥61 $\mu$g/m3. Similar results for outpatient asthma visits and quick-relief medication occurred in weekly models. There were no significant associations with PM2.5 in either daily or weekly models. These subtle but statistically significant associations suggest that non-industrial, geologic sources of PM10 may have measurable health effects at levels below current national standards. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Using geographical information systems (GIS) tools, the present study analyzed the association between children's lung function development and their long-term exposure to air pollution. The study covered the cohort of 1492 schoolchildren living in the vicinity of a major coal-fired power station in the Hadera sub-district of Israel. In 1996 and 1999, the children underwent subsequent pulmonary function tests (PFT) (forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume during the first second (FEV1)), and the children's parents completed a detailed questionnaire on their health status and household characteristics. A negative association was found between changes in the results of PFT and the estimated individual levels of air pollution. A sensitivity test revealed a FEV1 decline from -4.3% for the average pollution level to -10.2% for the high air pollution level. The results of a sensitivity test for FVC were found to be similar. Association with the reported health status was found to be insignificant. As we conclude, air pollution from a coal-fired power station, although not exceeding local pollution standards, had a negative effect on children's lung function development. As argued, previous studies carried out in the region failed to show the above association because they were based on zone approaches that assign average concentration levels of air pollutants to all individuals in each zone, leading to a misclassification bias of individual exposure. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Dust events are common air pollution events in parts of the world with arid, semi-arid, or desert areas. There is little research on the association between respiratory and cardiovascular health and dust events in places which are close to the deserts. The aim of this study is to evaluate the health effects of dust events in a location where traffic and industry are underdeveloped and dust events are most frequent in China. The setting allows the opportunity to reduce confounding by anthropogenically derived particulate matter and to confirm the health effects of dust events. The present study was done using daily counts of hospitalizations in Minqin (1994-2003) for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth revision) for males and females. Using a semi-parametric generalized additive model and controlling for long-term temporal trends, day of the week, meteorological factors, and seasonal influence, counts of hospitalization were analyzed for dust events in a Poisson regression. Relative risks (RRs) were used to estimate the risk of dust events for respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations. In the year-round model, dust events with a lag of 3 days were significantly associated with total respiratory hospitalization for males and females, with RRs of 1.14 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.29) and 1.18 (95% CI 1.00-1.41); dust events with a lag of 4 days were significantly associated with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in males (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04-1.59), and dust events with a lag of 6 days were significantly associated with pneumonia in males, with an RR of 1.17 (95% CI 1.00-1.38). A significant association between dust events with a lag of 3 days and hypertension in males was also found (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03,1.64). In the seasonal analysis model, the associations between the dust events and respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations were stronger in spring and in winter, respectively. The results show the health effects of dust events on respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations, and the characteristic seasonal distribution of the health effects. In addition, the health effects of dust events are consistent with recent animal and human data showing the respiratory and cardiovascular effects of particulate matter. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We hypothesized that aggregates of ultrafine carbon and washed diesel particles impair the ability of alveolar macrophages (AM) to kill bacteria and enhance the AM lipid peroxidation (LPO) of lung surfactant. Rat AM were exposed, 5 h, to particles 20 $\mu$g/ml. The AM, containing carbon or washed diesel particles, were incubated 2 h, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, an American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strain or clinical isolates. Surviving bacteria were quantified. Surfactant was incubated, 5 h, with carbon or washed diesel loaded AM and LPO was measured. The particle load was approximately 1 $\mu$g/106 AM, representing accepted exposure to ambient particles in Europe. Metal concentrations were 10 to 100 fold higher in washed diesel-than in carbon particles. There was a dose dependent increase in bacterial survival with carbon-loaded macrophages, but not with washed diesel-loaded AM. Clinical isolates had a higher survival rate with carbon-loaded macrophages than the ATCC strain. Surfactant LPO was increased with washed diesel-loaded macrophages (95%) and with carbon-loaded macrophages (55%) compared to controls. High LPO caused by washed diesel-loaded AM reflects their increased oxidative metabolism, probably caused by particle metals. The additional oxygen metabolites maintained bactericidal activity of AM, while corresponding activity was decreased in carbon-loaded AM. Altered functions of AM may explain health problems related to air pollution. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Current standards for fine particulates and nitrogen dioxide are under revision. Patients with cardiovascular disease have been identified as the largest group which need to be protected from effects of urban air pollution. Methods: We sought to estimate associations between indicators of urban air pollution and daily mortality using time series of daily TSP, PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, O3 and nontrauma deaths in Vienna (Austria) 2000-2004. We used polynomial distributed lag analysis adjusted for seasonality, daily temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and incidence of influenza as registered by sentinels. Results: All three particulate measures and NO2 were associated with mortality from all causes and from ischemic heart disease and COPD at all ages and in the elderly. The magnitude of the effect was largest for PM2.5 and NO2. Best predictor of mortality increase lagged 0-7 days was PM2.5 (for ischemic heart disease and COPD) and NO2 (for other heart disease and all causes). Total mortality increase, lagged 0-14 days, per 10 $\mu$g m-3 was 2.6% for PM2.5 and 2.9% for NO2, mainly due to cardiopulmonary and cerebrovascular causes. Conclusion: Acute and subacute lethal effects of urban air pollution are predicted by PM2.5 and NO2 increase even at relatively low levels of these pollutants. This is consistent with results on hospital admissions and the lack of a threshold. While harvesting (reduction of mortality after short increase due to premature deaths of most sensitive persons) seems to be of minor importance, deaths accumulate during 14 days after an increase of air pollutants. The limit values for PM2.5 and NO2 proposed for 2010 in the European Union are unable to prevent serious health effects. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Asthma is an important public health challenge. The objective of this research was to investigate the relationship of air pollution and weather to adolescent asthma prevalence and attack rate. A 6-month mass screening asthma study was conducted from October 1995 to March 1996 in Taiwan. The study population included junior high school students from throughout the country (1,139,452 students). Eighty-nine percent of students completed questionnaires (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood-ISAAC and New England Core Questionnaires) and passed a logical screening error program. Lung function data was collected to assist in the diagnosis of asthma status. From the students screened during this mass survey, a stratified random sample of 64,660 students was analyzed for asthma prevalence and attack rate. Using a regression model to compare the USEPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards 2000 (NAAQS, 2000) to asthma prevalence, this investigation found that the standards may not provide enough protection for adolescents after controlling for age, rhinitis, eczema, urban birth location, parental education level, exercise, cigarette smoking, environmental tobacco smoking, alcohol beverage consumption and weather factors. The general estimating equations (GEE) model, a repeated measurement regression model, was used to examine the relationship between the monthly asthma attack rate among asthma patients and air pollution (nitrogen oxides; nitrogen dioxide; nitric oxide; Ozone; PM10) while controlling for household smoking. The GEE model demonstrated that air pollution is related to asthma attack rate. Air pollution factors also interacted with weather parameters when related to asthma attack rate. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This study was designed to assess the impact of the ionic composition of particulate matter on asthmatic respiratory functions in S{\~{a}}o Paulo city. From May to July 2002, fine and coarse particulate matter fractions were collected and their respective chemical composition with respect to major ions (Na+, Mg2+, K+, Ca2+, NH4+, Cl-, NO3- and SO42-) were determined in each aqueous-extract fraction. The results showed predominant concentrations of SO42- (48.4%), NO3- (19.6%) and NH4+ (12.5%) in the fine fraction, whereas NO3- (35.3%), SO42- (29.1%), Ca2+ (13.1%) and Cl- (12.5%) were the predominant species in the coarse fraction. The association between the chemical components of both fractions and the daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements (morning and evening) of the 33 asthmatic individuals were assessed through a linear mixed-effects model. The results showed a significant negative correlation (decrease of PEF) between morning PEF and coarse chloride (3-day moving average) and between evening PEF and coarse Na+ (3-day moving average), coarse Mg2+ (3-day moving average) and coarse NH4+ (2- and 3-day moving average). A significant negative correlation has also been observed between morning and evening PEF and Mg2+ in the fine fraction. These results suggest that some particle chemical constituents may increase the responsiveness of airways and that coarse particles that deposit in the upper airways may be more relevant for asthmatic response and irritation.

Objective
The possible effect of the various meteorological variables on the incidence of upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs) has intrigued the scientific community for decades.
Methods
We performed a retrospective analysis regarding the association between meteorological variables and clinical data for upper and lower RTIs in the area of Attica, Greece.
Results
There was a statistically significant (P<0.001) negative correlation between weekly average temperature with the proportion of weekly house call visits resulting in a diagnosis of upper or lower RTIs 4 days later (R=−0.56 and −0.71 for upper and lower RTIs, respectively) as well as 7 days later (R=−0.57 and −0.71 for upper and lower RTIs, respectively) and during the same day (R=−0.55 and −0.68 for upper and lower RTIs, respectively). In addition, there was a negative correlation between weekly wind chill average (and minimum) temperature as well as a positive correlation of relative humidity with upper and lower RTIs. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between wind speed and upper or lower RTIs.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that house call visits due to upper and lower RTIs increased as the average temperature in the area of Attica decreased.},

Asian dust storms reaching Taipei, Taiwan are tracked by satellite images and confirmed by backward trajectory analysis and ground air pollution monitoring between 1995 and 2002. Our outcome variables include emergency visits for ischaemic heart diseases (ICD-9-CM 410-411, 414), cerebrovascular diseases (ICD-9-CM 430-437), and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (ICD-9-CM 493, 496) from the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). We use simple paired t-test and Poisson regression models to compare difference in emergency visits, air pollution levels and meteorological conditions for the pairs of Asian dust events and pre-dust periods. There were 39 high dust events with PM10 greater than 90$\mu$g/m3 and another 46 low dust events with PM10 less than 90$\mu$g/m3. Compared to their pre-dust periods, PM10 concentrations are significantly increased by 77$\mu$g/m3 per event for the high dust events. Asian dust storms increase cardiopulmonary emergency visits during storm-affecting periods in Taipei when ambient PM10 concentrations are above 90$\mu$g/m3. Compared to their pre-dust periods, emergency visits for ischaemic heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and COPD during high dust events are increased by 0.7 case (35%), 0.7 case (20%), and 0.9 case (20%) per event, respectively, by paired t-tests. By comparing the model-predicted to the observed emergency visits, we find emergency visits for cardiovascular diseases (ICD-9-CM 410-411, 414, 430-437) were significantly increased by 2.9 cases (67%) per event for the 39 high Asian dust events.},

abstract = {Air pollution caused by the lime production industry has become a serious problem with potential effects to human health, especially in developing countries. Colombo is a city included in the Metropolitan Region of Curitiba (capital of Paran{\'{a}} State) in South Brazil. In Colombo city, a correlation has been shown between the lime production and the number of persons who need respiratory treatment in a local hospital, indicating that the lime industry can cause deleterious health effects in the exposed workers and population. This research was conducted to deal firstly with the characterization of the size distribution and chemical compositions of particles emitted from lime manufacturing and subsequently to assess the deposition rate of inhaled dolomitic lime aerosol particles in the human respiratory tract. The elemental chemical composition and particle size of individual atmospheric particles was quantitatively elucidated, including low-Z components like C, N and O, as well as higher-Z elements, using automated electron probe microanalysis. Information concerning the bulk composition is provided by energy-dispersive X-ray detection. The majority of the respirable particulate matter identified was composed of aluminosilicates, Ca–Mg oxides, carbon-rich particles, mixtures of organic particles and Ca–Mg carbonates, soot and biogenic particles. In view of the chemical composition and size distribution of the aerosol particles, local deposition efficiencies in the human respiratory system were calculated, revealing the deposition of CaO{\textperiodcentered}MgO at extrathoracic, tracheobronchial and pulmonary levels. The results of this study offer evidence to the threat of the fine and coarse particles emitted from dolomite lime manufacturing, allowing policy-makers to better focus their mitigation strategies in an effective way, as well as to the dolomite producers for the purpose of designing and/or implementing improved emission controls.},

abstract = {The impact of particle emissions by biomass burning is increasing throughout the world. We explored the toxicity of particulate matter produced by sugar cane burning and compared these effects with equivalent mass of traffic-derived particles. For this purpose, BALB/c mice received a single intranasal instillation of either distilled water (C) or total suspended particles (15$\mu$g) from an urban area (SP group) or biomass burning-derived particles (Bio group). Lung mechanical parameters (total, resistive and viscoelastic pressures, static elastance, and elastic component of viscoelasticity) and histology were analyzed 24h after instillation. Trace elements and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) metabolites of the two sources of particles were determined. All mechanical parameters increased similarly in both pollution groups compared with control, except airway resistive pressure, which increased only in Bio. Both exposed groups showed significantly higher fraction area of alveolar collapse, and influx of polymorphonuclear cells in lung parenchyma than C. The composition analysis of total suspended particles showed higher concentrations of PAHs and lower concentration of metals in traffic than in biomass burning-derived particles. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a single low dose of ambient particles, produced by traffic and sugar cane burning, induced significant alterations in pulmonary mechanics and lung histology in mice. Parenchymal changes were similar after exposure to both particle sources, whereas airway mechanics was more affected by biomass-derived particles. Our results indicate that biomass particles were at least as toxic as those produced by traffic.},

Bioavailability of soluble PM compounds like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and transition metals has been shown to play a key role in lung injury. We have previously characterized the size, shape, and chemical components of urban air particles from Buenos Aires (UAP-BA) and their biological impact on lungs. Herein, we evaluate the possible toxic effect of UAP-BA-soluble fraction (UAP-BAsf) on pulmonary cells obtained from young (1–2 months old) and aged (9–12 months old) Wistar rats using phagocytosis, oxidant–antioxidant generation, and apoptosis as endpoints. UAP-BA were collected in downtown BA and residual oil fly ash (ROFA), employed as a positive control, was collected from Boston Edison Co., Mystic Power Plant, Mystic, CT, USA. Both particle-soluble fractions (sf) were employed at concentrations ranging from 0 to 100$\mu$g/mL. UAP-BAsf and ROFAsf even at the lowest dose assayed (10$\mu$g/mL) showed in both lung cell populations the ability to stimulate phagocytosis and increase superoxide anion (O2−) generation. Both types of air particles caused a marked intracellular oxidant stress in aged pulmonary cells that may contribute to subsequent cell activation and production of proinflammatory mediators, leading to cell dysfunction. These data suggest that the impact of UAP-BAsf on phagocytosis, oxidant radical generation, and apoptosis is clearly dependent on the maturational state of the animal and might have different mechanisms of action.},

Objectives
There is evidence suggesting that secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is causally linked to adverse respiratory effects. We examined the relations between the exposure to SHS and radiological signs in chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).
Methods
Asbestos-exposed workers (n=633) were imaged with HRCT, primarily to investigate potential occupational lung disease. After excluding current smokers, the study population included 361 ex- and 141 never-smokers. They answered a questionnaire on occupational exposures, smoking habits and SHS exposure. HRCT images were assessed for emphysema, ground-glass, irregular/linear and rounded opacities, honeycombing and several other signs. Regression analyses were adjusted for asbestos exposure, ex-smoking, age, body mass index and potential reader effect.
Results
Due to missing data the multivariate analyses were restricted to 310 participants aged 47.5–87.0 years. Their lifetime SHS exposure ranged between 0 and 193.5 pack-years (mean 23.5), and exposure in the past 12 months 0–30 packs (0.43). Total (B=0.005, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 0.002–0.008, p=0.000) and workplace (B=0.006, 95% CI 0.003–0.009, p=0.001) cumulative SHS exposures were significantly related to ground-glass opacities. Total SHS exposure in the last 12 months (B=0.027, 95% CI 0.000–0.054, p=0.048) and workplace exposure (B=0.027, 95% CI 0.000–0.054, p=0.048) were also significantly related to ground-glass opacities. Positive effects of SHS were also detected on irregular/linear opacities.
Conclusions
SHS exposure in the last 12 months and over lifetime significantly increases ground-glass opacity in HRCT, suggesting an early or subclinical desquamative interstitial pneumonia/respiratory bronchiolitis. This study further supports that SHS has adverse effects on the lungs that can be detected by X-ray methods.},

Two series of data from 34 hospitals, the daily number of emergency hospital consultations (n=50857) and the daily number of hospitalizations (n=16588) for bronchiolitis, were analyzed using alternative statistical methods; these were the generalized additive model (GAM) and case-crossover models. After adjustments for public holidays, holidays and meteorological variables the case-crossover model showed that PM10, BS, SO2 and NO2 were positively associated with both consultations and hospitalizations. GAM models, adjusting for long-term trend, seasonality, holiday, public holiday, weekday and meteorological variables, gave similar results for SO2 and PM10. This study shows that air pollution may act as a trigger for the occurrence of acute severe bronchiolitis cases.},

abstract = {Context and objective
Asthma among children is a major public health problem worldwide. There are increasing number of studies suggesting a possible association between allergenic pollen and exacerbations of asthma. In the context of global climate change, a number of future climate and air pollution scenarios predict increases in concentrations of pollen, an extension of the pollen season, and an increase in the allergenicity of pollen. The goal of the present study is to evaluate the short-term effects of exposure to grass and weed pollen on emergency department visits and readmissions for asthma among children aged 0–9 years living in Montreal between April and October, 1994–2004.
Methodology and results
Time-series analyses were carried out using parametric log-linear overdispersed Poisson models that were adjusted for temporal variations, daily weather conditions (temperature, atmospheric pressure), and gaseous air pollutants (ozone and nitrogen dioxide). We have found positive associations between emergency department visits and concentrations of grass pollen 3 days after exposure. The effect of grass pollen was higher on emergency department readmissions as compared to initial visits. Weak negative associations were found between weed pollen (including ragweed pollen) and emergency department visits 2 days after exposure.
Conclusion
The data indicate that among children, emergency department visits increased with increasing concentrations of grass pollen.},

Respiratory diseases constitute one of the leading causes of ill health among children in New York State (NYS). The current project, a component of the NYS Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, investigated a potential association between ambient ozone (O3) concentration and childhood respiratory hospital admissions over 11 years in NYS.
Methods
We used a two-stage Bayesian hierarchical model to assess the exposure–disease associations within 11 geographic regions and statewide. The data included total daily hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases for children 0–17 years old from 1991 to 2001 in NYS (N=134,099) and daily ambient O3 level with different single-day lags. These analyses adjusted for particulate matter ⩽10$\mu$m in size (PM10), meteorological conditions, day of the week, seasonality, long-term trends, and demographic characteristics.
Results
In 5 of the 11 regions, including the Upper and Lower Adirondacks, Upper Hudson Valley, Staten Island, and New York City, positive associations were found between respiratory hospital admissions and ambient O3 level 2 days prior to the admission. Applying different statistical methods and sensitivity analysis of PM10 did not alter these findings. When region-specific results were combined, no statewide association was apparent.
Conclusions
Geographic differences were found in the associations between O3 levels and respiratory hospital admissions among children. In addition, we found that the two-stage model may be an appropriate approach for tracking the health effects of air pollution over time in different geographic areas when heterogeneity of risk factors across regions is present.},

We investigated the influence of PM2.5 and other metrics of traffic-derived air pollution exposure using a matched case–control dataset derived from 1997 to 2003 birth and infant hospitalization records from the Puget Sound Region, Washington State. Mean daily PM2.5 exposure for 7, 30, 60 and lifetime days before case bronchiolitis hospitalization date were derived from community monitors. A regional land use regression model of NO2 was applied to characterize subject's exposure in the month prior to case hospitalization and lifetime average before hospitalization. Subject's residential proximity within 150m of highways, major roadways, and truck routes was also assigned. We evaluated 2604 (83%) cases and 23,354 (85%) controls with information allowing adjustment for mother's education, mother's smoking during pregnancy, and infant race/ethnicity. Effect estimates derived from conditional logistic regression revealed very modest increased risk and were not statistically significant for any of the exposure metrics in fully adjusted models. Overall, risk estimates were stronger when restricted to bronchiolitis cases attributed to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) versus unspecified and for longer exposure windows. The adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) and 95% confidence interval per 10mcg/m3 increase in lifetime PM2.5 was 1.14, 0.88–1.46 for RSV bronchiolitis hospitalization. This risk was also elevated for infants who resided within 150m of a highway (ORadj 1.17, 0.95–1.44). This study supports a developing hypothesis that there may be a modest increased risk of bronchiolitis attributable to chronic traffic-derived particulate matter exposure particularly for infants born just before or during peak RSV season. Future studies are needed that can investigate threshold effects and capture larger variability in spatial contrasts among populations of infants.},

abstract = {Background
Previous research demonstrates that ambient air pollution exacerbates asthma. Asthma morbidity also varies with socioeconomic position (SEP). Few studies have examined if ambient air pollution has a differential impact on income subgroups of the population. This paper investigates socioeconomic variation in ambulatory physician consultations for asthma and assesses possible effect modification of SEP on the association between physician visits and air pollution for children aged 1–17 and adults aged 18–64 in Toronto, Canada, between 1992 and 2001.
Methods
Generalized additive models and generalized linear models were used to estimate the adjusted risk of asthma physician visits associated with an interquartile range increase in sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5), and ozone (O3).
Results
A socioeconomic gradient in the number of physician visits was observed among children and adults and both sexes. SO2, NO2, and PM2.5 had positive associations with physician visits. The risk ratios for the low socioeconomic group were significantly greater than those for the high socioeconomic group in several of the models of SO2 and PM2.5.
Conclusions
These findings suggest increased ambulatory physician visits represent another component of the public health impact of urban air pollution. The burden of this impact may be borne disproportionately by those with lower SEP. Clarifying the role of SEP in altering susceptibility to the effects of air pollution is essential not only to inform revisions of ambient air quality standards, but also to design public health interventions to reduce health impacts on sensitive subgroups of the population.},

@article{Liang2009,
abstract = {Background
Many studies have investigated the effects of air pollutants on disease and mortality. However, the results remain inconsistent and inconclusive. We thought that the impact of different seasons or ages of people may explain these differences.
Methods
Measurement of the five pollutants (particulate matter <10$\mu$m in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), SO2, NO2, O3, and CO) was monitored by automated measuring units at five different stations. Monitoring stations were provided by the Taiwan Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from 1997 to 1999. The subjects in the study were classified in two groups: those 65 years of age and older, and those of all ages (including the subjects in the ⩾65 group). Data on daily mortality caused by respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and all other causes including the two aforementioned was collected by the Taiwan Department of Health (DOH). A time-series regression model was used to analyze the relative risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases due to air pollution in the summer and winter seasons.
Results
Risk of death from all causes and mortality from cardiovascular diseases during winter was significantly positively correlated with levels of SO2, CO, and NO2 for both groups of subjects and additionally with PM10 for the elderly (⩾65 years old) group. There were significant positive correlations with respiratory diseases and levels of O3 for both groups. However, the only significant positive correlation was with O3 (RR=1.283) for the elderly group during summer. No other parameters showed significance for either group.
Conclusion
Our findings contribute to the evidence of an association between SO2, CO, NO2, and PM10 and mortality from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, especially among elderly people during the winter season.},

Objective
To evaluate the adverse effect of exposure to air pollution on lung function growth in school-aged children.
Methods
A cohort of 1983 children from three districts in Guangzhou, China was followed-up for 6 months. The children performed pulmonary function tests twice, and their parents reported the child's respiratory symptoms by self-administered questionnaires in both surveys.
Results
The annual mean concentrations of air pollutants for the past 5 years for particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10), nitrogen (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were respectively: 96.1 $\mu$g/m3, 76.0 $\mu$g/m3, and 65.7 $\mu$g/m3 in the highly-polluted district (HPD), 80.3 $\mu$g/m3, 67.6 $\mu$g/m3, and 54.5 $\mu$g/m3 in the moderately-polluted district (MPD), and 80.0 $\mu$g/m3, 48.1 $\mu$g/m3, and 52.2 $\mu$g/m3 in the least-polluted district (LPD). After adjustment for potential confounders, significant deficits were found in the annual growth rates of forced expiratory flows at 25% (FEF25), and between 25% and 75% (FEF25–75) in boys and FEF25 in girls (In boys, for FEF25, −0.136 l/s, p = 0.008 in MPD and −0.153 l/s, p = 0.004 in HPD, respectively; for FEF25–75, −0.176 l/s, p = 0.013 in MPD and −0.167 l/s, p = 0.021 in HPD, respectively. In girls, for FEF25, −0.123 l/s, p = 0.043 in HPD), using LPD as the reference. Deficits in the annual growth rate of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were also negatively associated with air pollution in boys (−0.063 L, p = 0.032 in HPD).
Conclusions
The study adds more evidence that exposure to air pollution has adverse effects on lung function growth in schoolchildren.},

abstract = {By multilayer spiral low-dose computed tomography (LD-CT) of the chest this study assesses the early detection of lung lesions on a sample of 100 traffic policemen of a big Italian city professionally exposed to urban pollutants and 100 controls non-occupationally exposed to urban pollutants matched by sex, age, length of service and cigarette smoking habit. Exposure to urban pollutants in traffic policemen was characterized using the annual average concentrations of PM10, NO2 and benzene in the period 1998–2008 measured by fixed monitoring stations located in different areas of the city. A significant and increasing number of suspicious lung nodules with diameters between 5 and 10mm was observed: in traffic policemen (including smokers and non-smokers) vs. controls (including smokers and non-smokers); in total smokers (including traffic policemen and controls) vs. total non-smokers (traffic policemen and controls); in smoker traffic policemen vs. smoker controls and vs. non-smoker traffic policemen; in non-smoker traffic policemen vs. non-smoker controls. The RR of finding cases with at least one lung nodule with diameters between 5 and 10mm in traffic policemen (including smokers and non-smokers) compared to controls (including smokers and non-smokers) is 1.94 (CI 1.13–3.31); in total smokers vs. non-smokers the RR is 1.96 (CI 1.20–3.19). The comparison between the interaction exposure and smoking shows an increase in smoker traffic policemen than in smoker controls (RR=2.14; CI 1.02–4.52). The RR for smoker traffic policemen was higher than in non-smoker traffic policemen (RR=2.09; CI 1.19–3.66). The results of our study show that: (1) while smoker workers have a higher risk for developing solid suspicious lung nodules, the simple routinely exposure to urban pollutants is unable to produce the same kind of increased risk; (2) the interaction of smoking and exposure to urban pollutants greatly increases the risk for the development of solid suspicious lung nodules. In conclusion, the use of chest LD-CT in workers at risk helps identify suspicious solid lung nodules at early stage.},

Background
Our aim was to explore the association between respiratory health and proximity air quality in elderly.
Methods
The prevalence of respiratory conditions was linked in 2104 individuals aged ≥65 years recruited in Bordeaux (3C Study) to home address concentrations of NO2, CO, SO2, fine particles (PM10), VOCs and benzene, estimated through a dispersion model combining data on background air pollution, traffic characteristics, and conditions of topographical and meteorological dispersion of air pollutants.
Results
Mean [minimum; maximum] values of the annual concentrations ($\mu$g/m3) of proximity air pollutants were respectively: 28 [18; 72.2] for NO2, 420 [350; 1337] for CO, 7.5[5; 13.7] for SO2, 23.1 [19; 51] for PM10, 8.1 [0.01; 116.6] for VOCs and 1.8 [1.5; 6.9] for benzene. Using a binary logistic regression model, PM10 were significantly associated with usual cough (Odds-Ratio=1.33 (95% confidence interval: 1.00–1.77) for exposed compared to non-exposed) and SO2 with usual cough (1.55 (1.16–2.08)) and phlegm (1.45 (1.04–2.01)). We found a 10% and a 23% increase in usual cough for a 10$\mu$g/m3 increment in PM10 and a 1$\mu$g/m3 increment in SO2 respectively, and a 23% increase in usual phlegm for a 1$\mu$g/m3 increase in SO2. A sensitivity analysis showed similar results when considering 3-year proximity pollution. A more pronounced effect of SO2 and PM10 on usual cough and phlegm was observed in woman.
Conclusions
Our assessment of exposure to proximity air pollution has shown an increased prevalence of bronchitis-like symptoms in elderly living in areas polluted by SO2 and PM10.},

abstract = {Mail carriers represent an occupational group suffering from respiratory symptoms and lung function impairment. Although environmental conditions may play role, information on the effects of air pollution exposure in this population is lacking. The present study was conducted in Athens, Greece, in order to investigate the adverse effects of long-term air pollution exposure on respiratory outcomes in mail carriers. A total of 226 mail carriers and 73 office employees were enroled. Information on respiratory symptoms, medical, occupational, residential and smoking history was obtained through a questionnaire. Flow-volume curves were performed in the workplace using a portable spirometer. Individualised personal exposure assessment has been applied based on long-term residential and occupational subject history linked with geographical air pollution distribution. Furthermore, personal measurements were obtained for forty-one mail carriers using NO2 and O3 passive samplers, assuming that current air pollution exposure is sufficiently representative of long-term, previous exposure to make a plausible link with current health status. The analysis based on exposures estimated on the basis of residential and work addresses showed that the most exposed to PM10 postal workers have rhinitis at a higher rate (OR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.01–2.75). In mail carriers there is indication that those exposed to higher concentrations of Ο3 or PM10 have a greater possibility to present rhinitis (OR=1.63, 95% CI: 0.93–2.88 and OR=1.70, 95% CI: 0.96–3.03, respectively). The effect of O3 on rhinitis became even more apparent in the analysis based on exposures assessed by personal measurements (OR=6.74, 95% CI: 1.24–36.55). Exposure to NO2 was significantly associated with decrements in lung function. For office employees the exposure to air pollutants was not associated to any adverse respiratory outcome. Our findings suggest that air pollution is a contributing factor for the occurrence of rhinitis and lung function impairment in mail carriers.},

Objective
The associations between air pollution and children's respiratory health in the high pollution range have not yet been clearly characterized. We evaluated the effects of outdoor air pollution on respiratory morbidity in children selected from multiple sites in a heavy industrial province of northeastern China.
Methods
The study included 11,860 children aged 3–12 years, selected from 18 districts of 6 cities in Liaoning province, the participation rate is 89.9%. Informed consent and written responses to surveys about children's historic and current health status, personal and household characteristics, and other information were obtained from parents. A two-stage regression approach was applied in data analyses.
Results
There were wide gradients for TSP (188–689 $\mu$g/m3), SO2 (14–140 $\mu$g/m3 and NO2 (29–94 $\mu$g/m3) across the 18 districts of 6 cities. The three air pollutants significantly increased the prevalence of persistent cough (21–28%), persistent phlegm (21–30%) and current asthma (39–56%) for each interquartile range increment (172 $\mu$g/m3 for TSP, 69 $\mu$g/m3 for SO2, 30 $\mu$g/m3 for NO2), showing larger between-city effects than within-city. Rates of respiratory symptoms were significantly higher for children with younger age, atopy, respiratory disease in early age, family history of asthma or chronic bronchitis, and tobacco smoke exposure.
Conclusion
The high levels of outdoor air pollution in north China are positively associated with children's respiratory symptoms, the associations with TSP appear to be stronger than SO2 and NO2.},

Background
Previously, we reported that prenatal exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and postnatal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in combination were associated with respiratory symptoms at ages 1 and 2 years. Here, we hypothesized that children exposed to both prenatal PAH and ETS may be at greater risk of asthma and seroatopy at ages 5–6 years, after controlling for current pollution exposure.
Methods
Prenatal PAH exposure was measured by personal air monitoring over 48 h. ETS exposure, respiratory symptoms and asthma at ages 5–6 years were assessed through questionnaire. Immunoglobulin (Ig) E was measured by Immunocap.
Results
A significant interaction between prenatal PAH and prenatal (but not postnatal) ETS exposure on asthma (p < 0.05), but not IgE, was detected. Among children exposed to prenatal ETS, a positive nonsignificant association was found between prenatal PAH exposure and asthma (OR 1.96, 95% CI [0.95–4.05]). Among children without exposure to prenatal ETS, a negative nonsignificant association was found between prenatal PAH exposure and asthma (OR 0.65, 95% CI [0.41–1.01]). Prenatal PAH exposure was not associated with asthma or IgE at age 5–6 years.
Conclusions
Combined prenatal exposure to PAH and ETS appears to be associated with asthma but not seroatopy at age 5–6. Exposure to PAH alone does not appear associated with either asthma or seroatopy at age 5–6 years. Discerning the differential effects between ETS exposed and ETS nonexposed children requires further study.},

abstract = {Background
Asthma morbidity has been associated with ambient air pollutants in time-series and case-crossover studies. In such study designs, threshold effects of air pollutants on asthma outcomes have been relatively unexplored, which are of potential interest for exploring concentration–response relationships.
Methods
This study analyzes daily data on the asthma morbidity experienced by the pediatric Medicaid population (ages 2–18 years) of Detroit, Michigan and concentrations of pollutants fine particles (PM2.5), CO, NO2 and SO2 for the 2004–2006 period, using both time-series and case-crossover designs. We use a simple, testable and readily implementable profile likelihood-based approach to estimate threshold parameters in both designs.
Results
Evidence of significant increases in daily acute asthma events was found for SO2 and PM2.5, and a significant threshold effect was estimated for PM2.5 at 13 and 11$\mu$gm−3 using generalized additive models and conditional logistic regression models, respectively. Stronger effect sizes above the threshold were typically noted compared to standard linear relationship, e.g., in the time series analysis, an interquartile range increase (9.2$\mu$gm−3) in PM2.5 (5-day-moving average) had a risk ratio of 1.030 (95% CI: 1.001, 1.061) in the generalized additive models, and 1.066 (95% CI: 1.031, 1.102) in the threshold generalized additive models. The corresponding estimates for the case-crossover design were 1.039 (95% CI: 1.013, 1.066) in the conditional logistic regression, and 1.054 (95% CI: 1.023, 1.086) in the threshold conditional logistic regression.
Conclusion
This study indicates that the associations of SO2 and PM2.5 concentrations with asthma emergency department visits and hospitalizations, as well as the estimated PM2.5 threshold were fairly consistent across time-series and case-crossover analyses, and suggests that effect estimates based on linear models (without thresholds) may underestimate the true risk.},

abstract = {Human exposure to air pollution transported from the Midwest is evaluated in eight New York State (NYS) regions over ten summers (1997 – 2006) for association with respiratory–related hospital admissions. Days when pollution is transported into the Northeastern United States (U.S.) were identified by using back–trajectories from the eight regions. These back–trajectories help identify predominant meteorological patterns associated with “polluted” air parcels (originating in the Midwest where power plant emissions are known to be relatively high) and “clean” air parcels (originating from the North where pollution is known to be relatively low). Ambient ozone concentrations measurements were used to validate the classification of “polluted” and “clean” air parcels. These classifications were then used to define the days of high– versus low–exposure for populations residing within each region. The results of this analysis indicate that the risk of being hospitalized for respiratory–related illness in NYS is greater on those days when air is transported from the Midwest as compared to days when air is transported from the North. Using a refined method to examine air parcels moving through a boundary drawn around high–emitting power plants in the Midwestern U.S. resulted in stronger associations across more regions (significant odds ratios ranging from 1.06 to 1.16 for the entire study time period for six of the eight NYS regions). An assessment of temperature and its impact on the odds ratio calculation in the New York City metropolitan region indicates that temperature alone does not explain the increased association between air pollution and respiratory–related hospital admissions.},

abstract = {Background
Various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been related to respiratory health effects, but have generally been assessed individually without taking into account the fact that such pollutants are highly correlated to one other.
Aims
We investigated the effects of exposure to various VOC, and considered their combined effect on adult asthma and rhinitis.
Method
A national cross-sectional representative survey conducted by the Indoor Air Quality Observatory objectively assessed 20 VOCs in 490 main dwellings in France. A standardized questionnaire determined the prevalence of asthma and rhinitis among 1012 inhabitants of the dwellings (≥15 years). Marginal models for binary outcome were used to relate VOCs exposure to asthma and rhinitis, controlling for potential confounders. A global score representing the number of VOCs in each dwelling with an elevated concentration (using the 3rd quartile value of the distribution as a threshold value) was then derived as a measure of the combined effect of VOCs. Specific scores were built using a similar approach, grouping VOCs by family.
Results
Asthma (8.6%) was significantly associated with N-undecane and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and rhinitis (38.3%) with ethylbenzene, trichloroethylene, m/p- and o-xylene. The global VOC score was associated with a significant risk of asthma and rhinitis (odds ratio (OR) of 1.40 and 1.22, respectively, for 5 additional VOCs with high exposure level). Both specific scores for aromatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbons were associated with a significantly risk of asthma (OR=1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01–1.24 and OR=1.41; 95% CI=1.03–1.93, respectively). The specific VOC score for halogenated hydrocarbons was associated with a significant risk of rhinitis (OR=1.28; 95% CI: 1.07–1.54).
Conclusion
We have shown that high concentrations of VOCs in homes were associated with an increasing prevalence of asthma and rhinitis in adults.},

We explored effect modification patterns by season, sex, age and by the presence of desert dust transported mainly from the Sahara area. We used daily time-series data provided by the children's hospitals and the fixed monitoring stations. The associations were investigated using Poisson regression models controlling for seasonality, weather, influenza episodes, day of the week and holiday effects.

O3 was associated with a statistically significant increase in asthma admissions among older children in the summer. Our findings provide limited evidence of an association between NO2 exposure and asthma exacerbation. Statistically significant PM10 effects were higher during winter and during desert dust days, while SO2 effects occurred mainly during spring. Our study confirms previously reported PM10 effects on emergency hospital admissions for pediatric asthma and further provides evidence of stronger effects during desert dust days.

abstract = {Introduction
Many reports regarding the effects of air pollution on children's respiratory health have appeared in the scientific literature. Some investigators found increases in persistent cough and phlegm, bronchitis, and early respiratory infections in communities with poor air quality. The purpose of this survey was to compare the pulmonary function of children living in urban area of Tirana city with children living in suburban area of the city.
Material and methods
This survey is carried out during 2004–2005 period on 238 children living in urban area and in 72 children living in suburban area, measuring dynamic pulmonary function. A questionnaire was used to collect data on sex, current respiratory symptoms, allergy diagnosed by the physician, parent education and smoking habit of parents, presence of animals, synthetic carpets and moulds in their houses. The selection of schools, and children included in this survey was done by randomized method. Also, we have measured and classic air pollutants.
Results
Comparing the results of values of pulmonary function of two groups of children, we have shown that differences were significant (p 0.001), whereas comparing symptoms were for cough (p 0.011) and for phlegm (p 0.032). The level of particulate matter (PM10) and total suspended matter (TSP) were over the recommended limit values, whereas the levels of other pollutants have resulted within recommended levels of World Health Organization (WHO)
Conclusions
The results of this survey suggest that air pollution is associated with respiratory health of children causing a slight decrease in values of pulmonary function in children of urban area compared with those of suburban area.},

abstract = {Aim
To access the relationship between the frequency of hospitalizations due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and air pollution.
Material-method
Time series study during a seven year period (2001–2007) in a semi-urban tourist Greek peninsula. Data were collected from the computerized database of Volos General Hospital and included on a daily basis all emergency admissions of adults (>14 years old) which required hospitalization due to respiratory or cardiovascular problems. Daily concentrations of ambient pollutants [particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mm (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NO, NO2, NOX) and ozone (O3)] were obtained from three monitoring stations. The impact of air pollutants on morbidity was studied through time series analysis. The effects of time trend, season, and other cyclical factors, temperature, and humidity were accounted for. Autocorrelation and overdispersion were corrected.
Results
There were significant associations between hospitalizations and all indicators of air pollution. Daily elevations in the concentrations of PM10, NO, CO and O3 increased significantly the number of hospitalizations for respiratory/cardiovascular causes both on the same day and at the next day (p < 0.05). Combined increase of CO and O3 and of PM10 and CO was associated with even higher hospitalization rates.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest a significant relationship between morbidity burden of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and the levels of air pollution; these results underline that reinforcement of measures which target to control ambient pollution, is necessary.},

This study presents indoor and outdoor combustion pollutants (CO and NOx) and respirable particulate matter–RSPM (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0) concentrations measured during winter and summer seasons in 8 homes in Delhi, India. CO2 concentrations have been used to measure the outdoor airflow rates. This study further investigates variations in indoor/outdoor concentrations of the pollutants as a result of various activities in commercial (Site I) and institutional areas (Site II). The institutional area has been considered as the control site. Monitoring has been conducted at each site for 3 days in a week in both summer and winter seasons to investigate the diurnal variations of pollutant concentrations. Then, the I/O ratios have also been estimated. The correlation analysis of indoor pollutant concentrations with outdoor concentrations has been carried out. Winter/Summer (W/S) ratios have also been calculated and a two tailed t–test has been used to determine whether the winter and summer mean concentrations are significantly higher. The I/O ratios for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0 at Site I homes, in winter season, have been found to be 1.43±0.84, 2.72±1.94 and 3.21±2.39, respectively. I/O ratio for CO has been found to be 2.99±2.19 in winters at Site I. The linear regression analysis results have revealed that usage of biomass fuels for cooking has increased the concentrations of RSPM and CO indoors, considerably in winter. W/S ratios for RSPM have also been found to be higher than 1.0 at almost all the homes indicating that the concentration of RSPM is higher in winter season. Regression analysis results indicated that the major sources for RSPM and CO exist indoors and that is principally, cooking using the biomass as fuels and also cleaning of homes manually, particularly at commercial site (NZM site). The results of this study also suggest that the indoor RSPM concentrations are mainly composed of the finer range of particles.},

Air pollution has been associated with adverse cardiovascular effects.
Objective
To measure the association between air pollution, spirometry, blood pressure, and exercise capacity.
Methods
We used data from 5604 subjects collected during the Canada Health Measures Survey to test the association between air pollution measured on the day of the survey and spirometry (n=5011 subjects), blood pressure, and exercise capacity (n=3789 subjects).
Results
An interquartile range (IQR) increase in ozone (17.0ppb) was significantly associated with a 0.883% higher resting heart rate, a 0.718% higher systolic and 0.407% higher diastolic blood pressure, a 0.393% lower FEV1/FVC expressed as a percentage of predicted, and a 1.52% reduction in the aerobic fitness score (p<0.05). Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure were approximately 0.5mmHg higher for an (IQR 4.5$\mu$g/m3) increase in PM2.5 (IQR 4.5$\mu$g/m3) and 1mmHg higher for a 12.6ppb increase in NO2 (IQR 12.6ppb). An increase in PM2.5 was also associated with an approximate 0.4% decrease in percent predicted FEV1 and FVC (p<0.05).
Conclusion
Exposure to higher concentrations of air pollution was associated with higher resting blood pressure and lower ventilatory function. Ozone was associated with reduced exercise capacity.},

abstract = {The aim of the study is to analyse the joint effect of biological (pollen) and chemical air pollutants, as well as meteorological variables, on the hospital admissions of respiratory problems for the Szeged region in Southern Hungary. The data set used covers a nine-year period (1999–2007) and is unique in the sense that it includes—besides the daily number of respiratory hospital admissions—not just the hourly mean concentrations of CO, PM10, NO, NO2, O3 and SO2 with meteorological variables (temperature, global solar flux, relative humidity, air pressure and wind speed), but two pollen variables (Ambrosia and total pollen excluding Ambrosia) as well. The analysis was performed using three age categories for the pollen season of Ambrosia and the pollen-free season. Meteorological elements and air pollutants are clustered in order to define optimum environmental conditions of high patient numbers. ANOVA was then used to determine whether cluster-related mean patient numbers differ significantly. Furthermore, two novel procedures are applied here: factor analysis including a special transformation and a time-varying multivariate linear regression that makes it possible to determine the rank of importance of the influencing variables in respiratory hospital admissions, and also compute the relative importance of the parameters affecting respiratory disorders. Both techniques revealed that Ambrosia pollen is an important variable that influences hospital admissions (an increase of 10 pollen grains m−3 can imply an increase of around 24% in patient numbers). The role of chemical and meteorological parameters is also significant, but their weights vary according to the seasons and the methods. Clearer results are obtained for the pollination season of Ambrosia. Here, a 10 $\mu$g m−3 increase in O3 implies a patient number response from −17% to +11%. Wind speed is a surprisingly important variable, where a 1 m s−1 rise may result in a hospital admission reduction of up to 42–45%.},

We found a significant association between particles and respiratory infections. This relationship was affected by mean temperature, atmospheric pressure and wind speed. These effects were stronger in fall, winter and spring for upper respiratory infections while for lower respiratory infections the association was significant only during spring. Low socio-economic conditions and low education levels increased the risk of respiratory infections.

abstract = {Fine particulate matter samples were collected in an urban ambient fixed site and, outside and inside residencies in Athens greater area, Greece. n-Alkanes, iso/anteiso-alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The values of concentration diagnostic ratios indicated a mixture of vehicular emissions, fuel evaporation, oil residues and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in outdoor and indoor samples. Particulate iso/anteiso-alkanes, specific tracers of ETS, were detected in both non-smoking and smoking households. The indoor-to-outdoor ratios of particulate iso/anteiso-alkanes and unresolved complex mixture (a tracer of outdoor air pollution) in non-smoking households were comparable to the measured air exchange rate. This suggested that penetration of outdoor air was solely responsible for the detection of tobacco smoke particulate tracers in indoor non-smoking environments. Overall, residential outdoor concentrations accounted for a large fraction (from 25 up to 79%) of indoor aliphatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Open windows/doors and the operation of an air condition unit yielded also in higher indoor concentrations than those measured outdoors.},

abstract = {Background
Few studies have examined the acute cardiorespiratory effects of specific volatile organic compound (VOC) exposures from traffic pollution.
Methods
A cross-over study was conducted among 42 healthy adults during summer 2010 in Ottawa, Canada. Participants cycled for 1-h along high and low-traffic routes and VOC exposures were determined along each route. Lung function, exhaled nitric oxide, and heart rate variability were monitored before cycling and 1–4h after the start of cycling. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to examine the relationship between 26 VOCs and acute changes in clinical outcomes adjusted for potential confounding factors.
Results
Each inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in propane/butane exposure was associated with a 2.0millisecond (ms) (95% CI: 0.65, 3.2) increase in SDNN (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals), a 24ms2 (95% CI: 6.6, 41) increase in HF (high frequency power), and a 65ms2 (95% CI: 11, 118) increase in LF (low frequency power) in the hours following cycling. IQR increases in ethane and isoprene were associated with a 5.8ms (95% CI: −9.8, −1.7): decrease in SDNN and a 24ms2 (95% CI: −44, −7.9) decrease in HF, respectively. IQR increases in benzene exposure were associated with a 1.7ppb (95% CI: 1.1, 2.3) increase in exhaled nitric oxide and each IQR increase in 3-methylhexane exposure was associated with a 102mL (95% CI: −157, −47) decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1-s.
Conclusions
Exposure to traffic-related VOCs may contribute to acute changes in lung function, inflammation, or heart rate variability.},

abstract = {Background
The use of biomass for cooking and heating is considered an important factor associated with respiratory diseases. However, few studies evaluate the amount of particulate matter less than 2.5$\mu$m in diameter (PM2.5), symptoms and lung function in the same population.
Objectives
To evaluate the respiratory effects of biomass combustion and compare the results with those of individuals from the same community in Brazil using liquefied petroleum gas (Gas).
Methods
1402 individuals in 260 residences were divided into three groups according to exposure (Gas, Indoor-Biomass, Outside-Biomass). Respiratory symptoms were assessed using questionnaires. Reflectance of paper filters was used to assess particulate matter exposure. In 48 residences the amount of PM2.5 was also quantified. Pulmonary function tests were performed in 120 individuals.
Results
Reflectance index correlated directly with PM2.5 (r=0.92) and was used to estimate exposure (ePM2.5). There was a significant increase in ePM2.5 in Indoor-Biomass and Outside-Biomass, compared to Gas. There was a significantly increased odds ratio (OR) for cough, wheezing and dyspnea in adults exposed to Indoor-Biomass (OR=2.93, 2.33, 2.59, respectively) and Outside-Biomass (OR=1.78, 1.78, 1.80, respectively) compared to Gas. Pulmonary function tests revealed both Non-Smoker-Biomass and Smoker-Gas individuals to have decreased %predicted-forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) as compared to Non-Smoker-Gas . Pulmonary function tests data was inversely correlated with duration and ePM2.5. The prevalence of airway obstruction was 20% in both Non-Smoker-Biomass and Smoker-Gas subjects.
Conclusion
Chronic exposure to biomass combustion is associated with increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms, reduced lung function and development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These effects are associated with the duration and magnitude of exposure and are exacerbated by tobacco smoke.},

Exposure to high levels of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5$\mu$m (PM2.5) resulting from biomass burning is frequent in the subequatorial Amazon region.
Objective
To investigate whether or not current exposure to PM2.5 in the Brazilian Amazon has adverse effects on the daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) of schoolchildren.
Methods
The study design consisted of a panel comprising 309 children aged 6 to 15 years from the same school. PEF was measured daily, except weekends and holidays, from August to December 2006. Each child contributed to the study up to 67 daily measurements. All together there were 19115 PEF measures. Participation rate was 90%. Daily measurements of PM2.5, temperature, and humidity as well as passive smoking, and subject features were regarded in the statistical analysis. Various exposures of PM2.5 were considered throughout the analysis, among them 24-hour, 12-hour, 6-hour, and 5-hour means. To account for subject responses to confounders, mixed effects models were applied. The effects were evaluated considering air pollution levels on the current day or at 1- or 2-day lags and the averages of 0–1-day lags, 1–2-day lags and 0-, 1-, and 2-day lags.
Results
The 24-hour PM2.5 means ranged from 6.39 to 99.91$\mu$g/m3. The adjusted models for the entire group of children revealed adverse effects. For instance, for an increase of 10$\mu$g/m3 in PM2.5, the reduction in the PEF average varied between 0.26l/min (95% Confidence Interval (CI): −0.49; −0.04) and 0.38l/min (95% CI: −0.71; −0.04). Restricted to the subgroup of non-asthmatic children, classified as such according to the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire, there was a reduction in the PEF ranging from 0.38l/min (95% CI: −0.63; −0.13) to 0.53l/min (95% CI: −0.90; −0.16) for an increase of 10$\mu$g/m3 in PM2.5. There was no significant effect in the asthmatic group. When stratified by time of the day children were at school, the concurrent effects of air pollution on PEF were not significant, whereas the 6-hour exposure from 0am to 5:30am was significant for both morning and afternoon groups. Finally, the 24-hour mean lagged effect was only significant for the afternoon group of children. For an increase of 10$\mu$g/m3 in PM2.5, there was a reduction in the PEF that ranged from 0.41l/min (95% CI: −0.76; −0.06) to 0.49l/min (95% CI: −0.91; −0.07).
Conclusion
Exposure to current levels of PM2.5 in the Brazilian Amazon was associated with reductions in the lung function of schoolchildren. The adverse effects were more consistent in non-asthmatic children and with respect to the 6-hour mean from 0am to 5.30am.},

abstract = {Background
Asthma affects more than 17 million people in the United States;1/3 of these are children. Children are particularly vulnerable to airborne pollution because of their narrower airways and because they generally breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults, increasing their exposure to air pollutants. However, the results from previous studies on the association between motor vehicle emissions and the development of childhood wheeze and asthma are conflicting. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify their potential relationship.
Methods
MEDLINE, Highwire, and The Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant studies. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between traffic air pollutants and wheeze or asthma were retrieved from individual studies and pooled to generate summary effect estimates (meta-OR) in STATA 11.1.
Results
Nineteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide (meta-OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00–1.11), nitrous oxide (meta-OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00–1.04), and carbon monoxide (meta-OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01–1.12) were positively associated with a higher prevalence of childhood asthma. Exposure to sulfur dioxide (meta-OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01–1.07) was positively associated with a higher prevalence of wheeze in children. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide was positively associated with a higher incidence of childhood asthma (meta-OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.06–1.24), and exposures to particulate matter was positively associated with a higher incidence of wheeze in children (meta-OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.04–1.07).
Conclusions
Living or attending schools near high traffic density roads exposes children to higher levels of motor vehicle air pollutants, and increases the incidence and prevalence of childhood asthma and wheeze.},

abstract = {Objective
This study investigated whether outpatient visits of acute upper respiratory infections for children aged less than 15 years are associated with temperature, air pollutants and circulating respiratory viruses in Taipei, Taiwan, from 2003 to 2007.
Methods
Outpatient records for acute upper respiratory infections (ICD9 CM codes: 460, 462, 463,464, 465.9 and 487) in a randomly selected sample (n=39,766 children in 2005) was used to estimate the cumulative relative risks (RR) associated with average temperature lasting for 8 days (lag 0–7 days), air pollutants (NO2, O3 and PM2.5) lasting for 6 days (lag 0–5 days), and virus-specific positive isolation rate lasting for 11 days (lag 0–10 days) using distributed lag non-linear models after controlling for relative humidity, wind speed, day of week, holiday effects and long-term trend.
Results
Average temperature of 33°C was associated with the lowest risk for outpatient visits of acute upper respiratory infections. Relative to 33°C, cumulative 8-day RR was highest at 15°C of ambient average temperature [RR=1.94; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.78, 2.11]. With the first quartile as reference, cumulative 6-day RRs were 1.25 (95% CI: 1.21, 1.29) for NO2, 1.04 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.06) for O3, and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.03) for PM2.5 at the 95th percentile. Per-standard deviation (SD) increase of virus-specific isolation rate for influenza type A (SD=13.2%), type B (SD=8.76%), and adenoviruses (SD=5.25%) revealed statistical significance for overall 11-day RRs of 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.03), 1.05 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.06) and 1.04 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.05), respectively.
Conclusions
Current study suggested a positive association between outpatient visits for acute upper respiratory infections and ambient environment factors, including average temperature, air pollutants, and circulating respiratory viruses.},

abstract = {Little is known about the health impact of air pollution on children's cardiovascular health. A cross-sectional study was conducted and data was analysed in 2048 Chinese schoolchildren (aged 8–10 years) in three districts of Hong Kong to examine the association between exposure to outdoor air pollution and cardiorespiratory fitness. Annual means of ambient PM10, SO2, NO2 and O3 from 1996 to 2003 were used to estimate individual exposure of the subjects. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured for maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), predicted by the multistage fitness test (MFT). Height and weight were measured and other potential confounders were collected with questionnaires. Analysis of covariance was performed to estimate the impact of air pollution on complete speed in the MFT and predicted VO2max. The results showed that children in high-pollution district had significantly lower complete speed and predicted VO2max compared to those in low- and moderate-pollution districts. Complete speed and predicted VO2max was estimated to reduce 0.327 km h−1 and 1.53 ml kg−1 min−1 per 10 $\mu$g m−3 increase in PM10 annual mean respectively, with those in girls being greater than in boys. Being physically active could not significantly result in improved cardiorespiratory fitness in polluted districts. The adverse effect seems to be independent of short-term exposure to air pollution. We concluded that long-term exposure to higher outdoor air pollution levels was negatively associated with cardiorespiratory fitness in Chinese schoolchildren, especially for girls. PM10 is the most relevant pollutant of the adverse effect. Elevated cardiorespiratory fitness observed in physically activate children could be negated by increased amount of inhaled pollutants during exercise.},

abstract = {Background
Ambient fine particulate air pollution has been associated with impaired lung function, but the chemical components behind the association are not well understood.
Objectives
We investigated the short-term effects of various air pollutants and chemical components of ambient fine particles (PM2.5) on lung function in a panel of 40 healthy university students.
Methods
The study subjects underwent biweekly spirometry tests for 12 times before and after their natural relocation from a suburban area to an urban area with changing air pollution levels and contents in Beijing, China. We estimated the short-term air pollution effects on lung function by applying four different mixed-effects models: single-pollutant model, component-PM2.5 joint model (two-pollutant model), component residual model, and exposure partitioned model.
Results
Among the air pollutants, PM2.5 showed the most robust estimated effects on different lung function measures in a similar action pattern. Most air pollutants and PM2.5 chemical components were positively associated with lung function measures at a short-term averaging time (3-d moving average) and inversely associated with them at a longer averaging time (14-d moving average). We found consistent positive associations between chloride, zinc, copper, vanadium, lead, stannum and different lung function measures at 3-d moving average. We also found consistent inverse associations between calcium, magnesium and peak expiratory flow at 14-d moving average.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that PM2.5 and several metallic components may be the major air pollutants that contribute to the lung function changes. These findings may help achieve a better understanding of the features of a complex air pollution mixture that are most deleterious to health, and may also have implications for more targeted and effective pollution regulations aiming to improve the public health.},

abstract = {In the developing world, indoor air pollution (IAP) created from solid fuel used in traditional biomass cook stoves is a leading contributor of poor respiratory health, global burden of disease, and greenhouse pollutant emissions. In the present study, we piloted an experimental cross-sectional monitoring and evaluation design with 30 households in rural Lijiang and Deqin counties in northwest Yunnan province, China. This approach offers the ability to examine the effectiveness of improved cook stove (ICS) programs with a much smaller sample size than the typical population based pre- and post-intervention study that requires a large sample representative of the population. Continuous PM2.5 was measured with the UCB (currently known as UCB-PATS) and the TSI DustTrak and continuous CO was measured with the HOBO CO logger. Using the traditional method of cooking and heating, mean 24-h PM2.5 and CO concentrations in the kitchen were measured in the range of 0.15–0.71 mg m−3 for PM2.5 and 3.0–11 ppm for CO. These concentrations were compared to using a combination of improved stoves in the kitchen where PM2.5 and CO concentrations were measured in the range of 0.08–0.18 mg m−3 for PM2.5 and 0.7–5.5 ppm for CO. These concentrations yielded statistically significant reduction in IAP when replacing the traditional fireplace or traditional stove with an improved stove combination. Finally, we show a strong correlation between CO and PM2.5 (R2 = 0.72–0.76). The combination of this experimental design along with the monitoring and evaluation protocol presented here may provide a robust framework to rapidly assess the effectiveness of ICS interventions in progress.},

@article{Bates2013,
abstract = {Background
Whether long-term, low-level hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas is a cause of health effects, including asthma, is uncertain. Rotorua city, New Zealand, has the largest population exposed, from geothermal sources, to relatively high ambient levels of H2S. In a cross-sectional study, the authors investigated associations with asthma in this population.
Methods
A total of 1637 adults, aged 18–65 years, were enrolled during 2008–2010. Residences and workplaces were geocoded. H2S exposures at homes and workplaces were estimated using city-wide networks of passive H2S samplers and kriging to create exposure surfaces. Exposure metrics were based on (1) time-weighted exposures at home and work; and (2) the maximum exposure (home or work). Exposure estimates were entered as quartiles into regression models, with covariate data.
Results
Neither exposure metric showed evidence of increased asthma risk from H2S. However, some suggestion of exposure-related reduced risks for diagnosed asthma and asthma symptoms, particularly wheezing during the last 12 months, emerged. With the maximum exposure metric, the prevalence ratio for wheeze in the highest exposure quartile was 0.80 (0.65, 0.99) and, for current asthma treatment, 0.75 (0.52, 1.08). There was no evidence that this was caused by a “survivor effect”.
Conclusions
The study provided no evidence that asthma risk increases with H2S exposure. Suggestions of a reduced risk in the higher exposure areas are consistent with recent evidence that H2S has signaling functions in the body, including induction of smooth muscle relaxation and reduction of inflammation. Study limitations, including possible confounding, preclude definitive conclusions.},

abstract = {Recent studies have implicated that air pollution has been associated with asthma exacerbations. However, the key link between specific air pollutant and the consequent impact on asthma has not been shown. The purpose of this study was to quantify the fluctuations in air pollution time-series dynamics to correlate the relationships between statistical indicators and age-specific asthma hospital admissions. An indicators-based regression model was developed to predict the time-trend of asthma hospital admissions in Taiwan in the period 1998–2010. Five major pollutants such as particulate matters with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 $\mu$m (PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) were included. We used Spearman's rank correlation to detect the relationships between time-series based statistical indicators of standard deviation, coefficient of variation, skewness, and kurtosis and monthly asthma hospitalization. We further used the indicators-guided Poisson regression model to test and predict the impact of target air pollutants on asthma incidence. Here we showed that standard deviation of PM10 data was the most correlated indicators for asthma hospitalization for all age groups, particularly for elderly. The skewness of O3 data gives the highest correlation to adult asthmatics. The proposed regression model shows a better predictability in annual asthma hospitalization trends for pediatrics. Our results suggest that a set of statistical indicators inferred from time-series information of major air pollutants can provide advance risk warning signals in complex air pollution-asthma systems and aid in asthma management that depends heavily on monitoring the dynamics of asthma incidence and environmental stimuli.},

abstract = {Although formaldehyde is a common indoor pollutant, its impact on respiratory symptoms in childhood remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the relation between domestic formaldehyde exposure and occurrence of coughing, one of the most prevalent respiratory symptoms during the first year of life of infants from the PARIS birth cohort involving 3840 healthy full-term babies. The presence of respiratory symptoms, including dry cough at night apart from a cold or chest infection in the past 12 months was reported on a standardized health questionnaire. Formaldehyde exposure was estimated for all infants using a predictive model established from data (both repeated measurements and information about determinants of levels) collected in a random sample of infants from the cohort. An unconditional logistic regression was fitted to study the relation between annual domestic formaldehyde exposure and dry cough at night, adjusting for all potential risk factors/confounders. The prevalence of dry cough at night was 14.9%. Parental history of allergy was found to modify the relation between environmental factors and dry cough. Cockroaches, used mattresses, and family stressor events were associated with dry cough in infants with parental allergy history. Conversely, domestic formaldehyde exposure tended to increase occurrence of dry cough at night only among babies without parental history of allergy (adjusted OR per 10µg/m3 increase in levels, single imputation approach: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.08–1.96, and Bayesian approach: 1.12, 0.91–1.36). This study suggests that the impact of indoor environmental exposure on dry cough at night in infancy is different depending on the presence or not of parental history of allergy.},

We tested the hypothesis whether chronic exposure to air pollution of volcanogenic origin causes lung injury, using wild mice (Mus musculus) as model. Lung injury was determined using histological morphometric parameters, inflammatory status (InfS) and the amount of black silver deposits (BSD). Mice exposed to volcanogenic air pollution have decreased percentage of alveolar space, alveolar perimeter and lung structural functionality (LSF) ratio and, increased alveolar septal thickness, amount of BSD and InfS. For the first time it is evidenced that non-eruptive active volcanism has a high potential to cause lung injury. This study also highlights the usefulness of M. musculus as bioindicator species, and of the developed biomarker of effect LSF ratio, for future animal and/or human biomonitoring programs.},

Respiratory health and allergies in children living near petrochemical sites have not been extensively studied. We evaluated the association between residential proximity to the petrochemical site of Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain) and the prevalence of asthma, respiratory symptoms and lung function in children. Children aged 6–7 (n=2672) and adolescents aged 13–14 (n=2524) residing near two large petrochemical sites and those living in a city with medium vehicular traffic were cross-sectionally compared with children from an area with low vehicular traffic and without industry. The prevalence of symptoms was measured using the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood written and video questionnaires. Lung function measurements were done in a subsample of 959 adolescents in the four areas. Multivariable analyses were done to estimate the effects of the residential area on symptoms and lung function adjusted for potential confounders. Crude prevalence of symptoms was similar across the studied areas. After adjustment, children and adolescents living near a petrochemical site had a statistically significant higher prevalence of respiratory hospitalizations in the previous year (Prevalence Ratio (PR)=1.49; 95%CI, 1.06–2.09) and of nocturnal cough (PR=1.29; 95%CI 1.05–1.57), respectively. Reduced lung function values among adolescents residing near the petrochemical areas were not observed. Although a higher prevalence of asthma in children and adolescents living near the petrochemical sites could not be demonstrated, as described in other studies, respiratory hospitalizations and nocturnal cough could be related to short-term exposures to pollutants.

Little is known about whether or not pet ownership modifies the relationship between air pollutants and respiratory symptoms and asthma in children. In order to evaluate the interaction between pet and air pollution on respiratory health in children, we recruited 30,149 children, aged 2–12 years, from 25 districts of seven cities in northeast China. Parents of the children completed questionnaires that characterized the children's histories of respiratory symptoms and illnesses and associated risk factors. Average ambient annual exposures to particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) were estimated from monitoring stations in each of the 25 study districts. The results showed that among children without pets at home, there were statistically significant associations between both recent exacerbations of asthma among physician-diagnosed asthmatics and respiratory symptoms and all pollutants examined. Odds ratios (ORs) ranged from 1.12 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.00–1.26] to 1.41 (95% CI, 1.24–1.61) per 31 $\mu$g m−3 for PM10, whereas, among children with pets at home, there were no effects or small effects for either asthma or the symptoms. The interactions between dog ownership and PM10, SO2, NO2, and O3 were statistically significant, such that children with a dog at home had lower reporting of both current asthma and current wheeze.

abstract = {Objective
We investigated associations of short-term changes in ambient ozone (O3), fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and the timing of new-onset asthma, using a large, high-risk population in an area with historically high ozone levels.
Methods
The study population included 18,289 incident asthma cases identified among Medicaid-enrolled children in Harris County Texas between 2005–2007, using Medicaid Analytic Extract enrollment and claims files. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression to assess the effect of increased short-term pollutant concentrations on the timing of asthma onset.
Results
Each 10ppb increase in ozone was significantly associated with new-onset asthma during the warm season (May–October), with the strongest association seen when a 6-day cumulative average period was used as the exposure metric (odds ratio [OR]=1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–1.08). Similar results were seen for NO2 and PM2.5 (OR=1.07, 95% CI, 1.03–1.11 and OR=1.12, 95% CI, 1.03–1.22, respectively), and PM2.5 also had significant effects in the cold season (November–April), 5-day cumulative lag (OR=1.11. 95% CI, 1.00–1.22). Significantly increased ORs for O3 and NO2 during the warm season persisted in co-pollutant models including PM2.5. Race and age at diagnosis modified associations between ozone and onset of asthma.
Conclusion

abstract = {Objectives
Increased air pollutant concentrations have been linked to several asthma-related outcomes in children, including respiratory symptoms, medication use, and hospital visits. However, few studies have examined effects of ultrafine particles in a pediatric population. Our primary objective was to examine the effects of ambient concentrations of ultrafine particles on asthma exacerbation among urban children and determine whether consistent treatment with inhaled corticosteroids could attenuate these effects. We also explored the relationship between asthma exacerbation and ambient concentrations of accumulation mode particles, fine particles (≤2.5 micrograms [$\mu$m]; PM2.5), carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone. We hypothesized that increased 1–7 day concentrations of ultrafine particles and other pollutants would be associated with increases in the relative odds of an asthma exacerbation, but that this increase in risk would be attenuated among children receiving school-based corticosteroid therapy.
Methods
We conducted a pilot study using data from 3 to 10 year-old children participating in the School-Based Asthma Therapy trial. Using a time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression, we estimated the relative odds of a pediatric asthma visit treated with prednisone (n=96 visits among 74 children) associated with increased pollutant concentrations in the previous 7 days. We re-ran these analyses separately for children receiving medications through the school-based intervention and children in a usual care control group.
Results
Interquartile range increases in ultrafine particles and carbon monoxide concentrations in the previous 7 days were associated with increases in the relative odds of a pediatric asthma visit, with the largest increases observed for 4-day mean ultrafine particles (interquartile range=2088p/cm3; OR=1.27; 95% CI=0.90–1.79) and 7-day mean carbon monoxide (interquartile range=0.17ppm; OR=1.63; 95% CI=1.03–2.59). Relative odds estimates were larger among children receiving school-based inhaled corticosteroid treatment. We observed no such associations with accumulation mode particles, black carbon, fine particles (≤2.5$\mu$m), or sulfur dioxide. Ozone concentrations were inversely associated with the relative odds of a pediatric asthma visit.
Conclusions
These findings suggest a response to markers of traffic pollution among urban asthmatic children. Effects were strongest among children receiving preventive medications through school, suggesting that this group of children was particularly sensitive to environmental triggers. Medication adherence alone may be insufficient to protect the most vulnerable from environmental asthma triggers. However, further research is necessary to confirm this finding.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies indicate that asthmatic children are more susceptible to traffic-related air pollution exposure than non-asthmatic children. Local and systemic inflammation in combination with oxidative stress have been suggested as a possible susceptibility factor. We investigated effect modification by asthma status for the association between air pollution exposure and systemic effects using whole blood cytokine responsiveness as an inflammatory marker. The study was nested within the two German birth cohort studies GINIplus and LISAplus and initially designed as a random sub-sample enriched with asthmatic children. Using data from 27 asthmatic and 59 non-asthmatic six-year-old children we measured the production of Interleukin-6 (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in whole blood after ex-vivo stimulation with urban particulate matter (EHC-93). Air pollution exposure (nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <10$\mu$m (PM10), particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5$\mu$m (PM2.5mass), coarse particulate matter (PMcoarse) and PM2.5absorbance (PM2.5abs)) was modelled for children´s home addresses applying land-use regression. To assess effect modification by asthma status linear regression models with multiplicative interaction terms were used. In asthmatics exposure to NO2 was associated with higher production of pro-inflammatory cytokines: adjusted means ratio (MR) 2.22 (95% confidence interval 1.22–4.04) for IL-6 per 2.68µg/m³ NO2. The interaction term between asthma status and NO2 exposure was significant. Results for NOx, PM10, PM2.5mass and PM2.5abs were in the same direction. No association between air pollution and cytokine responsiveness was found in the group of non-asthmatic children and in the overall group. Traffic-related air pollution exposure is associated with higher pro-inflammatory cytokine responsiveness in whole blood of asthmatic children.},

abstract = {Background
China has experienced increasingly severe levels of air pollution in the past decades, yet studies on the health effects of air pollution in China at a national study level, remain limited. This study assess the sub-chronic effect of ambient air pollution on respiratory mortality in the 32 largest Chinese cities.
Methods
We employ two-way fixed effects panel data analysis and monthly air pollution and mortality panel data. We estimate associations between monthly respiratory mortality and air pollution; pollution is defined as particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <10$\mu$m. We adjust for city characteristics, seasonality (monthly effects), and weather conditions (precipitation and temperature). We examine the associations between monthly injury mortality and air pollution to check for robustness.
Results
The results show positive and statistically significant associations of air pollution with respiratory mortality. During the study period (2006–2010) a 10$\mu$g/m3 increase in monthly PM10 concentration is associated with a 1.05% (95% CI, 0.08–2.04%) increase in adult respiratory mortality rate. The air pollution effect is the most salient in northern cities (with central heating system) during the cold season (October–April); a 10$\mu$g/m3 increase in monthly PM10 concentrations is associated with a 1.62% (95% CI, 0.22–3.46%) increase in the elderly respiratory mortality rate. There is no statistically significant association between the young adult respiratory mortality and air pollution.
Conclusions
The elderly respiratory mortality rate in China is positively and statistically significantly associated with air pollution. The effect is largest in northern cities during cold months when coal is burned for heating.},

Air pollution and tobacco smoke can induce negative effects on the human health and often leads to the formation of oxidative stress.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to clarify the role of the urbanization degree and of passive exposure to tobacco smoke in the formation of oxidative stress. Thus, a group of non-smoking adolescents was recruited among those who live and attend school in areas with three different population densities. To each subject a spot of urine was collected to quantify 15-F2t isoprostane as a marker of oxidative stress and cotinine as a marker of passive exposure to tobacco smoke. Furthermore, respiratory functionality was also measured.
Results
Multiple linear regression analysis results showed a direct correlation (p<0.0001) of 15-F2t isoprostane with both the urbanization and passive smoke. Lung function parameters proved significantly lower for the subjects living in the most populous city of Torino.
Conclusion
This remarks the negative effect that urbanization has on the respiratory conditions. Lastly, lung functionality presented a low inverse correlation with 15-F2t isoprostane, suggesting an independent mechanism than that of the urban factor.},

abstract = {Regular exercise improves physiological processes and yields positive health outcomes. However, it is relatively less known that exposure to air pollution during outdoor exercises may actually exacerbate several health problems. The present cross–sectional study was undertaken to assess the particulate matter (PM) in the ambient air and its association with lung functions, pulse rate and respiratory problems among 378 outdoor exercisers in the National Capital Region (NCR), India. Lung functions were measured using a Spirometer (PIKO–1, PIKO–6) and respiratory problems were recorded through a questionnaire–based survey. Concentrations of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 and 1 microns were monitored at 10 locations across the study area using an online automated ambient air monitoring instrument–HAZ–DUST (EPAM–5000). Decline in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 sec–FEV1 (p<0.001) and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate–PEFR (p<0.001) was observed among the outdoor exercisers compared to the Indian reference values. Ambient air monitoring showed higher PM2.5 concentrations at all the study locations compared to the recommended permissible levels for residential areas in India. Risk of FEV1 (%) predicted cases with <80% showed an increase from 2.32% to 8.69% among the exercisers with respect to PM1 concentration from lower to higher limit at the study locations. Similarly, PEFR showed an increased risk of predicted cases <80% from 0.78% to 2.91% among outside exercisers for lower to higher limit of PM1 concentration. Cases with FEV1 predicted <80% increased from 2.56% to 13.98% and for PEFR from 0.96% to 5.24% among outdoor exercisers for the corresponding lower to higher limits of PM2.5 concentrations. The study demonstrates that outdoor exercisers in locations with high PM concentrations are at a risk of lung function impairment. These impairments are due to deposition of PM in the smaller and larger airways.},

Early life is suggested to be a critical time in determining subsequent asthma development, but the extent to which the effect of early-life exposure to ambient air pollution on childhood asthma is unclear.
Objectives
We investigated doctor-diagnosed asthma in preschool children due to exposure to ambient air pollution in utero and during the first year of life.
Methods
In total 2490 children aged 3–6 years participated in a questionnaire study regarding doctor-diagnosed asthma between September 2011 and January 2012 in China. Children's exposure to critical air pollutants, sulfur dioxide (SO2) as proxy of industrial air pollution, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as proxy of traffic pollution, and particulate matter≤10µm in diameter (PM10) as a mixture, was estimated from the concentrations measured at the ambient air quality monitoring stations by using an inverse distance weighted (IDW) method. Logistic regression analysis was employed to determine the relationship between early-life exposure and childhood asthma in terms of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
Results
Association between early-life exposure to air pollutants and childhood asthma was observed. SO2 and NO2 had significant associations with adjusted OR (95% CI) of 1.45 (1.02–2.07) and 1.74 (1.15–2.62) in utero and 1.62 (1.01–2.60) and 1.90 (1.20–3.00) during the first year for per 50µg/m3 and 15µg/m3 increase respectively. Exposure to the combined high level of SO2 and NO2 in China significantly elevated the asthmatic risk with adjusted OR (95% CI) of 1.76 (1.18–2.64) in utero and 1.85 (1.22–2.79) during the first year compared to the low level exposure. The associations were higher for males and the younger children aged 3–4 than females and the older children aged 5–6.
Conclusions
Early-life exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with childhood asthma during which the level and source of air pollution play important roles. The high level and nature of combined industrial and traffic air pollution in China may contribute to the recent rapid increase of childhood asthma.},

Concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOC), aldehydes, PM2.5, PM10, carbon dioxide, bacteria and fungi were assessed in 73 classrooms from 20 public primary schools located in Porto, Portugal. Children who attended the selected classrooms (n = 1134) were evaluated by a standardised health questionnaire completed by the legal guardians; spirometry and exhaled nitric oxide tests. The results indicated that no classrooms presented individual VOC pollutant concentrations higher than the WHO IAQ guidelines or by INDEX recommendations; while PM2.5, PM10 and bacteria levels exceeded the WHO air quality guidelines or national limit values. High levels of total VOC, acetaldehyde, PM2.5 and PM10 were associated with higher odds of wheezing in children. Thus, indoor air pollutants, some even at low exposure levels, were related with the development of respiratory symptoms. The results pointed out that it is crucial to take into account the unique characteristics of the public primary schools, to develop appropriate control strategies in order to reduce the exposure to indoor air pollutants and, therefore, to minimize the adverse health effects.},

We developed single air pollutant models, adjusted for the effect of aeroallergens and stratified by synoptic weather type, and pooled relative risk estimates for asthma hospitalisation in ten Canadian cities. Aeroallergens significantly modified the relative risk in 19 pollutant-weather type combinations, reducing the size and variance for each single pollutant model.

Particle size distributions (5.6–560 nm, electrical mobility diameter) near a major road in Beijing were measured by the TSI Fast Mobility Particle Sizer (FMPS). The information of size distributions provided by FMPS was applied in the Multiple-Path Particle Dosimetry model (MPPD) to quantify number and mass depositions of particles in human airway including extrathoracic (ET), tracheobronchial (TB), and pulmonary (PUL) regions of exposed Chinese in Beijing. Our results show that under ambient conditions, particle number concentration (NC) deposition in PUL is the highest in the three major regions of human airway. The total particle NC deposition in human airway in winter is higher than that in spring, especially for ultrafine particles (1.8 times higher) while particle mass concentration (MC) deposition is higher in spring. Although particle MC in clean days are much lower than that in heavily polluted days, total particle NC deposition in human airway in clean days is comparable to that in heavily polluted days. NC deposition for nucleation mode particles (10–20 nm, aerodynamic diameter) in clean days is higher than that in heavily polluted days. MC deposition for accumulation mode particles (100–641 nm, aerodynamic diameter) in heavily polluted days is much higher than that in clean days, while that of nucleation mode is negligible. The temporal variation shows that the arithmetic mean and the median values of particle NC and MC depositions in the evening are both the highest, followed by morning and noon, and it is most likely due to increased contribution from traffic emissions.},

abstract = {Many studies have suggested that socio-economic factors are strong modifiers of human vulnerability to air pollution effects. Most of these studies were performed in developed countries, specifically in the US and Europe. Only a few studies have been performed in developing countries, and analyzed small regions (city level) with no spatial disaggregation. The aim of this study was to assess the association between vehicle emissions and cardiorespiratory disease risk in Brazil and its modification by spatial clustering of socio-economic conditions. We used a quantile regression model to estimate the risk and a geostatistical approach (K means) to execute spatial cluster analysis. We performed the risk analysis in three stages. First, we analyzed the entire study area (primary analysis), and then we conducted a spatial cluster analysis based on various municipal-level socio-economic factors, followed by a sensitivity analysis. We studied 5444 municipalities in Brazil between 2008 and 2012. Our findings showed a significant association between cardiorespiratory disease risk and vehicular emissions. We found that a 15% increase in air pollution is associated with a 6% increase in hospital admissions rates. The results from the spatial cluster analysis revealed two groups of municipalities with distinct sets of socio-economic factors and risk levels of cardiorespiratory disease related to exposure to vehicular emissions. For example, for vehicle emissions of PM in 2008, we found a relative risk of 4.18 (95% CI: 3.66, 4.93) in the primary analysis; in Group 1, the risk was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.10, 2.05) while in Group 2, the risk was 5.56 (95% CI: 4.46, 6.25). The risk in Group 2 was 480% higher than the risk in Group 1, and 35% higher than the risk in the primary analysis. Group 1 had higher values (3rd quartile) for urbanization rate, highway density, and GDP; very high values (≥3rd quartile) for population density; median values for distance from the capital; and lower values (1st quartile) for rural population density. Group 2 had lower values (1st quartile) urbanization rate; median values for highway density, GDP, and population density; between median and third quartile values for distance from the capital; and higher values (3rd quartile) for rural population density. Our findings suggest that socio-economic factors are important modifiers of the human risk of cardiorespiratory disease due to exposure to vehicle emissions in Brazil. Our study provides support for creating effective public policies related to environmental health that are targeted to high-risk populations.},

Starting from the knowledge that the main fraction of atmospheric aerosol in Rome is characterized by significant levels of PM2.5 (almost 75% of PM10 fraction is PM2.5), the paper is focused on submicron particles in such great urban area. The daytime/nighttime, work-/weekdays and cold/hot seasonal trends of submicron particles will be investigated and discussed along with NOx and total PAH drifts demonstrating the primary origin of UFPs from combustion processes. Furthermore, moving from these data, the total dose of submicron particles deposited in the respiratory system (i.e., head, tracheobronchial and alveolar regions in different lung lobes) has been estimated. Dosimeter estimates were performed with the Multiple-Path Particle Dosimetry model (MPPD v.2.1). The paper discusses the aerosol doses deposited in the respiratory system of individuals exposed in proximity of traffic. During traffic peak hours, about 6.6 × 1010 particles are deposited into the respiratory system. Such dose is almost entirely made of UFPs. According to the greater dose estimated, right lung lobes are expected to be more susceptible to respiratory pathologies than left lobes.},

The differences between the oxidative and inflammatory states in non-exposed NHBE and COPD-DHBE cells indicated that diseased cells conserved their specific physiopathological characteristics. Increases in both oxidative damage and cytokine secretion were reported in repeatedly exposed NHBE cells and particularly in COPD-DHBE cells. Diseased cells repeatedly exposed had lower capacities to metabolize the organic chemicals-coated onto the air-pollution-derived PM4, such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), but showed higher sensibility to the formation of OH-B[a]P DNA adducts, because their diseased state possibly affected their defenses. Differential profiles of epigenetic hallmarks (i.e., global DNA hypomethylation, P16 promoter hypermethylation, telomere length shortening, telomerase activation, and histone H3 modifications) occurred in repeatedly exposed NHBE and particularly in COPD-DHBE cells. Taken together, these results closely supported the highest responsiveness of COPD-DHBE cells to a repeated exposure to air pollution-derived PM4. The use of these innovative in vitro exposure systems such as NHBE and COPD-DHBE cells could therefore be consider as a very useful and powerful promising tool in the field of the respiratory toxicology, taking into account sensitive individuals.},

abstract = {Background
Air pollution episodes are associated with increased cardiopulmonary hospital admissions. Cohort studies showed associations of spatial variation in traffic-related air pollution with respiratory and cardiovascular mortality. Much less is known in particular about associations with cardiovascular morbidity. We explored the relation between spatial variation in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations and cardiopulmonary hospital admissions.
Methods
This ecological study was based on hospital admissions data (2001–2004) from the National Medical Registration and general population data for the West of the Netherlands (population 4.04 million). At the 4-digit postcode area level (n=683) associations between modeled annual average outdoor NO2 concentrations and hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular causes were evaluated by linear regression with the log of the postcode-specific percentage of subjects that have been admitted at least once during the study period as the dependent variable. All analyses were adjusted for differences in composition of the population of the postcode areas (age, sex, income).
Results
At the postcode level, positive associations were found between outdoor NO2 concentrations and hospital admission rates for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), all cardiovascular causes, ischemic heart disease and stroke (e.g. adjusted relative risk (95% confidence interval) for the second to fourth quartile relative to the first quartile of exposure were 1.87 (1.46–2.40), 2.34 (1.83–3.01) and 2.81 (2.16–3.65) for asthma; 1.44 (1.19–1.74), 1.50 (1.24–1.82) and 1.60 (1.31–1.96) for COPD). Associations remained after additional (indirect) adjustment for smoking (COPD admission rate) and degree of urbanization.
Conclusions
Our study suggests an increased risk of hospitalization for respiratory and cardiovascular causes in areas with higher levels of NO2. Our findings add to the currently limited evidence of a long-term effect of air pollution on hospitalization. The ecological design of our study is a limitation and more studies with individual data are needed to confirm our findings.},

BALB/c mice male (n = 32) and female (n = 82) in proestrus, estrus and diestrus were divided into two groups: 1) exposed to ambient air; 2) concentrated ambient particles (CAPs) to achieve an accumulated dose (concentration vs. time product) of 600 $\mu$g/m3, the time of the exposure was controlled to ensure the same concentration for all groups (5 days per week for 40–51 days). RT-PCR (Er$\beta$-1, Er$\beta$-2, Ahr, Cyp1a1, Cyp1a2, Cyp1b1), immunohistochemistry and morphometry (ER$\beta$, AhR) were used to analyze. The mucus profiles were examined using acid (Alcian Blue) and neutral (periodic acid Schiff's) stains. Exposed females had significantly lower levels of Er$\beta$-2 mRNA than exposed males (p = 0.036). Cyp1b1 mRNA in diestrus females was significantly lower in the CAP-exposed group compared with the ambient air group (p ≤ 0.05). ER$\beta$ expression in the epithelium and submucosa nucleus was lower in estrus exposed to CAPs compared with ambient air. CAPs increases AhR in the epithelium (p = 0.044) and submucosa (p = 0.001) nucleus of female when compared with male mice. Exposure to CAPs, also led to relatively increased acidic content in the mucus of males (p = 0.048), but decreased acidic content in that of females (p = 0.04). This study revealed sex-dependent responses to air pollution in the nasal epithelium that may partially explain the predisposition of females to airway respiratory diseases.},

abstract = {An enhanced research paradigm is presented to address the spatial and temporal gaps in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) measurements and generate realistic and representative concentration fields for use in epidemiological studies of human exposure to ambient air particulate concentrations. The general approach for research designed to analyze health impacts of exposure to PM2.5 is to use concentration data from the nearest ground-based air quality monitor(s), which typically have missing data on the temporal and spatial scales due to filter sampling schedules and monitor placement, respectively. To circumvent these data gaps, this research project uses a Hierarchical Bayesian Model (HBM) to generate estimates of PM2.5 in areas with and without air quality monitors by combining PM2.5 concentrations measured by monitors, PM2.5 concentration estimates derived from satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, and Community-Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model predictions of PM2.5 concentrations. This methodology represents a substantial step forward in the approach for developing representative PM2.5 concentration datasets to correlate with inpatient hospitalizations and emergency room visits data for asthma and inpatient hospitalizations for myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF) using case-crossover analysis. There were two key objective of this current study. First was to show that the inputs to the HBM could be expanded to include AOD data in addition to data from PM2.5 monitors and predictions from CMAQ. The second objective was to determine if inclusion of AOD surfaces in HBM model algorithms results in PM2.5 air pollutant concentration surfaces which more accurately predict hospital admittance and emergency room visits for MI, asthma, and HF. This study focuses on the New York City, NY metropolitan and surrounding areas during the 2004–2006 time period, in order to compare the health outcome impacts with those from previous studies and focus on any benefits derived from the changes in the HBM model surfaces. Consistent with previous studies, the results show high PM2.5 exposure is associated with increased risk of asthma, myocardial infarction and heart failure. The estimates derived from concentration surfaces that incorporate AOD had a similar model fit and estimate of risk as compared to those derived from combining monitor and CMAQ data alone. Thus, this study demonstrates that estimates of PM2.5 concentrations from satellite data can be used to supplement PM2.5 monitor data in the estimates of risk associated with three common health outcomes. Results from this study were inconclusive regarding the potential benefits derived from adding AOD data to the HBM, as the addition of the satellite data did not significantly increase model performance. However, this study was limited to one metropolitan area over a short two-year time period. The use of next-generation, high temporal and spatial resolution satellite AOD data from geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites is expected to improve predictions in epidemiological studies in areas with fewer pollutant monitors or over wider geographic areas.},

abstract = {Background
Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution has been associated with increased airway inflammation, but the roles of various PM2.5 constituents remain to be determined.
Objectives
To investigate the acute effects of PM2.5 constituents on fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), a well-established biomarker of respiratory inflammation.
Methods
A longitudinal panel study was performed among 32 healthy young adults in Shanghai, China from January 12th to February 6th, 2015. FeNO was repeatedly measured, 6–8 times per subject. Real-time mass concentration of ambient PM2.5 and chemical constituents were obtained from a nearby monitoring station. Linear mixed-effect models were applied to evaluate the association between FeNO and PM2.5 constituents, with the adjustment of age, gender, body mass index, temperature, relative humidity and day of week. The robustness of constituents' effects was also evaluated.
Results
A total of 234 effective measurements of FeNO were obtained with a geometric mean of 13.1 ppb. The PM2.5-FeNO associations were strongest at lags of 0–6h and diminished at lags longer than 12h. An interquartile range increase in PM2.5 constituents (NH4+, NO3−, K+, SO42− and elemental carbon) at lags of 0–6h were significantly associated with increments in FeNO by 12.3%, 11.3%, 11.1%, 9.6% and 10.7%, respectively. After controlling for PM2.5 total mass and the colinearity, only elemental carbon remained significant.
Conclusion
Several chemical constituents of PM2.5 may impact FeNO following acute exposure. Elemental carbon in particular may be the primary component responsible for increased airway inflammation.},

abstract = {Epidemiological studies have reported inconsistent and inconclusive associations between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and lung function in children from Europe and America, where air pollution levels were typically low. The aim of the present study is to examine the relationship between air pollutants and lung function in children selected from heavily industrialized and polluted cities in northeastern China. During 2012, 6740 boys and girls aged 7–14 years were recruited in 24 districts of seven northeastern cities. Portable electronic spirometers were used to measure lung function. Four-year average concentrations of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) were measured at monitoring stations in the 24 districts. Two-staged regression models were used in the data analysis, controlling for covariates. Overall, for all subjects, the increased odds of lung function impairment associated with exposure to air pollutants, ranged from 5% (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01, 1.10) for FVC < 85% predicted per 46.3 $\mu$g/m3 for O3 to 81% (aOR = 1.81; 95%CI = 1.44, 2.28) for FEV1 < 85% predicted per 30.6 $\mu$g/m3 for PM10. The linear regression models consistently showed a negative relationship between all air pollutants and lung function measures across subjects. There were significant interaction terms indicating gender differences for lung function impairment and pulmonary function from exposure to some pollutants (P < 0.10). In conclusion, long term exposure to high concentrations of ambient air pollution is associated with decreased pulmonary function and lung function impairment, and females appear to be more susceptible than males.},

abstract = {Exposure to particulate matter (PM) pollution in cities and urban canyons can be harmful to the exposed population. However, the underlying mechanisms that lead to health effects are not yet elucidated. It is postulated that exposure to repeated, small, environmentally relevant concentrations can affect lung homeostasis. This study examines the impact of repeated exposures to urban PM on mouse lungs with focus on inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters. Aqueous extracts from collected urban PM were administered to mice by 5 repeated intra-tracheal instillations (IT). Multiple exposures, led to an increase in cytokine levels in both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in the blood serum, indicating a systemic reaction. Lung mRNA levels of antioxidant/phase II detoxifying enzymes decreased by exposure to the PM extract, but not when metals were removed by chelation. Finally, disruption of lung tissue oxidant-inflammatory/defense balance was evidenced by increased levels of lipid and protein oxidation. Unlike response to a single IT exposure to the same dose and source of extract, multiple exposures result in lung oxidative damage and a systemic inflammatory reaction. These could be attributed to compromised capacity to activate the protective Nrf2 tissue defense system. It is suggested that water-soluble metals present in urban PM, potentially from break and tire wear, may constitute major drivers of the pulmonary and systemic responses to multiple exposure to urban PM.},

Median WTPs are estimated as 65, 51, and 83 PPP-adjusted 2012 USD for Afsin-Elbistan, Kutahya-Tavsanli and Ankara, respectively. Income elasticities of WTP are derived as 0.8 for Afsin-Elbistan and tested statistically indifferent from 1.0 for Kutahya-Tavsanli, and Ankara, and are found to be greater than the cases in existing studies conducted both in developed and developing countries. We also find that 60 to 90 percent of WTP are devoted for avoiding pain and discomfort/restricted activity days, and much less weights are given for avoiding possible financial losses. As for the determinants of WTP, university graduates, those who have experienced coughing within one month, have spent out-of-pocket medical expenses and actually lost some part of their income due the last experienced minor symptoms are willing to pay more to avoid the future acute respiratory illness while women and the household using coal as the main source of home-heating are willing to pay less in one or more study areas.

abstract = {Respiratory diseases, exacerbated through point source pollution, are currently among the leading causes of hospitalization of children in the United States. This paper investigates the relationship between the proximity of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) emitted from Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) facilities and the number of children diagnosed in hospitals with a respiratory disease in Tennessee. The importance of controlling for toxicity of those HAPs is of particular interest. Hospital discharge, socioeconomic, TRI emission, and HAP toxicity data are used to estimate, via Generalized Linear Methods, a logistic regression model describing the relationship between the percent of children living in a zip code area treated for respiratory illness and the average annual emissions over the previous 10 years of HAPs from TRI sites in that area. Controlling for area socioeconomic characteristics, we find that accounting for toxicity is important in uncovering the relationship between HAP emissions and respiratory health of children. A one standard deviation increase in toxicity-weighted emissions per 100 square miles is associated with an increase in the number of children diagnosed with asthma (chronic bronchitis) by about 1205 (260). The evidence suggests that, with a goal to improving children's respiratory health, monitoring the toxicity of chemicals being emitted is at least as important as simply monitoring total emission levels. This suggests that the EPA should consider making efforts toward establishing toxicity adjusted emission guidelines.},

Our aim was to quantitatively assess the short-term effects of ambient air pollution on pediatric outpatient visits for respiratory diseases. We conducted a time-series study in Yichang city, China between Jan 1, 2014 and Dec 31, 2015. Daily counts of pediatric respiratory outpatient visits were collected from 3 large hospitals, and then linked with air pollution data from 5 air quality monitoring stations by date. We used generalized additive Poisson models to conduct linear and nonlinear exposure-response analyses between air pollutant exposures and pediatric respiratory outpatient visits, adjusting for seasonality, day of week, public holiday, temperature, and relative humidity. Each interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM2.5 (lag 0), PM10 (lag 0), NO2 (lag 0), CO (lag 0), and O3 (lag 4) concentrations was significantly associated with a 1.91% (95% CI: 0.60%, 3.23%), 2.46% (1.09%, 3.85%), 1.88% (0.49%, 3.29%), 2.00% (0.43%, 3.59%), and 1.91% (0.45%, 3.39%) increase of pediatric respiratory outpatient visits, respectively. Similarly, the nonlinear exposure-response analyses showed monotonic increases of pediatric respiratory outpatient visits by increasing air pollutant exposures, though the associations for NO2 and CO attenuated at higher concentrations. These associations were unlikely modified by season. We did not observe significant association for SO2 exposure.

abstract = {Introduction
Particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone are recognized as the three pollutants that most significantly affect human health. Asthma is a multifactorial disease. However, the place of residence has rarely been investigated. We compared the impact of air pollution, measured near patients' homes, on emergency department (ED) visits for asthma or trauma (controls) within the Provence-Alpes-C{\^{o}}te-d'Azur region.
Methods
Variables were selected using classification and regression trees on asthmatic and control population, 3–99 years, visiting ED from January 1 to December 31, 2013. Then in a nested case control study, randomization was based on the day of ED visit and on defined age groups. Pollution, meteorological, pollens and viral data measured that day were linked to the patient's ZIP code.
Results
A total of 794,884 visits were reported including 6250 for asthma and 278,192 for trauma. Factors associated with an excess risk of emergency visit for asthma included short-term exposure to NO2, female gender, high viral load and a combination of low temperature and high humidity.
Conclusion
Short-term exposures to high NO2 concentrations, as assessed close to the homes of the patients, were significantly associated with asthma-related ED visits in children and adults.},

abstract = {Benzene exposure represents a potential risk for children's health. Apart from being a known carcinogen for humans (group 1 according to IARC), there is scientific evidence suggesting a relationship between benzene exposure and respiratory problems in children. But results are still inconclusive and inconsistent. This study aims to assess the determinants of exposure to indoor and outdoor residential benzene levels and its relationship with respiratory health in infants. Participants were 1-year-old infants (N = 352) from the INMA cohort from Valencia (Spain). Residential benzene exposure levels were measured inside and outside dwellings by means of passive samplers in a 15-day campaign. Persistent cough, low respiratory tract infections and wheezing during the first year of life, and covariates (dwelling traits, lifestyle factors and sociodemographic data) were obtained from parental questionnaires. Multiple Tobit regression and logistic regression models were performed to assess factors associated to residential exposure levels and health associations, respectively. Indoor levels were higher than outdoor ones (1.46 and 0.77 $\mu$g/m3, respectively; p < 0.01). A considerable percentage of dwellings, 42% and 21% indoors and outdoors respectively, surpassed the WHO guideline of 1.7 $\mu$g/m3 derived from a lifetime risk of leukemia above 1/100 000. Monitoring season, maternal country of birth and parental tobacco consumption were associated with residential benzene exposure (indoor and outdoors). Additionally, indoor levels were associated with mother's age and type of heating, and outdoor levels were linked with zone of residence and distance from industrial areas. After adjustment for confounding factors, no significant associations were found between residential benzene exposure levels and respiratory health in infants. Hence, our study did not support the hypothesis for the benzene exposure effect on respiratory health in children. Even so, it highlights a public health concern related to the personal exposure levels, since a considerable number of children surpassed the abovementioned WHO guideline for benzene exposure.},

abstract = {Background
In this study we sought to evaluate the association between viral bronchiolitis, weather conditions, and air pollution in an urban area in Italy.
Methods
We included infants hospitalized for acute bronchiolitis from 2004 to 2014. All infants underwent a nasal washing for virus detection. A regional agency network collected meteorological data (mean temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity) and the following air pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, benzene and suspended particulate matter measuring less than 10 µm (PM10) and less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) in aerodynamic diameter. We obtained mean weekly concentration data for the day of admission, from the urban background monitoring sites nearest to each child's home address. Overdispersed Poisson regression model was fitted and adjusted for seasonality of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, to evaluate the impact of individual characteristics and environmental factors on the probability of a being positive RSV.
Results
Of the 723 nasal washings from the infants enrolled, 266 (68%) contained RSV, 63 (16.1%) rhinovirus, 26 (6.6%) human bocavirus, 20 (5.1%) human metapneumovirus, and 16 (2.2%) other viruses. The number of RSV-positive infants correlated negatively with temperature (p < 0.001), and positively with relative humidity (p < 0.001). Air pollutant concentrations differed significantly during the peak RSV months and the other months. Benzene concentration was independently associated with RSV incidence (p = 0.0124).
Conclusions
Seasonal weather conditions and concentration of air pollutants seem to influence RSV-related bronchiolitis epidemics in an Italian urban area.},

A time-series model with quasi-Poisson link was used to examine the association between PM pollution and morbidities from respiratory diseases, COPD, asthma and pneumonia in Dongguan during 2013–2015. We further estimated the morbidity burden (population attributable fraction and attributable morbidity) due to ambient PM pollution. A total of 44,801 hospital outpatient visits for respiratory diseases were recorded during the study period. Both PM2.5 and PMc were found to be significantly associated with morbidity of overall respiratory diseases, COPD, and asthma. An IQR (interquartile range) increase in PM2.5 at lag03 day was associated with 15.41% (95% CI: 10.99%, 20.01%) increase in respiratory morbidity, and each IQR increase in PMc at lag03 corresponded to 7.24% (95% CI: 4.25%, 10.32%) increase in respiratory morbidity. We did not find significant effects of PM2.5 and PMc on pneumonia. Using WHO's guideline (25 $\mu$g/m3) as reference concentration, about 8.32% (95% CI: 5.90%, 10.86%) of respiratory morbidity (3727, 95% CI: 2642, 4867, in morbidity number) were estimated to be attributed to PM2.5, and 0.86% (95% CI: 0.50%, 1.23%) of respiratory morbidity, representing 385 (95% CI: 225, 551) hospital outpatient visits, could be attributed to coarse particulate pollutant. Our study suggests that both fine and coarse particulate pollutants are an important trigger of hospital outpatient visits for respiratory diseases, and account for substantial respiratory morbidity in Dongguan, China.},

Quantifying the detrimental effects on health and their costs derived from high PM2.5 levels is crucial because of the unsolved challenges to mitigate air pollution in the following decades. Using the daily monitoring data on PM2.5 concentrations and clinic visits, we found a non-linear increase of respiratory diseases, but not for other diseases (e.g., digestive diseases) under severe air pollution. We found an increase of respiratory diseases by 1% for each 10 $\mu$g m−3 increase in PM2.5 when the annual average daily PM2.5 concentration was less than 50 $\mu$g m−3; while this ratio was doubled (around 2%) with the daily PM2.5 concentration larger than 50 $\mu$g m−3. Under severe air pollution (PM2.5 concentration >150 $\mu$g m−3), the respiratory diseases increased by over 50% compared to that in clean days. Children are more sensitive to the severe air pollution. The increase of clinic visits, especially for adults, was observed mainly in bigger (>500 beds) hospitals. Re-allocating medical resources (e.g., doctors) from big hospitals to community hospitals can benefit the respiratory patients due to air pollution. The total medical cost of clinic visits of respiratory diseases derived from PM2.5 pollution was estimated at 17.2–57.0 billion Yuan in 2014 in China, accounting for 0.5–1.6% of national total health expenditure. Because these medical costs only represent a small part of total health cost derived from air pollution, the reduction of associated health costs would be an important co-benefit of implementation of air pollution preventive strategies.},

A generalized additive Poisson model was applied to explore the association between PM2.5 and health service use. The mean daily PM2.5 concentration was 99.5 $\mu$g/m3 with a range from 7.2 $\mu$g/m3 to 492.8 $\mu$g/m3. Ambient PM2.5 concentration was significantly associated with increased use of asthma-related health services. Every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration on the same day was significantly associated with a 0.67% (95% CI, 0.53%–0.81%), 0.65% (95% CI, 0.51%–0.80%), and 0.49% (95% CI, 0.35%–0.64%) increase in total hospital visits, outpatient visits and emergency room visits, respectively. The exposure–response association between PM2.5 concentration and hospital visits for asthma exacerbations was approximately linear. In conclusion, this study found that short-term elevations in PM2.5 concentration may increase the risk of asthma exacerbations.

abstract = {Background
The underlying mechanisms about the association between ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and lung function were unclear. Few epidemiological studies have evaluated the potential mediating effects of serum club cell secretory protein (Clara) (CC16), a biomarker of pulmonary epithelium integrity.
Objectives
To evaluate the short-term effect of personal PM2.5 exposure on lung function and to explore the potential mediating role of CC16 in this effect.
Methods
We enrolled 36 healthy, nonsmoking college students for a panel study in Shanghai, China from December 17, 2014 to July 11, 2015. We measured personal and real-time exposure to PM2.5 for 72 h preceding each of four rounds of health examinations, including lung function test and serum CC16 measurement. We used linear mixed-effect models to examine the effects of PM2.5 on lung function and CC16 over various lag times. Furthermore, we analyzed the mediating effect of CC16 in the association between PM2.5 and lung function.
Results
Average PM2.5 exposure ranged from 36 to 52 $\mu$g/m3 across different lag periods. PM2.5 exposure was negatively associated with lung function and positively associated with serum CC16 concentration. The effect of PM2.5 on CC16 occurred earlier than that on lung function. For instance, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in 0–2 h average exposure to PM2.5 was significantly associated with a 4.84% increase in serum CC16; and an IQR increase in 3–6 h average exposure to PM2.5 was significantly associated with a 1.08% decrease in 1-sec forced expiratory volume. These effects lasted up to 24 h after exposure. Increased serum CC16 contributed 3.9%–36.3% of the association between PM2.5 and impaired lung function.
Conclusions
Acute exposure to PM2.5 might induce an immediate decrease in lung function by virtue of the loss of pulmonary epithelium integrity.},

Data on hospital ERVs for RDs and ambient PM2.5 levels in 2012 were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research database and the Environmental Protection Administration, respectively. The lag structure of relative risks (RRs) of hospital ERVs for RDs was estimated using the Quasi-Poisson generalized additive model. During the study period, the average daily number of hospital ERVs for RDs, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), asthma, and pneumonia were 17, 15, 17, 17, and 17, respectively, and the mean 24-h average PM2.5 concentration was 27.8 $\mu$g/m3. Increased hospital ERVs for RDs were significantly associated with PM2.5; moreover, geographic variation in PM2.5 hospital ERVs for RDs was observed. In terms of RRs for each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5, Kao–Ping air quality zone (with districts: Kaohsiung and Pingdong) had the largest RRs associated with PM2.5; the RRs were 1.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05–1.45] for AECOPD (at lag 0–1 days), 1.07 (95% CI = 1.01–1.13) for asthma (at lag 0–1 days), and 1.07 (95% CI = 1.01–1.13) for pneumonia (at lag 0–1 days). On hot season, the RRs were 1.05 (95% CI = 1.01–1.08) for AECOPD (at lag 0–3 days); moreover, on cold season, the RRs were 1.15 (95% CI = 1.03–1.28) for asthma (at lag 0–1 days) and 1.15 (95% CI = 1.03–1.28) for pneumonia (at lag 0–1 days). Overall, PM2.5 exposure had lag effects on hospital ERVs for RDs; elevated RRs started at 2-day (lag 0–1 days), and larger RR estimates were observed at longer lags.

Estimates of noise exposure (Ldn, dB), and freeway and non-freeway emission concentrations of oxides of nitrogen (NOx, ppb) were spatially assigned to children in Southern California who were tested for forced vital capacity (FVC, n=1345), forced expiratory volume in 1s, (FEV1, n=1332), and asthma. The associations between traffic-related NOx and these outcomes, with and without adjustment for noise, were examined using mixed effects models. Adjustment for noise strengthened the association between NOx and reduced lung function. A 14.5mL (95% CI −40.0, 11.0mL) decrease in FVC per interquartile range (13.6 ppb) in freeway NOx was strengthened to a 34.6mL decrease after including a non-linear function of noise (95% CI −66.3, −2.78mL). Similarly, a 6.54mL decrease in FEV1 (95% CI −28.3, 15.3mL) was strengthened to a 21.1mL decrease (95% CI −47.6, 5.51) per interquartile range in freeway NOx. Our results indicate that where possible, noise should be included in epidemiological studies of the association between traffic-related air pollution on lung function. Without taking noise into account, the detrimental effects of traffic-related pollution may be underestimated.},

abstract = {Introduction and aims
The association between particulate matter < 10µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and mild disease episodes, not leading to hospitalization or death, has been rarely investigated. We studied the short-term effect of PM10 on purchases of specific cardiorespiratory medications, as proxies of mild episodes, in 7 small- and medium-sized cities of Northern Italy, during 2005–2006.
Materials and methods
We extracted information on purchased prescriptions from healthcare administrative databases, and we obtained daily PM10 concentrations from fixed monitoring stations. We applied a time-stratified case-crossover design, using the time-series of antidiabetic drugs purchases to control for confounding due to irregularities in daily purchase frequencies.
Results
During the warm season, we estimated a delayed (lags 2–6) increased risk of buying glucocorticoid (4.53%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.62, 6.48) and adrenergic inhalants (1.66%, 95% CI: 0.10, 3.24), following an increment (10$\mu$g/m3) in PM10 concentration. During the cold season, we observed an immediate (lags 0–1) increased risk of purchasing antiarrhythmics (0.76%; 95% CI: 0.16, 1.36) and vasodilators (0.72%; 95% CI: 0.30, 1.13), followed by a risk reduction (lags 2–6), probably due to harvesting.
Conclusions
Focusing on drug purchases, we reached sufficient statistical power to study PM10 effect outside large urban areas and conclude that short-term increments in PM10 concentrations might cause mild cardiorespiratory disease episodes.},

abstract = {Background
Both air pollution and weather impact hospitalization for respiratory diseases. However, few studies have investigated the contribution of weather to hospitalization related to the adverse effects of air pollution. This study analyzed the effects of particulate matter (PM) on daily respiratory-related hospital admissions, taking into account meteorological factors.
Methods
Daily hospital admissions for respiratory diseases (acute bronchitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma) between 2007 and 2010 were extracted from the National Health Insurance Corporation, Korea. Patients were divided into three age-based groups (0–15, 16–64, and ≥65 years). PM levels were obtained from 19 monitoring stations in Busan.
Results
The mean number of patients admitted for acute bronchitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma was 5.8 ± 11.9, 4.4 ± 6.1, and 3.3 ± 3.3, respectively. During that time, the daily mean PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were 49.6 ± 20.5 and 24.2 ± 10.9 $\mu$g/m3, respectively. The mean temperature anomaly was 7.0 ± 2.3 °C; the relative humidity was 62.0 ± 18.0%. Hospital admission rates for respiratory diseases increased with increasing PM and temperature, and with decreasing relative humidity. A multivariate analysis including PM, temperature anomaly, relative humidity, and age showed a significant increase in respiratory-related admissions with increasing PM levels and a decreasing relative humidity. Higher PM2.5 levels had a greater effect on respiratory-related hospital admission than did PM10 levels. Children and the elderly were the most susceptible to hospital admission for respiratory disease.
Conclusions
PM levels and meteorological factors impacted hospitalization for respiratory diseases, especially in children and the elderly. The effect of PM on respiratory diseases increased as the relative humidity decreased.},

Few studies have quantified the dynamics of air pollution and its impact on the risk of respiratory infection. We conducted an integrated data analysis to quantify the association among air quality index (AQI), meteorological variables and respiratory infection risk in Shaanxi province of China in the period of November 15th, 2010 to November 14th, 2016. Our analysis illustrated a statistically significantly positive correlation between the number of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases and AQI, and the respiratory infection risk has increased progressively with increased AQI with a time lag of 0–3 days. We also developed mathematical models for the AQI trend and respiratory infection dynamics, incorporating AQI-dependent incidence and AQI-based behaviour change interventions. Our combined data and modelling analysis estimated the basic reproduction number for the respiratory infection during the studying period to be 2.4076, higher than the basic reproduction number of the 2009 pandemic influenza in the same province. Our modelling-based simulations concluded that, in terms of respiratory infection risk reduction, the persistent control of emission in the China's blue-sky programme is much more effective than substantial social-economic interventions implemented only during the smog days.},

abstract = {Few studies have investigated the respiratory morbidity burden due to ambient air pollution in China, especially in a multi-city setting. This study aimed to estimate the short-term effects of ambient air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and SO2) on hospital admissions (HAs) for overall and cause-specific respiratory diseases, as well as the associated burden in 17 cities of Sichuan Basin, China during 2015–2016. Firstly, city-specific effect estimates for each pollutant on respiratory HAs were obtained using generalized additive model with quasi-Poisson link, and then random- or fixed-effects meta-analysis was applied to pool the effect estimates at the regional level. Subgroup analyses by sex, age, season and region were also performed. A total of 757,712 respiratory HAs were collected from all the tertiary and secondary hospitals located in the 17 cities. Risks of HAs for overall and cause-specific respiratory diseases were elevated following increased PM10, PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 exposure. An increase of 10 $\mu$g/m3 in PM10 at lag01, PM2.5 at lag01, NO2 at lag0 and SO2 at lag02 was associated with a 0.43% (95% CI: 0.33%, 0.53%), 0.53% (95% CI: 0.39%, 0.68%), 2.36% (95% CI: 1.75%, 2.98%) and 2.54% (95% CI: 1.51%, 3.59%) increases in total respiratory HAs, respectively. Children (≤ 14 years) and elderly (≥ 65 years) appeared to be more vulnerable to the effects of ambient air pollutants. Comparing to the WHO's air quality guidelines, we estimated that 1.84% (95%CI: 1.42%, 2.25%), 1.73% (95%CI: 1.27%, 2.19%) and 0.34% (95%CI: 0.21%, 0.48%) of respiratory HAs were due to PM10, PM2.5 and SO2 exposure, respectively. This study suggests that air pollution might be an important trigger of respiratory admissions, and result in substantial burden of HAs for respiratory diseases in Sichuan Basin.},

abstract = {Background
Given the lack of research on the personal exposure to fine particles (PM2.5) in Hong Kong, we examined the association between short-term personal exposure to PM2.5 and their constituents and inflammation in exhaled breath in a sample of healthy adult residents.
Method
Forty-six participants underwent personal PM2.5 monitoring for averagely 6 days to obtain 276 samples. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), a biomarker of inflammation in exhaled breath, was measured at the end of each 24-h personal monitoring. PM2.5 chemical constituents, including organic carbon, elemental carbon, 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and 6 phthalate esters, were speciated from the personal samples collected. A mixed-effects model was used to estimate the association of PM2.5 and their constituents with FeNO. The comparison was also made with parallel analyses using ambient concentrations.
Results
Personal exposures to PM2.5 (28.1 ± 23.3 $\mu$g/m3) were higher than the ambient levels (13.3 ± 6.4 $\mu$g/m3) monitored by stations. The composition profile and personal-to-ambient concentration ratio varied among subjects with different occupations. An interquartile range (IQR) change in personal exposure to PM2.5 was positively associated with 12.8% increase in FeNO (95% confidence interval, CI: 5.5–20.7%), while nil association was found for ambient PM2.5. Among the constituents measured, only the carcinogenic PAHs were significantly associated with 12% increase in FeNO responses (95% CI, 0.0–25.6%).
Conclusion
In conclusion, our study provides the first understanding about personal exposure to PM2.5 and possible sources in Hong Kong. The results also showed that personal exposure to PM2.5 and c-PAHs were linked to increased FeNO levels among healthy adults.},

@article{Carrillo2018,
abstract = {Background
Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children and has been linked to high levels of ambient air pollution and certain hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). Outdoor pollutants such as benzene, released by car emissions, and organic chemicals found in diesel exhaust, as well as particles and irritant gases, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3), contribute to an increased prevalence of respiratory diseases such as asthma.
Objectives
The objectives of this study were to: 1) conduct a screening survey to identify high risk for asthma among school-age children in Hidalgo County, and, 2) study the potential health impact of school-related exposure to HAPs pertaining to asthma risk.
Methods
We carried out a quantitative cross-sectional study combining a school-based asthma screening survey across 198 schools in Hidalgo County, Texas, with information on school neighborhood environments, including census tract-level information on hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and socioeconomic status (SES) in the respective school neighborhoods. HAPs levels were assessed based on the EPA 2011 National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) while SES information was assessed using data from the 2010–2014 American Community Survey.
Results
2930 students completed the asthma screening survey and results showed an overall asthma prevalence of 9.4%, slightly higher than the national and state prevalence. Participants in the 14–18 years old age group showed a much higher asthma prevalence of 16.7%. When assessing school-neighborhood characteristics, our results revealed no significant differences in asthma prevalence across census tracts with different SES levels. For HAPs, in the single-pollutant model, chlorine levels showed a significant linear trend for prevalence of asthma (p=0.03) while hydrochloric acid had a marginally significant linear trend (p=0.08). The association with chlorine remained significant in the multi-pollutant model.
Conclusions
Asthma prevalence among school-age children in Hidalgo County, Texas, is 9.4%, which is slightly higher than the state rate, especially among young adults, ages 14–18 years who had an asthma rate of 16.7%. Results support an association between exposures to school-neighborhood HAPs and risk for pediatric asthma, especially as related to chlorine. No significant effects of school-level SES on asthma risk were observed.},

abstract = {Air pollution in China has been very serious during the recent decades. However, few studies have investigated the effects of short-term exposure to PM2.5 and O3 on daily outpatient visits for respiratory diseases. We examined the effects of PM2.5 and O3 on the daily outpatient visits for respiratory diseases, explored the sensitivities of different population subgroups and analyzed the relative risk (RR) of PM2.5 and O3 in different seasons in Shanghai during 2013–2016. The generalized linear model (GLM) was applied to analyze the exposure-response relationship between air pollutants (daily average PM2.5 and daily maximum 8-h average O3), and daily outpatient visits due to respiratory diseases. The sensitivities of males and females at the ages of 15–60 yr-old and 60+ yr-old to the pollutants were also studied for the whole year and for the cold and warm months, respectively. Finally, the results of the single-day lagged model were compared with that of the moving average lag model. At lag 0 day, the RR of respiratory outpatients increased by 0.37% with a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5. Exposure to PM2.5 (RR, 1.0047, 95% CI, 1.0032–1.0062) was more sensitive for females than for males (RR, 1.0025, 95% CI, 1.0008–1.0041), and was more sensitive for the 15-60 yr-old (RR, 1.0041, 95% CI, 1.0027–1.0055) than the 60+ yr-old age group (RR, 1.0031, 95% CI, 1.0014–1.0049). O3 was not significantly associated with respiratory outpatient visits during the warm periods, but was negatively associated during the cold periods. PM2.5 was more significantly in the cold periods than that in the warm periods. The results indicated that control of PM2.5, compared to O3, in the cold periods would be more beneficial to the respiratory health in Shanghai. In addition, the single-day lagged model underestimated the relationship between PM2.5 and O3 and outpatient visits for respiratory diseases compared to the moving average lag model.},

abstract = {Objectives
Air pollution is an important public health concern especially for children who are particularly susceptible. Latin America has a large children population, is highly urbanized and levels of pollution are substantially high, making the potential health impact of air pollution quite large. We evaluated the effect of air pollution on children respiratory mortality in four large urban centers: Mexico City, Santiago, Chile, and Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.
Methods
Generalized Additive Models in Poisson regression was used to fit daily time-series of mortality due to respiratory diseases in infants and children, and levels of PM10 and O3. Single lag and constrained polynomial distributed lag models were explored. Analyses were carried out per cause for each age group and each city. Fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis was conducted in order to combine the city-specific results in a single summary estimate.
Results
These cities host nearly 43 million people and pollution levels were above the WHO guidelines. For PM10 the percentage increase in risk of death due to respiratory diseases in infants in a fixed effect model was 0.47% (0.09–0.85). For respiratory deaths in children 1–5 years old, the increase in risk was 0.58% (0.08–1.08) while a higher effect was observed for lower respiratory infections (LRI) in children 1–14 years old [1.38% (0.91–1.85)]. For O3, the only summarized estimate statistically significant was for LRI in infants. Analysis by season showed effects of O3 in the warm season for respiratory diseases in infants, while negative effects were observed for respiratory and LRI deaths in children.
Discussion
We provided comparable mortality impact estimates of air pollutants across these cities and age groups. This information is important because many public policies aimed at preventing the adverse effects of pollution on health consider children as the population group that deserves the highest protection.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to air pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM), represents a growing health problem. The aim of our study was to investigate whether PM could induce a dysbiosis in the nasal microbiota in terms of $\alpha$-diversity and taxonomic composition.
Methods
We investigated structure and characteristics of the microbiota of 40 healthy subjects through metabarcoding analysis of the V3–V4 regions of the 16s rRNA gene. Exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 was assessed with a personal sampler worn for 24h before sample collection (Day −1) and with measurements from monitoring stations (from Day −2 to Day −7).
Results
We found an inverse association between PM10 and PM2.5 levels of the 3rd day preceding sampling (Day −3) and $\alpha$-diversity indices (Chao1, Shannon and PD_whole_tree). Day −3 PM was inversely associated also with the majority of analyzed taxa, except for Moraxella, which showed a positive association. In addition, subjects showed different structural profiles identifying two groups: one characterized by an even community and another widely dominated by the Moraxella genus.
Conclusions
Our findings support the role of PM exposure in influencing microbiota and altering the normal homeostasis within the bacterial community. Whether these alterations could have a role in disease development and/or exacerbation needs further research.},

abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that ambient air pollution is a major risk factor for both acute and chronic respiratory disease exacerbations and emergencies. The objective of this study was to determine the association between ambient air pollutants and emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory conditions in nine districts across the province of Ontario in Canada. Health, air pollutant (PM2.5, NO2, O3, and SO2), and meteorological data were retrieved from April 2004 to December 2011. Respiratory diseases were categorized as: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, including bronchiectasis) and acute upper respiratory diseases. A case-crossover design was used to test the associations between ED visits and ambient air pollutants, stratified by sex and season. For COPD among males, positive results were observed for NO2 with lags of 3–6 days, for PM2.5 with lags 1–8, and for SO2 with lags of 4–8 days. For COPD among females, positive results were observed for O3 with lags 2–4 days, and for SO2 among lags of 3–6 days. For upper respiratory disease emergencies among males, positive results were observed for NO2 (lags 5–8 days), for O3, (lags 0–6 days), PM2.5 (all lags), and SO2 (lag 8), and among females, positive results were observed for NO2 for lag 8 days, for O3, PM2.5 among all lags. Our study provides evidence of the associations between short-term exposure to air pollution and increased risk of ED visits for upper and lower respiratory diseases in an environment where air pollutant concentrations are relatively low.},

To achieve this goal, 30 young, healthy adult participants were assigned to three groups with 4 samplers in each group to collect individual exposures during four weekends in March 2016. Participants also completed cardiopulmonary function tests during the same periods. For comparison, ambient air pollution data were obtained from the Air Pollution Surveillance Network in Guangzhou, China. The 8-h ambient pollutant averages and group sampler concentrations were used as separate indicators of air pollution exposure. Results showed that the 8-h mean concentration of personal PM2.5 exposure was 65.09 ± 22.18 $\mu$g/m3, which was 24.34 $\mu$g/m3 statistically higher than the ambient concentrations over the same period (p < 0.05). However, these concentrations were strongly correlated (Spearman's r = 0.937, p < 0.01). Separate mixed-effect models were fit for ambient and personal exposures to estimate their associations with cardiopulmonary outcomes. Higher PM2.5 and PM10 exposures were related to lower lung function of maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMEF). A 10 $\mu$g/m3 higher PM was associated with 0.11 L/S to 0.52 L/S lower MMEF. No effects on cardiovascular function were found. In conclusion, personal PM2.5 exposure might be higher than ambient concentrations. Young, healthy adults in urban areas may experience reduced lung function (lower MMEF), even after just 8 h of exposure to PM2.5 and PM10.},

abstract = {Understanding the impact on human health during peak episodes in air pollution is invaluable for policymakers. Particles less than PM2.5 can penetrate the respiratory system, causing cardiopulmonary and other systemic diseases. Statistical regression models are usually used to assess air pollution impacts on human health. However, when there are databases missing, linear statistical regression may not process well and alternative data processing should be considered. Nonlinear Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are not employed to research environmental health pollution even though another advantage in using ANN is that the output data can be expressed as the number of hospital admissions. This research applied ANN to assess the impact of air pollution on human health. Three well-known ANN were tested: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) and Echo State Networks (ESN), to assess the influence of PM2.5, temperature, and relative humidity on hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases. Daily PM2.5 levels were monitored, and hospital admissions for respiratory illness were obtained, from the Brazilian hospital information system for all ages during two sampling campaigns (2008–2011 and 2014–2015) in Curitiba, Brazil. During these periods, the daily number of hospital admissions ranged from 2 to 55, PM2.5 concentrations varied from 0.98 to 54.2 $\mu$g m−3, temperature ranged from 8 to 26 °C, and relative humidity ranged from 45 to 100%. Of the ANN used in this study, MLP gave the best results showing a significant influence of PM2.5, temperature and humidity on hospital attendance after one day of exposure. The Anova Friedman's test showed statistical difference between the appliance of each ANN model (p < .001) for 1 lag day between PM2.5 exposure and hospital admission. ANN could be a more sensitive method than statistical regression models for assessing the effects of air pollution on respiratory health, and especially useful when there is limited data available.},

The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between sources of household air pollution, respiratory symptoms and lung function.
Methods
3039 adults aged from 40 to 65 participated in the 2011–2013 ELISABET cross-sectional survey in northern France. Lung function was measured using spirometry. During a structured interview, respiratory symptoms, household fuels, exposure to moulds, and use of ventilation were recorded on a questionnaire.
Results
The self-reported presence of mould in at least two rooms (not including the bathroom and the kitchen) was associated with a 2.5% lower predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (95% confidence interval, −4.7 to −0.29; p-trend <0.05) and a higher risk of wheezing (p-trend < 0.001). Visible condensation was associated with wheezing (p < .05) and chronic cough (p < .05). There were no significant associations with the type of household fuel or inadequate ventilation/aeration. Similar results were found when the analyses were restricted to participants without known respiratory disease.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that the presence of mould (known to be associated with more severe asthma symptoms) could also have an impact on respiratory symptoms and lung function in the general population and in populations without known respiratory disease.},

abstract = {Background
Pneumonia is a common early-childhood respiratory infection that leads to long-term health impacts, but its risk factors remain unclear.
Objective
To examine the association between early life exposure to both outdoor and indoor air pollution and childhood pneumonia.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 2598 children aged 3–6 years in Changsha, China (2011-2012). Children's life-time prevalence of pneumonia and exposure to indoor air pollution related to home renovation were surveyed by a questionnaire answered by the parents. Children's exposure to outdoor air pollution, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 $\mu$m (PM10), was estimated using the measured concentrations at monitoring stations. Association between childhood pneumonia and exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution during both prenatal and postnatal periods were examined by using logistic regression model in terms of odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
Results
Life-time prevalence of pneumonia in preschool children in Changsha is high, up to 38.6%.We found that childhood pneumonia was associated with postnatal exposure to outdoor particulate air pollutant PM10, adjusted OR (95% CI) = 1.26 (1.00–1.57) for per 6 $\mu$g/m3 increase in the concentration. Pneumonia was also associated with postnatal exposure to indoor renovation, adjusted OR (95% CI) = 1.30 (1.02–1.64) for new furniture and 1.30 (1.00–1.69) for redecoration. Combined exposure to outdoor high PM10 and indoor renovation significantly increased the pneumonia risk. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the association was heterogeneous in different subgroups, but stronger in male and younger children.
Conclusion
High prevalence of childhood pneumonia in China may be associated with postnatal exposure to ambient particulate air pollution and house renovation.},

abstract = {Objective
Ambient ozone is one of the most important air pollutants with respect to its impacts on human health and its increasing concentrations globally. However, studies which explored the burden of ozone pollution on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and estimated the relevant economic loss were rare.
Objective
We explored the relationships between ambient ozone exposure and years of life lost (YLL) from COPD mortality and estimated the relevant economic loss in Ningbo, in the Yangtze River Delta of China, 2011–2015.
Methods
A time-series study was conducted to explore the effects of ozone on YLL from COPD. Seasonal stratified analyses were performed, and the effect modification of demographic factors was estimated. In addition, the related economic loss was calculated using the method of the value per statistical life year (VSLY).
Results
Averaged daily mean maximum 8-h average ozone concentration was 40.90 ppb in Ningbo, China, 2011–2015. The effect of short term ambient ozone exposure on COPD YLL was more pronounced in the cool season than in the warm season, with 10 ppb increment of ozone corresponding to 7.09(95%CI: 3.41, 10.78) years increase in the cool season and 0.31 (95%CI: −2.15, 2.77) years change in the warm season. The effect was higher in the elderly than the young. Economic loss due to excess COPD YLL related to ozone exposure accounted for 7.30% of the total economic loss due to COPD YLL in Ningbo during the study period.

Beijing, the capital of China, is one of the most severely haze-polluted metropolis in the world; the entire city faces air pollution-related heath risks on a frequent basis. The goal of this study is to evaluate the short-term effect of ambient air pollution on emergency room (ER) admissions for respiratory disesases in Beijing, China. We used a generalized additive model to study a total of 274,627 ER admission cases for respiratory diseases from 2009 to 2012. We analyzed the correlations between three major ambient air pollutants (including PM10, SO2, and NO2) and the ER admissions for different age and gender subgroups. The results showed that: a) the effects of PM10 and SO2 are stronger in males than in females and in the elders (age ≥ 65years) than younger people; b) the effect of NO2 is stronger in children (age ≤ 15years) than older people; c) for per 10$\mu$g/m3 increase in ambient PM10, SO2, and NO2 concentration, the greatest increase persentage (IP) of ER admissions was 2.8% (95% CI: 2.3–3.4%), 3.6% (95% CI: 1.4–5.8%), and 7.7% (95% CI:7.0–8.4%), respectively; d) increases in the three major ambient air pollutant concentrations affected ER admissions for respiratory diseases the most at lag 0–1 day. In particular, the elderly and females were relatively more sensitive to the three outdoor air pollutants, and were affected right away after the air pollutant concentration went up.},

BC and aged BC can cause respiratory system inflammation and induce lesions at relevant sites, but the underlying mechanism has remained unknown. To gain insight into the potential mechanisms, we focused on macrophages and transforming growth factor $\beta$-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) which are a crucial factor in inflammation. Our research aims to determine the role of TAK1 in macrophages in pulmonary inflammation induced by particulate matter. In this study, BC and 1,4-naphthoquinone were mixed to model aged BC (1,4NQ-BC) in atmosphere. BC induced mice lung inflammation model, lung macrophage knock-down TAK1 animal model and primary macrophage knock-down TAK1 model were used to explore whether TAK1 in macrophage is a critical role in the process of inflammation. The results showed that the expressions of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, IL-33) mRNA were significantly increased and the phosphorylation of MAPK and NF-$\kappa$B signaling pathway related proteins were enhanced in RAW 264.7 cell lines. In vivo studies revealed that the indicators of pulmonary inflammation (pathology, inflammatory cell numbers) and related cytokines (IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, IL-33) mRNA expressions in CD11c-Map3k7−/− animals were significantly lower than wild-type animals after mice were instilled particles. In mice primary macrophages, the expressions of IL-6, IL-33 mRNA were inhibited after TAK1 gene was knock-down. These results unequivocally demonstrated that TAK1 plays a crucial role in BC induced lung inflammation in mice, and we can infer that BC and 1,4NQ-BC cause these inflammatory responses by stimulating pulmonary macrophages.},

Average mass concentrations of PM2.5 (fine) and PM10-2.5 (coarse) varied from ∼40–160 and 30–67 $\mu$g m−3, respectively. PM mass size distribution analysis revealed multi-modal peaks in monsoon (tri-modal: < 0.5; 1.4–1.8; 7.8 $\mu$m), post monsoon (tetra-modal: < 0.5; 1.4–1.8; 3.2; 7.8 $\mu$m), winter (tri-modal: < 0.5; 1.4–1.8; 5.8 $\mu$m) and summer (tetra-modal: < 0.5; 1.4–1.8; 3.2; 7.8 $\mu$m). The MMAD ± GSD were found to be 2.1 $\mu$m ± 3.0 (monsoon), 1.0 ± 3.0 $\mu$m (post monsoon), 1.1 $\mu$m ± 2.7 (winter) and 2.4 $\mu$m ± 2.9 (summer).

Coarse particles exhibited higher mass deposition fraction (84%) in HEAD (extrathoracic), whereas fine particles deposited significantly (33%) in PUL (pulmonary region). Intensification of biomass and biofuel burning emissions during post-monsoon and wintertime have implications to deeper penetration and higher mass deposition fraction of fine-particles in the PUL region. High PM concentration and its significant deposition in PUL region calls for immediate measures to be taken to improve regional air quality to reduce health hazards and disease burden for exposed population.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to environmental air pollutants exacerbates respiratory illness, but prospective studies of disease incidence are uncommon. Further, attempts to estimate effects from multiple point sources have rarely been undertaken. The current study examined risk of incident chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma in association with emissions of multiple air pollutants from point pollution sources in Australia.
Methods
We analyzed prospective cohort data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health. Women from three age-cohorts (N = 35,755) were followed for up to 21 years for incident COPD and asthma. Exposures were measured from the National Pollutant Inventory and included carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). We identified inverse-distance weighted emissions in kilograms that women experienced over time from point sources within 10 km of their residences. Cox proportional hazards regression models examined risk of self-reported doctor-diagnosed COPD and asthma in association with pollutant exposures and covariates.
Results
New COPD cases numbered 3616 (11.5%) and new asthma cases numbered 2725 (9.4%). Participants were exposed to an average of 47–59 sites with air pollution emissions within 10 km of their residences. Fossil fuel electricity generation and mining made the largest contributions to air pollution but hundreds of other types of emissions also occurred. Controlling for covariates, all five air pollutants modeled individually were significantly associated with risk of COPD. Modeled jointly, only sulfur dioxide (SO2) remained significantly associated with COPD (HR = 1.038, 95% CI = 1.010–1.067), although the five pollutants were highly correlated (r = 0.89). None of the pollutants were significantly associated with adult onset asthma. Cohort-specific analyses indicated that COPD risk was significantly associated with SO2 exposure for younger (HR = 1.021, CI = 1.001–1.047), middle-age (HR = 1.019, CI = 1.004–1.034) and older cohorts (HR = 1.025, CI = 1.004–1.047).
Conclusions
Multiple exposure sources and pollutants contributed to COPD risk, including electricity generation and mining but extending to many industrial processes. The results highlight the importance of policy efforts and technological improvements to reduce harmful air pollution emissions across the industrial landscape.},

abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an essential risk factor of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Recent studies showed weak association between PM2.5 and COPD incidence, but smokers who exposed to higher PM2.5 concentration had more opportunity to gain COPD. Cigarette smoking is the most important risk factor of COPD. Thus, we hypothesized: the role of PM2.5 played on cigarette-inflamed airways was more significant than normal airways. The study firstly established an animal model of C57BL/6J mice with cigarette smoke exposure and PM2.5 orotracheal administration. After calculating pathological scores, mean linear intercept and mean alveolar area, we found PM2.5 aggravated pathological injury of cigarette-inflamed lungs, but the injury on normal lungs was not significant. Meanwhile, inflammatory factors as T-bet, IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-1$\alpha$ were tested using qRT-PCR and ELISA. The results showed PM2.5 aggravated inflammation of cigarette-inflamed lungs, but the effect on normal lungs was not significant. The most important pathogenesis of COPD is abnormal apoptosis in airway epithelium, due to oxidative stress following long-term exposure to cigarette smoke. Then, apoptotic responses were detected in lungs. TUNEL analysis demonstrated that PM2.5 promoted DNA fragmentation of cigarette-inflamed lungs, but the effect on normal lungs was not significant. Western-blot and immunohistochemistry showed caspase activated significantly in PM2.5-cigarette smoke exposed lungs and activated caspase 3 located mainly on bronchial epithelium. Next, human bronchial epithelial cells were cultured treated with cigarette smoke solution (CSS) with or without PM2.5. Z-VAD-FMK, a pan-caspase inhibitor, was used to suppress the activation of caspases. After analyzing cell viability, DNA fragmentation, mitochondrial activities and caspase activities, the results clarified that PM2.5 aggravated apoptosis in cigarette-inflamed bronchial epithelial cells and the responses could be suppressed by Z-VAD-FMK. Our results gave a new idea about the mechanism of PM2.5 on COPD and inferred cigarette-inflamed airways were more vulnerable to PM2.5 than normal airways.},

The impacts of air pollution on asthma attacks have become a hotspot. Previous studies mainly focused on the developed countries or cities. There have been very limited studies in less-developed region to quantify the effects of air pollutants on asthma admissions in children. This study aims to assess the short-term impact of air pollutants on asthma hospital admissions for children in Hefei, China.
Methods
Poisson generalized linear regression combined with distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) were applied to investigate the effects of air pollutants on daily childhood hospital admissions of asthma from 2015 to 2016, controlling for meteorological factors. Subgroup analyses by sex and age were performed.
Results
There were a total of 17,227 asthma admissions during 2015–2016. We found positive correlations between childhood asthma hospital visits and concentrations of NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5. Significantly, NO2 exhibited robust positive correlations with cumulative effects 1.551 (95% CI: 1.306–1.841, lag0–3 days) in single-pollutant model and 1.580 (95% CI: 1.315–1.899, lag0–3 days) in multiple-pollutant model.
Conclusions
Air pollutants had adverse effects on childhood asthma. NO2 presented the greatest effect, followed by PM2.5. Results will be important for health authority and guardians to realize the severity of air pollution on the increased risk of asthma, so as to develop relevant strategies and health interventions to meet the challenges of childhood asthma and reduce air pollution.},

abstract = {Background
Multiple lines of evidence have associated exposure to ambient air pollution with an increased risk of respiratory malignancies. However, there is a dearth of evidence from low-middle income countries, including those within South America, where the social inequalities are more marked.
Objectives
To quantify the association between exposures to traffic related air pollution and respiratory cancer incidence and mortality within S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil. Further, we aim to investigate the role of socioeconomic status (SES) upon these outcomes.
Methods
Cancer incidence between 2002 and 2011 was derived from the population-based cancer registry. Mortality data (between 2002 and 2013) was derived from the Municipal Health Department. A traffic density database and an annual nitrogen dioxide (NO2) land use regression model were used as markers of exposure. Age-adjusted Binomial Negative Regression models were developed, stratifying by SES and gender.
Results
We observed an increased rate of respiratory cancer incidence and mortality in association with increased traffic density and NO2 concentrations, which was higher among those regions with the lowest SES. For cancer mortality and traffic exposure, those in the most deprived region, had an incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 2.19 (95% CI: 1.70, 2.82) when comparing the highest exposure centile (top 90%) to the lowest (lowest 25%). By contrast, in the least deprived area, the IRR for the same exposure contrast was.1.07 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.20). For NO2 in the most deprived regions, the IRR for cancer mortality in the highest exposed group was 1.44 (95% CI: 1.10, 1.88) while in the least deprived area, the IRR for the highest exposed group was 1.11 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.23).
Conclusions
Traffic density and NO2 were associated with an increased rate of respiratory cancer incidence and mortality in S{\~{a}}o Paulo. Residents from poor regions may suffer more from the impact of traffic air pollution.},

To investigate the effects of short-term exposure to PM2.5 and ozone in high-level areas on respiratory deaths and non-accidental deaths.
Methods
Time-series analysis was used to investigate the association between PM2.5/O3 and non-accidental deaths and respiratory deaths at Hefei, China from 2013 to 2015.
Results
PM2.5 and O3 exposure were associated with elevated non-accidental and respiratory deaths. With every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5, the rate of respiratory deaths and non-accidental deaths increased by 1.24% (95%CI: 0.29%–2.20%) and 0.36% (95%CI: 0.10%–0.63%), respectively. In addition, every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in ozone also associated with 2.22% (95%CI: 0.56%–3.90%) and 0.05% (95%CI: 0.42%-0.53%) increase in respiratory deaths and non-accidental deaths, respectively. The analysis of multi-pollutant model showed that the inclusion of ozone further increased the effects of PM2.5 on respiratory deaths. The inclusion of PM2.5 decreased the effects of O3 on respiratory deaths. In addition, the effects of PM2.5/O3 on daily respiratory and non-accidental deaths were more evident in the cold season, females and elderlies (65 years or older).

In this study, fine dust collected from Beijing, China (CPM) (size < PM13 with majority < PM2.5) was evaluated for its oxidative stress- and inflammation-inducing effects, which cause cell damage, in A459 human lung epithelial cells. Oxidative stress was marked by an increase in intracellular ROS levels and the production of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Upon induction of oxidative stress, a marked increase was observed in the expression of key inflammatory mediators such as COX-2 and PGE2 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-6 via NF-kB and MAPK pathways. Cellular damage was marked by a reduction in viability, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, formation of apoptotic and necrotic bodies, accumulation of sub-G1 phase cells, and DNA damage. Apoptosis was found to be mediated via the activation of caspases through the mitochondria-mediated pathway. Fucosterol, purified from the brown alga Sargassum binderi (Sonder ex J. Agardh) by bio-assay-guided fractionation and purification, exhibited potential therapeutic effects against CPM-induced detrimental effects. Further studies could focus on developing fucosterol, in forms such as steroidal inhalers, against PM-induced pulmonary tissue inflammation.},

abstract = {Background
Ambient PM2.5 is considered harmful to the respiratory system. However, little has been shown about the long-term association between ambient PM2.5 and asthma.
Methods
A survey from 2007 to 2010 was conducted among adults over 50 years of age in six low- and middle- income countries (including China, India, Ghana, Mexico, Russia, and South Africa), which belonged to one part of a prospective cohort study - the Study on global AGEing and adult health. The yearly mean PM2.5 concentrations of the residential communities of participants were estimated from remote sensing data. A mixed effects model was applied to investigate the association between ambient PM2.5 and asthma.
Results
A total of 4553 asthma patients were identified among the 29,249 participants in this study, producing a prevalence of 15.57%. For each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5, the adjusted prevalence ratio of asthma was 1.05 (95% Confidence Interval: 1.01, 1.08) after controlling for the effects of sex, age, BMI, education attainment, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and occupational exposure. Further analyses showed that males and smokers might be particularly vulnerable populations. Additionally, it was estimated that about 5.12% of the asthma cases in the study population (95% Confidence Interval: 1.44%, 9.23%) could be attributed to long-term PM2.5 exposure.
Conclusion
Long-term exposure to PM2.5 might be an important risk factor of asthma. Effective air pollution reduction measures should be taken to reduce PM2.5 concentrations in order to reduce the associated asthma cases and disease burden.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between short-term exposure to ambient air pollution and respiratory disease over a long-term period in Shiraz, one of the largest cities in Iran. Methods: hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases (asthma, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pleural effusion) in residents of Shiraz between March 21, 2009 and March 20, 2015 were included. Demographics for each patient and meta data to include principal meteorological variables (temperature and relative humidity) and five ambient pollutants (CO, O3, SO2, NO2, and PM10) were also included. Statistical analysis was performed by Poisson regression in single-pollutant generalized linear model with principal component analysis (GLPCA) to analyze the relationship between pollutants and hospital admissions at the 0–9 cumulative lag day period. Pearson correlation test was used to determine the relationship between different pollutants, temperature and humidity.
Results
It was found that the highest increase in asthma admission was related to PM10 (relative risk (RR) = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.17, 1.47). For COPD, the rate of hospital visits significantly increased with the increase in NO2 concentration (RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.09.1.27). In the children's hospital, O3 (RR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.06, 1.47) and SO2 (RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.07, 1.28) affected the asthma admissions and all contaminants (highest RR observed was for NO2 (RR = 1.28 95% CI = 1.18, 1.40) affected pneumonia admissions on cumulative lag days of 0–9.

An increase of 10 $\mu$g/m3 in SO2, NO2, and PM10 was associated with 7.69% (95%CI: 3.41%–12.15%), 4.38% (95%CI: 1.33%–7.53%), and 1.55% (95%CI: 0.80%–2.30%) increase of respiratory diseases mortality, respectively. In contrast, lung cancer mortality was only significantly associated with SO2 level. Subgroup analyses showed that female in respiratory disease patients were more sensitive to air pollution than male. Studies about seasonality of pollutants on respiratory and lung cancer mortality were inconsistent. Further analyses with multiple-pollutant model showed that the effects of pollutants were generally decreased after the other pollutants were adjusted, except the effects of SO2 on lung cancer. These findings demonstrated that air pollution could evidently increase the respiratory disease and lung cancer mortality.},

abstract = {Verona is an Italian city which experiences low levels of air quality due to its location near the centre of the Po Valley, one of the most polluted areas in Italy and in Europe. High pollutant concentrations, in particular of fine aerosol particles, are associated with detrimental effects on human health. The present study analyses the ground-based measurements of particulate matter with a diameter ≤2.5$\mu$m (PM2.5) and ≤10$\mu$m (PM10) registered in Verona and its province since 2002 to 2015. The annual means and the number of days when the European standards were exceeded show that air quality has slightly improved in the analysed period, with statistically significant negative trends present in both PM10 and PM2.5 levels. The annual mortality due to different diseases attributable to PM2.5 has been estimated for the period 2009–2014 by employing concentration-response functions based on epidemiological cohort studies. Results show that, on average, about 299 deaths per year (3 are infants) are caused by PM2.5 related diseases in Verona province. Among these, about 88 deaths per year (1 is infant) occur in Verona municipality. This means that 11.3% of the total deaths due to diseases of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems is attributable to long-term exposure to PM2.5 pollution.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to ambient fine particles, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), is a public health concern. Concentrations of ambient PM2.5 have changed temporally in the past 10 years after a series of action policies for improving air quality were implemented in Taiwan. In this study, temporal changes in the relationship between PM2.5 and lung function among children were investigated.
Methods
A nationwide respiratory health survey was conducted among Taiwanese elementary and middle school students in 2011 and again in 2016–2017. A questionnaire was administered to students, for whom forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were measured using spirometry. During the study period, monthly concentrations of ambient PM2.5 were obtained from the monitoring stations of the Environmental Protection Administration. Lung function measurements were compared with ambient PM2.5 exposure using mixed-effects models.
Results
In the 2011 survey (mean PM2.5: 40.6 $\mu$g/m3), exposure to PM2.5 in the preceding 1–2 months was associated with a 2.2% decrease (95% confidence interval [CI]: −4.1%, −0.3%) in FVC and a 2.3% decrease (95% CI: −4.0%, −0.5%) in FEV1. By contrast, a significant relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and lung function was not observed in the 2016–2017 survey (mean PM2.5: 30.0 $\mu$g/m3).
Conclusions
As improvement in air quality over time, the negative relationship between PM2.5 and childhood lung function tend to be not significant.},

The objective of this work is to predict the deposition of particles from different sources in the human lung. The whole lung, consisting of 24 generations of branches from trachea to alveoli, was approximated using a one-dimensional lumped “trumpet” model with a variable cross-sectional area. The aerosol dynamics equation was numerically solved using a finite difference method to investigate the transport and deposition of particles in the lung model. Particles from various sources were assumed to be different in both size and density. We found that in general, coarse particles (> 2.5 µm) were mainly deposited in the tracheobronchial (TB) region by impaction, and fine particles (< 2.5 µm) were mainly deposited in the pulmonary (P) region by sedimentation and diffusion. However, the coarse particles with low density can be deposited in P region by sedimentation. As a comparison, our results found that soil particles, which are coarse with low density, were deposited in the deep lung more than traffic particles, which are fine with high density. Modeling of particle deposition in the human lung indicated that coarse particles generated by crustal sources may have adverse health effects as strong as those resulting from fine particles generated from combustion sources.},

abstract = {Numerous studies have explored the relationships between short-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and morbidity. However, few studies have investigated which PM2.5 sources and constituents contribute to the health associations, and even fewer studies are available which explored age or seasonal effect modification for the associations between PM2.5 sources and health. We explored age-specific associations between short-term exposure to PM2.5 chemical constituents and its sources, and hospital admissions in California. We linked hospital admission data (n = 1,679,094) with PM2.5 chemical constituents and source apportionment data for eight sites in California for the period of 2002–2009. Site-specific source apportionment was conducted using Positive Matrix Factorization, and five PM2.5 sources were commonly identified in most sites (biomass burning, soil, secondary ammonium nitrate, secondary ammonium sulfate, and vehicular emissions). Age-stratified Poisson time-series regression was conducted for each site, and the health risk estimates were combined to generate overall age-specific associations with cardiovascular- and respiratory-related hospital admissions. We further conducted seasonal interaction models to assess seasonal effect modification. An interquartile range increase in PM2.5 vehicular emissions was associated with increased risk of cardiovascular-related hospital admission at lag 0 (1.32% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16, 2.49]) for elderly people (≥65 years old). Exposure to PM2.5 vehicular emissions increased the risk of respiratory-related hospitalizations at lag 2 (3.58% [95% CI: 0.90, 6.33]) for children (0–18 years old). Risk estimates of PM2.5 total mass, vehicular emissions, and its related constituents (e.g., iron) for respiratory admissions were higher in the warm season among children. Heterogeneous seasonal estimates were not observed for other age groups. Our results suggest that short-term exposures to several PM2.5 sources and their related constituents are more harmful than exposures to other pollutants, particularly for children in summer. Identifying toxic sources is important for developing effective interventions and protecting susceptible populations.},

We examined the mass, chemical constituents, and sources of PM2.5 for short-term associations with the pulmonary function of adults with severe asthma in a low air pollution environment in urban Nagasaki, Japan. We recruited 35 asthmatic adults and obtained the daily record of morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) in spring 2014–2016. PM2.5 filters were extracted from an air quality monitoring station (178 days) and measured for 27 chemical elements. Source apportionment was performed using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF). We fitted generalized linear model with generalized estimating equation (GEE) method to estimate changes in PEF (from personal monthly maximum) and odds of severe respiratory deterioration (first ≥ 15% PEF reduction within a 1-week interval) associated with mass, constituents, and sources of PM2.5, with adjustment for temperature and relative humidity. Constituent sulfate (SO42−) and PM2.5 from oil combustion and traffic were associated with reduced PEF. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in SO42− (3.7 $\mu$g/m3, average lags 0–1) was associated with a decrease of 0.38% (95% confidence interval = −0.75% to −0.001%). An IQR increase in oil combustion and traffic-sourced PM2.5 (2.64 $\mu$g/m3, lag 1) was associated with a decrease of 0.33% (−0.62% to −0.002%). We found a larger PEF decrease associated with PM2.5 from dust/soil on Asian Dust days. There was no evidence linking total mass and metals to reduced pulmonary function. The ventilatory capacity of adults with severe asthma is susceptible to specific constituents/sources of PM2.5 such as sulfate and oil combustion and traffic despite active self-management of asthma and low air pollution levels in the study location.},

Traffic sources near the primary school were the main contributors to indoor and outdoor pollutants during both periods. Moreover, air quality in this primary school was affected by coal combustion and atmospheric reactions during the heating and nonheating periods, respectively. Based on the estimation by exposure-response functions and the weighting of indoor and outdoor pollutants during different periods, the levels of PM2.5, PM 10 and O3 at school had adverse respiratory health effects on children. Longer exposures during the nonheating period contributed to higher health risks. These results emphasized that emission sources nearby had a direct impact on air quality in school and children's respiratory health. Therefore, measures should be taken for double control on air pollution inside and outside the classroom to protect children from it.},

Investigation of the potential association of the spread of the COVID-19 infection with climate or ambient air pollution could lead to the development of preventive strategies for disease control. To examine this association, we conducted a longitudinal cohort study of 28 geographical areas of Japan with documented outbreaks of COVID-19. We analyzed data obtained from March 13 to April 6, 2020, before the Japanese government declared a state of emergency. The results revealed that the epidemic growth of COVID-19 was significantly associated with increase in daily temperature or sunshine hours. This suggests that an increase in person-to-person contact due to increased outing activities on a warm and/or sunny day might promote the transmission of COVID-19. Our results also suggested that short-term exposure to suspended particles might influence respiratory infections caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Further research by well-designed or well-controlled study models is required to ascertain this effect. Our findings suggest that weather has an indirect role in the transmission of COVID-19 and that daily adequate preventive behavior decreases the transmission.},

Results of mixed model linear multiple regression analyses indicated that, controlling for covariates, COVID-19 prevalence and fatality rates were significantly associated with greater DPM. Proximity to TSDFs was associated to greater fatality rates, and proximity to RMPs was associated with greater prevalence rates. Results are consistent with previous research indicating that air pollution increases susceptibility to respiratory viral pathogens. Results should be interpreted cautiously given the ecological design, the time lag between exposure and outcome, and the uncertainties in measuring COVID-19 prevalence. Areas with worse prior air quality, especially higher concentrations of diesel exhaust, may be at greater COVID-19 risk, although further studies are needed to confirm these relationships.},

No previous epidemiological study has investigated the combined association of long-term ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter of diameter size-2.5 (PM2.5) exposure with asthma outcomes among schoolchildren in Africa.
Objectives
This study investigated the independent and co-pollutant association of long-term exposures to ambient air pollutants on asthma-associated outcomes in a cohort of schoolchildren in the Western Cape Province of South Africa.
Methods
A total of 590 grade-4 schoolchildren residing in four informal settlements were studied. Spirometry and fractional exhaled nitric-oxide (FeNO) measurements were conducted, including a standardized questionnaire administered to caregivers at baseline and 12-months follow-up. Annual NO2 and PM2.5 levels were estimated for each child's home using land-use regression modelling. Single- and two-pollutant models were constructed to assess the independent and co-pollutant association of both air pollutants (NO2 and PM2.5) on new cases of asthma-associated outcomes adjusting-for host characteristics, indoor exposures and study area.
Results
The annual average concentration of PM2.5 and NO2 were 10.01$\mu$g/m3 and 16.62$\mu$g/m3 respectively, across the four study areas, and were below the local Standards of 20$\mu$g/m3 and 40$\mu$g/m3, for both pollutants, respectively. In the two-pollutant-adjusted models, an interquartile range (IQR) increase of 14.2$\mu$g/m3 in NO2 was associated with an increased risk of new onset of ocular-nasal symptoms (adjusted odds ratio–aOR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.01–2.60), wheezing (aOR: 3.57, 95% CI: 1.18–10.92), more than two or more asthma symptom score (aOR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.02–2.86), and airway inflammation defined as FeNO > 35 ppb (aOR: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.10–8.71), independent of PM2.5 exposures.
Conclusion
This study provided evidence that ambient NO2 levels below local standards and international guidelines, independent of PM2.5 exposure, increases new cases of asthma-associated outcomes after 12-months.},

The present study examined the associations between exposure to ambient air pollutants and respiratory symptoms in children. In this cross-sectional study, 1070 children under the age of seven years were recruited from 61 day-care centers of Tehran in 2015. Initially, day-care centers were selected at a radius of 2 km from the air pollution monitoring stations, and subsequently all the children attending these day-care centers were interviewed. The data on the respiratory complaints of children were obtained by using the ATS questionnaire (ATS-DLD-78-C). Moreover, the annual average concentration of pollutants was calculated based on the time children spent at home and at the day-care center using the air pollution monitoring stations. Crude and adjusted logistic regression analysis was conducted. The findings indicated that ambient air SO2 and NO2 concentrations near home were associated with current asthma for 1 part per billion (ppb) increase with an OR of 1.20 (1.00–1.45) and 1.08 (1.01–1.15), respectively. The odds of developing persistent phlegm for each unit (ppm) of raise in the average annual concentration of CO in ambient air near home (OR 1.40; 1.09 to 1.81) increased as well. The daily mean concentration of PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 was higher than the limits provided in the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines (AQGS). Moreover, the prevalence of severe wheezing, asthma history, and bronchitis was higher in boys. Therefore, long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants such as SO2, NO2, and CO may be associated with an increase in current asthma and persistent phlegm in children.},

The two events were supposed to be correlated, also based on the limited information available about the new virus. Despite that clear indications about the role of particulate matter (PM) in the virus mechanism dispersion cannot be found in literature, some researchers supposed that PM can act as virus carrier, promoting its diffusion through the air. This paper, for the first time, analyses the PM10 situation in Lombardy (from 10th February to March 27, 2020), several days before the sanitary emergency explosion. The data of the detected infection cases are reported and discussed parallelly. As a comparison, the situation of Piedmont, located near to the Lombardy is also presented. Data are reported for Brescia, Bergamo, Cremona, Lodi, Milano, Monza-Brianza, Pavia (Lombardy), Alessandria, Vercelli, Novara, Biella, Asti, and Torino (Piedmont). The results show that it is not possible to conclude that COVID-19 diffusion mechanism also occurs through the air, by using PM10 as a carrier. In particular, it is shown that Piedmont cities, presenting lower detected infections cases in comparison to Brescia and Bergamo in the investigated period, had most sever PM10 pollution events in comparison to Lombardy cities. This first study may serve as a reference to better understand and predict the factors affecting the COVID-19 diffusion and transmission routes, focusing on the role of air particulate matter in the atmosphere.},

We investigated 14,993 patients with confirmed influenza cases from January 2013 to December 2017 in Chongqing, a mountainous city in southwest China. We developed distributed lag non-linear models with quasi-Poisson link to take into account the lag and non-linear effects of NO2 exposure on influenza prevalence. We estimated that the cumulative effect of a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in NO2 with seven-day lag (i.e., summing all the contributions up to seven days) corresponded to relative risk of 1.24 (95% CI: 1.17–1.31) in daily influenza prevalence. Comparing to annual mean of the World Health Organization air quality guidelines of 40 $\mu$g/m3 for NO2, we estimated that 14.01% (95% CI: 10.69–17.08%) of the influenza cases were attributable to excessive NO2 exposure. Our results suggest that NO2 exposure could worsen the risk of influenza infection in this mountainous city, filling the gap of relevant researches in densely populated and mountainous cities.

Children diagnosed with asthma from age 0–3 were defined as having early onset asthma. Children diagnosed with asthma from age 4–9 were defined as having late onset asthma. Mean NO2 exposure for each quartile was 6.31 ppb, 9.45 ppb, 11.83 ppb, and 17.9 ppb. Higher levels of NO2 exposure were more strongly associated with early childhood asthma (Quartile 3 OR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.29, 3.44, Quartile 4 OR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.27, 3.68) compared to the lowest level of NO2 exposure (Quartile 1). No such association was observed with risk of late childhood asthma onset. Asthma susceptibility to NO2 exposure may vary with the childhood developmental stage, and young children may be susceptible to NO2 exposure at levels well below national and international guidelines. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering the timing of childhood asthma onset in future studies and confirms the increased risk of early onset of childhood asthma associated even with relatively low NO2 exposure levels.},

abstract = {Background
Respiratory diseases are a major component of morbidity in children and their symptoms may be spatially and temporally exacerbated by exposure gradients of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in large polluted urban areas, like the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA).
Objectives
To analyze the association between satellite-derived and interpolated PM2.5 estimates with children's (≤9 years old) acute respiratory symptoms (ARS) in two probabilistic samples representing the MCMA.
Methods
We obtained ARS data from the 2006 and 2012 National Surveys for Health and Nutrition (ENSaNut). Two week average exposure to PM2.5 was assessed for each household with spatial estimates from a hybrid model with satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD-PM2.5) and also with interpolated PM2.5 measurements from ground stations, from the Mexico City monitoring network (MNW-PM2.5). We used survey-adjusted logistic regressions to analyze the association between PM2.5 estimates and ARS reported on children.
Results
A total of 1,005 and 1,233 children were surveyed in 2006 and 2012 representing 3.1 and 3.5 million children, respectively. For the same years and over the periods of study, the estimated prevalence of ARS decreased from 49.4% (95% CI: 44.9,53.9%) to 37.8% (95% CI: 34,41.7%). AOD-PM2.5 and MNW-PM2.5 estimates were associated with significantly higher reports of ARS in children 0–4 years old [OR2006 = 1.29 (95% (CI): 0.99,1.68) and OR2006 = 1.24 (95% CI: 1.08,1.42), respectively]. We observed positive non-significant associations in 2012 in both age groups and in 2006 for children 5–9 years old. No statistically significant differences in health effect estimates of PM2.5 were found comparing AOD-PM2.5 or MNW-PM2.5 for exposure assessment.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that PM2.5 is a risk factor for the prevalence of ARS in children and expand the growing evidence of the utility of new satellite AOD-based methods for estimating health effects from acute exposure to PM2.5.},

abstract = {Background
Despite evidence that ambient air pollution may play a role in the development of asthma, little is known about the potential contribution of industrial emissions.
Objective
We used a population-based birth cohort to investigate the association between asthma onset in childhood and residential exposure to industrial emissions, estimated from atmospheric dispersion modeling.
Methods
The study population comprised all children born in the province of Quebec, Canada, 2002-2011. Asthma onset were ascertained from health administrative databases with validated algorithms. We used atmospheric dispersion modeling to develop time-varying annual mean concentration of ambient PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 at participants' residence from industries. For each pollutant, we assessed the association between industrial emissions exposure and childhood asthma onset using Cox proportional hazard model, adjusted for sex, material and social deprivation and calendar year. Sensitivity analysis included adjusting for long-term regional and traffic-related ambient PM2.5 and NO2, and assessing potential confounding by unmeasured secondhand smoke.
Results
The cohort included 722,667 children and 66,559 incident cases of asthma. For all pollutants, we found a non-linear association between childhood asthma onset and residential ambient air pollutant concentration from industries, with stronger effects at lower concentrations. A change from 25th to the 75th percentile in the mean annual ambient concentration of PM2.5 (0.13 $\mu$g/m3), NO2 (1.0 $\mu$g/m3) and SO2 (1.6 $\mu$g/m3) from industrial emissions was associated with a 19% (95% CI: 17-20%), 21% (95% CI: 19-23%) and 23% (95% CI: 21-24%) increase in the risk of asthma onset in children, respectively. For PM2.5 and NO2, associations were persisting after adjustments for long-term regional PM2.5 and traffic-related NO2 ambient concentration. Conclusion: Residential exposure to industrial emissions estimated from dispersion modeling was associated with asthma onset in childhood. Importantly, associations were stronger at lower concentrations and independent from those of other sources, thus adding up to the burden of regional and traffic-related air pollution.},

abstract = {Background
The proportion of asthma patients with mild to moderate exacerbations is far greater than the number who experience episodes that are severe enough to require emergency room visits or hospital admission. However the routinely collected data from hospitals is absent in the past.
Objective
To evaluate associations between short-term exposures to air pollutants and hospital outpatient visits for asthma in China.
Methods
We obtained data for 143,057 asthma outpatient visits from the largest hospitals in 17 Chinese cities, between Jan 01 2013 and Dec 31 2015. We used daily concentrations of air pollutants measured by the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design, and fitted conditional logistic regression models to determine the associations.
Results
Particulate matter ≤10$\mu$m in diameter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were associated with increased risks of hospital outpatient visits for asthma on the same day, while the effects were delayed for particulate matter ≤2.5$\mu$m in diameter (PM2.5) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). For the cumulative effect model at lag05 days, 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in air pollutants concentrations were correlated with hospital outpatient visits for asthma with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals 1.004 (1.000-1.008) for PM2.5, 1.005 (1.002-1.008) for PM10, 1.030 (1.021-1.040) for NO2, and 1.015 (1.008-1.021) for SO2. Almost one in nine (10.9%; 7.7, 13.9%) hospital outpatient visits for asthma were attributable to NO2.
Conclusion
Short-term exposures to PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and SO2 were associated with hospital outpatient visits for asthma in China.},

However, few studies on the effects of ambient air pollution on human health have been conducted in Vietnam so far. The aim of this study is to examine the association between PM2.5 and hospital admission due to acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) among children aged < 5 years old in Ho Chi Minh city, the largest city of Vietnam. Data relating PM2.5 and hospital admission were collected from February 2016–December 2017 and a time series regression analysis was performed to examine the relationship between PM2.5 and hospital admission including the delayed effect up to three days prior to the admission. We found that each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with an increase of 3.51 (95%CI: 0.96–6.12) risk of ALRI admission among children. According to the analysis, male children are more sensitive to exposure to PM2.5 than females, while children exposed to PM2.5 are more likely to be infected with acute bronchiolitis than with pneumonia. The study demonstrated that young children in HCMC are at increased risk of ALRI admissions due to the high level of PM2.5 concentration in the city's ambient air.},

abstract = {Background
The current evidence has presented mixed results between air pollutants exposure and the progression of tuberculosis (TB). The purpose of this study was to explore the association between short-term exposure to air pollutants and the risk of TB outpatient visits in Hefei, China.
Methods
Time-series analysis was used to assess the effect of short-term exposure to ambient air pollutants on the risk of TB outpatient visits. A Poisson generalized linear regression model combined with a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) was applied to explore the association. The effects of different gender (male, female), age (≤65 years old, >65 years old) and season (cold season, warm season) on the risk of TB were investigated by stratified analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of our findings.
Results
A total of 22,749 active TB cases were identified from November 1, 2013 to December 31, 2018 in Hefei. The overall exposure-response curve showed that the concentration of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure were positively correlated with the risk of TB outpatient visits, while ozone (O3) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) exposure were negatively correlated with the risk of TB outpatient visits. The maximum lag-specific and cumulative relative risk (RR) of TB outpatient visits were 1.057 [95%CI: 1.002–1.115, lag 3 day] and 1.559 (95%CI: 1.057–2.300, lag 13 days) for each 10 $\mu$g/m³ increase in PM2.5; 1.026 (95% CI: 1.008–1.044, lag 0 day) and 1.559 (95%CI: 1.057–2.300, lag 07 days) for each 10 $\mu$g/m³ increase in NO2; 0.866 (95% CI: 0.801–0.935, lag 5 day) and 0.852 (95%CI: 1.01–1.11, lag 0–14 days) for each 10 $\mu$g/m³ increase in SO2 in the single-pollutant model. There was only a negative association between O3 exposure and the cumulative risk of TB outpatient visits (RR = 0.960, 95%CI: 0.936–0.984, lag 07 days). Stratified analyses showed that the effects of SO2 and O3 exposure were different between warm and cold seasons. The effect of NO2 exposure remained statistically significant in male, younger, and cold season subgroups. Besides, elderly people are more susceptible to PM2.5 exposure.
Conclusion
This study suggests that exposure to PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and O3 are associated with the risk of TB outpatient visits. Seasonal variation may have a greater impact on the risk of TB outpatient visits compared with gender and age.},

Miners are highly exposed to diesel exhaust emissions from powered equipment. Although biologically plausible, there is little evidence based on quantitative exposure assessment, that long-term diesel exposure increases risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To fill this gap, we examined COPD mortality and diesel exhaust exposure in the Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study (DEMS).
Methods
We fit Cox models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for COPD mortality and cumulative exposure ($\mu$g/m3-years) to respirable elemental carbon (REC), a key metric for diesel exhaust exposure. Separate models were fit for ever-underground and surface-only miners to allow for effect modification. Exposure was lagged by 0, 10 and 15 years. In a secondary analysis, we addressed the healthy worker survivor effect by applying the parametric g-formula to handle time-varying confounding affected by prior exposure among ever-underground workers.
Results
Based on 140 cases, the HRs for COPD mortality increased as categories of lagged REC exposure increased for all workers. Among surface-only workers, those in the middle exposure category (0 lag) had a significantly elevated hazard ratio of 2.34 (95% CI: 1.11–4.61) relative to those in the lowest category. Among the ever-underground, that ratio was 1.35, with wide confidence intervals. Using the g-formula, we estimated that the lifetime cumulative risk of COPD mortality would have been reduced from the observed 5.0%–3.1% under a hypothetical intervention where all ever-underground workers were always unexposed.
Conclusions
Our results suggest long term exposure to diesel exhaust may increase risk of COPD in miners, though power was limited.},

abstract = {Exposure to airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with a variety of respiratory health effects and contributes to premature mortality. Lymphatic vessels are instrumental in facilitating the transport of toxic materials away from the lung to maintain alveolar clearance and have been shown to play important roles in lung injury and repair. Despite intense research efforts in delineating the effects of PM2.5 on blood vascular endothelial cells, the impacts of PM2.5 on lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), a specialized subset of endothelial cells that comprise lymphatic vessels, remain enigmatic. Here, we conducted MTT assay and show that treatment of human pulmonary LECs with PM2.5 suppresses cell viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We subsequently performed Annexin V/propidium iodide labeling and demonstrate that PM2.5 induces LECs apoptosis and necrosis. Furthermore, we found that manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) expression and mitochondrial SOD activity were profoundly reduced following PM2.5 exposure. Mechanistically, we provide compelling evidence that PM2.5 reduces SOD2 expression through activation of Akt pathway, which leads to a disruption of mitochondrial redox homeostasis characterized by increased accumulation of mitochondrial superoxide. Conversely, mitochondria-targeted SOD mimetic (MitoTEMPO) corrects the disturbed oxidative milieu in PM2.5-treated LECs. Additionally, MitoTEMPO ameliorates the deleterious impacts of PM2.5 on mitochondrial DNA integrity and preserves the viability of LECs. Taken together, these novel data support a critical role for mitochondrial superoxide in the pathogenesis of PM2.5-induced LECs injury and identity mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants as promising therapeutic options to treat environmental lung diseases. Our findings are limited to experimental studies with primary LECs, and future investigations in animal models are warranted to shed light on the precise pathophysiology of lymphatic system in response to PM exposure.},

abstract = {Background
Short-term exposure to ambient air pollution (AAP) has been widely linked to asthma morbidity such as outpatient and emergency visits and hospitalization. Up to date, however, the acute effects of AAP exposure on asthma mortality remained largely unknown possibly due to the rare occurrence of asthma deaths.
Objectives
This study aimed to investigate whether the death risks from asthma are triggered by short-term AAP exposures in a Chinese urban population who suffered poor air quality.
Methods
1385 asthma death cases were identified from the total 61.3 thousand death records in two urban districts in Wuhan, central China, 2003–2013. We performed a time-stratified case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression models were applied to assess short-term associations of air pollutants (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 $\mu$m [PM10], sulfur dioxide [SO2], and nitrogen dioxide [NO2]) along different exposure days with asthma mortality.
Results
A total of 1385 case days and 4668 control days were investigated during the study period. Daily mean concentrations of PM10, SO2, and NO2 were 116.6 $\mu$g/m3, 53.4 $\mu$g/m3, and 60.7 $\mu$g/m3, respectively. A 10 $\mu$g/m3 rise in exposure to SO2 and NO2 at 2 days prior to death (lag 2 days), was associated with increased asthma death risks of 2.9% (odds ratio [OR] = 1.029, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.006, 1.053) and 4.3% (OR = 1.043, 95% CI: 1.012, 1.076), respectively. No evident PM10-asthma associations were identified in all subpopulations except for those aged 85+ years (OR = 1.022, 95% CI: 1.001 to 1.044). In our stratified analyses, significant effects of SO2 and NO2 were only observed in female, the older elderly, 7+ years-educated and unmarried persons, as well as those died outside the hospital and in cold season. We observed some evidence for effect modification by age, with p-values of 0.032 for PM10 and 0.051 for SO2, suggesting higher vulnerability to air pollution among the older asthma cases.
Conclusions
This study provided suggestive evidence for the short-term association between air pollution exposure and asthma death in highly polluted urban areas. Several days' high-level exposures to air pollutants, particularly SO2 and NO2, may elevate risks of asthma death. Our findings highlighted the potential health benefits from intervention and preventive actions targeted to reducing AAP exposure among asthma patients.},

abstract = {Background
The risk of infection and death by COVID-19 could be associated with a heterogeneous distribution at a small area level of environmental, socioeconomic and demographic factors. Our objective was to investigate, at a small area level, whether long-term exposure to air pollutants increased the risk of COVID-19 incidence and death in Catalonia, Spain, controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors.
Methods
We used a mixed longitudinal ecological design with the study population consisting of small areas in Catalonia for the period February 25 to May 16, 2020. We estimated Generalized Linear Mixed models in which we controlled for a wide range of observed and unobserved confounders as well as spatial and temporal dependence.
Results
We have found that long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and, to a lesser extent, to coarse particles (PM10) have been independent predictors of the spatial spread of COVID-19. For every 1 $\mu$m/m3 above the mean the risk of a positive test case increased by 2.7% (95% credibility interval, ICr: 0.8%, 4.7%) for NO2 and 3.0% (95% ICr: -1.4%,7.44%) for PM10. Regions with levels of NO2 exposure in the third and fourth quartile had 28.8% and 35.7% greater risk of a death, respectively, than regions located in the first two quartiles.
Conclusion
Although it is possible that there are biological mechanisms that explain, at least partially, the association between long-term exposure to air pollutants and COVID-19, we hypothesize that the spatial spread of COVID-19 in Catalonia is attributed to the different ease with which some people, the hosts of the virus, have infected others. That facility depends on the heterogeneous distribution at a small area level of variables such as population density, poor housing and the mobility of its residents, for which exposure to pollutants has been a surrogate.},

abstract = {Exposure to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) has been related to the increasing incidence and mortality of pulmonary diseases, where microRNAs (miRNAs) play significant roles in these biological and pathological processes. In the present study, we found that miR-382-5p played an anti-inflammatory role in pulmonary inflammation induced by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) or diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) in vitro and in vivo. The expression level of miR-382-5p was downregulated, while its target gene, namely CXCL12, was elevated in HBE cells after exposure to PM2.5 or DEPs. Mechanistically, PM2.5 or DEPs exposure increased CXCL12/MMP9 expression via miR-382-5p inhibition, subsequently triggered pulmonary inflammation. Furthermore, antagonizing the function of CXCL12 significantly reduced the expression of MMP9 and local inflammation induced by PM2.5 or DEPs. PM2.5 or DEPs caused apoptosis and G1 phase arrest could be partially restored by overexpression of miR-382-5p and antagonism of CXCL12. In a murine model, enhanced miR-382-5p expression effectively reduced expression levels of CXCL12, MMP9 and inflammatory cytokines, hereby protected lung tissues against PM2.5 or DEPs-induced lesions.

abstract = {Particulate matter (PM), the collection of all liquid and solid particles suspended in air, includes both organic and inorganic particles, many of which are health-hazards. PM particles with a diameter equal to or less than 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) is a form of air pollutant that causes significant lung damage when inhaled. Maslinic acid (MA) prevents oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory cytokine generation, but there is little information available regarding its role in PM-induced lung injury. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the protective activity of MA against PM2.5-induced lung injury. The mice were divided into seven groups (n = 10 each): a mock control group, an MA control (0.8 mg/kg mouse body weight) group, an opted PM2.5 produced from diesel (10 mg/kg mouse body weight) group, a diesel PM2.5+MA (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/kg mouse body weight) groups. Mice were treated with MA via tail-vein injection 30 min after the intratracheal instillation of a diesel PM2.5. Changes in the wet/dry weight ratio of the lung tissue, total protein/total cell and lymphocyte counts, inflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), vascular permeability, and histology were monitored in diesel PM2.5-treated mice. The results showed that MA reduced pathological lung injury, the wet/dry weight ratio of the lung tissue, and hyperpermeability caused by diesel PM2.5. MA also inhibited diesel PM2.5-induced myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the lung tissue, decreased the levels of diesel PM2.5-induced inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$ and interleukin (IL)-1$\beta$, reduced nitric oxide (NO) and total protein in the BALF, and effectively attenuated diesel PM2.5-induced increases in the number of lymphocytes in the BALF. In addition, MA increased the protein phosphorylation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and dramatically suppressed diesel PM2.5-stimulated expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), MyD88, and the autophagy-related proteins LC3 II and Beclin 1. In conclusion, these findings indicate that MA has a critical anti-inflammatory effect due to its ability to regulate both the TLR4-MyD88 and mTOR-autophagy pathways and may thus be a potential therapeutic agent against diesel PM2.5-induced lung injury.},

Ambient nitrogen dioxide is associated with asthma occurrence in adults in Western countries. However, two recent large-scale studies have provided inconclusive results regarding this association. Moreover, the association remains unknown in an Asian population.
Objective
We aimed to investigate the association between ambient air pollution exposure and incident adult asthma.
Methods
From 2016 to 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional self-administered questionnaire survey with retrospective follow-up of incident asthma cases among schoolchildren's parents from 41 schools within 1 km of air monitoring stations distributed throughout the main island of Taiwan. To estimate participants' exposure, air pollution data of air monitoring stations within 1 km of schools from where participants were sampled were inputted into the proximity model. We used mixed logistic regression models to determine the association between air pollution exposure and asthma onset within five years prior to the survey.
Results
The questionnaire was completed for a total of 11 585 participants out of 13 424 candidates (response rate, 86.3%). Among 9131 participants aged from 26 to 50 years, 101 were diagnosed with asthma within the five years prior to the survey. The prevalence of incident asthma cases was 2.2 per 1000 person-years. Those exposed to higher ambient nitrogen dioxide (odds ratio = 1.20 per interquartile [5.7 ppb] of nitrogen dioxide, 95% CI = 1.02–1.42) were more likely to develop adult-onset asthma.
Conclusion
In an Asian population, exposure to higher ambient nitrogen dioxide is associated with increased prevalence of incident asthma cases among adults aged 26–50 years.},

Ambient environmental pollutants have been shown to adversely affect respiratory health in susceptible populations. However, the role of simultaneous exposure to multiple diverse environmental pollutants is poorly understood.
Objective
We applied a multidomain, multipollutant approach to assess the association between pediatric lung function measures and selected ambient air pollutants and pesticides.
Methods
Using data from the US EPA and California Pesticide Use Registry, we reconstructed three months prior exposure to ambient air pollutants ((ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter with a median aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) and <10 $\mu$m (PM10)) and pesticides (organophosphates (OP), carbamates (C) and methyl bromide (MeBr)) for 153 children with mild intermittent or mild persistent asthma from the San Joaquin Valley of California, USA. We implemented Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to estimate the association between simultaneous exposures to air pollutants and pesticides and lung function measures (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of vital capacity (FEF25–75)).
Results
In BKMR analysis, the overall effect of mixtures (pollutants and pesticides) was associated with reduced FEV1 and FVC, particularly when all the environmental exposures were above their 60th percentile. For example, the effect of the overall mixture at the 70th percentile (compared to the median) was a −0.12SD (−50 mL, 95% CI: −180 mL, 90 mL) change in the FEV1 and a −0.18SD (−90 mL, 95% CI: −240 mL, 60 mL) change in the FVC. However, 95% credible intervals around all of the joint effect estimates contained the null value.
Conclusion
At this agricultural-urban interface, we observed results from multipollutant analyses, suggestive of adverse effects on some pediatric lung function measures following a cumulative increase in ambient air pollutants and agricultural pesticides. Given the uncertainty in effect estimates, this approach should be explored in larger studies.},

SO2 and PM10 concentration data were obtained from six air quality monitoring stations spatially distributed in the area. PM2.5 samples were collected at the same locations with a MiniVol sampler over a 24-h period on alternating days. The PM2.5 components were analysed using the energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence and reflectance techniques. Hospital care and admission events due to acute respiratory diseases (n = 8,987) of the coded groups JJ00-JJ99 of the International Code of Diseases (ICD-10) were obtained from three hospitals (one public and two private hospitals). To quantify the association of acute respiratory disease events with pollutant concentrations, a generalized additive model (GAM) with a Poisson distribution was applied. The results showed a greater risk of acute respiratory events due to exposure to SO2 with a relative risk of 1.28 (95% CI: 1.22–1.34) and to PM10 with a risk of 1.14 (95% CI: 1.09–1.20) on the day of exposure (lag 0).

Little information exists on interaction effects between air pollution and influenza vaccination on allergic respiratory diseases. We conducted a large population-based study to evaluate the interaction effects between influenza vaccination and long-term exposure to ambient air pollution on allergic respiratory diseases in children and adolescents.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was investigated during 2012–2013 in 94 schools from Seven Northeastern Cities (SNEC) in China. Questionnaires surveys were obtained from 56 137 children and adolescents aged 2–17 years. Influenza vaccination was defined as receipt of the influenza vaccine. We estimated air pollutants exposure [nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters ≤1 $\mu$m (PM1), ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) and ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10)] using machine learning methods. We employed two-level generalized linear mix effects model to examine interactive effects between influenza vaccination and air pollution exposure on allergic respiratory diseases (asthma, asthma-related symptoms and allergic rhinitis), after controlling for important covariates.
Results
We found statistically significant interactions between influenza vaccination and air pollutants on allergic respiratory diseases and related symptoms (doctor-diagnosed asthma, current wheeze, wheeze, persistent phlegm and allergic rhinitis). The adjusted ORs for doctor-diagnosed asthma, current wheeze and allergic rhinitis among the unvaccinated group per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM1 and PM2.5 were significantly higher than the corresponding ORs among the vaccinated group [For PM1, doctor-diagnosed asthma: OR: 1.89 (95%CI: 1.57–2.27) vs 1.65 (95%CI: 1.36–2.00); current wheeze: OR: 1.50 (95%CI: 1.22–1.85) vs 1.10 (95%CI: 0.89–1.37); allergic rhinitis: OR: 1.38 (95%CI: 1.15–1.66) vs 1.21 (95%CI: 1.00–1.46). For PM2.5, doctor-diagnosed asthma: OR: 1.81 (95%CI: 1.52–2.14) vs 1.57 (95%CI: 1.32–1.88); current wheeze: OR: 1.46 (95%CI: 1.21–1.76) vs 1.11 (95%CI: 0.91–1.35); allergic rhinitis: OR: 1.35 (95%CI: 1.14–1.60) vs 1.19 (95%CI: 1.00–1.42)]. The similar patterns were observed for wheeze and persistent phlegm. The corresponding p values for interactions were less than 0.05, respectively. We assessed the risks of PM1-related and PM2.5-related current wheeze were decreased by 26.67% (95%CI: 1.04%–45.66%) and 23.97% (95%CI: 0.21%–42.08%) respectively, which was attributable to influenza vaccination (both p for efficiency <0.05).
Conclusions
Influenza vaccination may play an important role in mitigating the detrimental effects of long-term exposure to ambient air pollution on childhood allergic respiratory diseases. Policy targeted at increasing influenza vaccination may yield co-benefits in terms of reduced allergic respiratory diseases.},

abstract = {Objective
To quantify the acute effect of ambient air pollution on the risk of respiratory diseases in children in a Chinese subtropical city, and to investigate whether seasonal influenza and season could modify this association.
Methods
A Generalized Additive Model was performed to evaluate the association between ambient air pollutants, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5), respirable particulate matter (PM10), ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and children's hospital visits for respiratory diseases in Shenzhen, China. Potential effect modification was identified by stratified analysis in terms of seasonal influenza and seasons. The robustness of the results was assessed by sensitivity analyses.
Results
A total of 2,569,021 hospital visits for respiratory diseases were recorded among children under 15 years old. We observed significant acute effects of air pollution, and the largest effects were observed during lag2 (two days after exposure) for PM2.5 [excess risk (ER) = 2.50% (95% CI: 1.88%, 3.12%)], PM10 [ER = 1.79% (95% CI: 1.37%, 2.21%)], O3 [ER = 0.59% (95% CI: 0.23%, 0.95%)], and SO2 [ER = 7.84% (95% CI: 5.17%, 10.58%)], and during lag0 (day of exposure) for NO2 [ER = 2.39% (95% CI: 1.74%, 3.05%)]. Season modified these effects with stronger associations being observed during the cold season. Seasonal influenza modified the effects of particulate matters towards stronger association during seasonal influenza epidemic, but this modification was not statistically significant.
Conclusion
Ambient air pollutants, specifically PM2.5, PM10, O3, SO2, and NO2, were significantly associated with increased child hospital visits for respiratory diseases in Shenzhen, China. The vulnerable windows for these effects were the cold season and seasonal influenza epidemics.},

abstract = {Air pollution can increase the risk of respiratory diseases, enhancing the susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections. Some studies suggest that small air particles facilitate the spread of viruses and also of the new coronavirus, besides the direct person-to-person contagion. However, the effects of the exposure to particulate matter and other contaminants on SARS-CoV-2 has been poorly explored. Here we examined the possible reasons why the new coronavirus differently impacted on Italian regional and provincial populations. With the help of artificial intelligence, we studied the importance of air pollution for mortality and positivity rates of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Italy. We discovered that among several environmental, health, and socio-economic factors, air pollution and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), as its main component, resulted as the most important predictors of SARS-CoV-2 effects. We also found that the emissions from industries, farms, and road traffic - in order of importance - might be responsible for more than 70% of the deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2 nationwide. Given the major contribution played by air pollution (much more important than other health and socio-economic factors, as we discovered), we projected that, with an increase of 5–10% in air pollution, similar future pathogens may inflate the epidemic toll of Italy by 21–32% additional cases, whose 19–28% more positives and 4–14% more deaths. Our findings, demonstrating that fine-particulate (PM2.5) pollutant level is the most important factor to predict SARS-CoV-2 effects that would worsen even with a slight decrease of air quality, highlight that the imperative of productivity before health and environmental protection is, indeed, a short-term/small-minded resolution.},

Although residing in lower surrounding greenness and transient exposure to air pollution are independently associated with higher risk of adverse health outcomes, little is known about their interactions.
Objectives
We examine whether residential neighborhood greenness modifies the short-term association between air pollution and respiratory mortality among the participants of Chinese Elderly Health Service Cohort in Hong Kong.
Methods
We estimated residential surrounding greenness by measuring satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat within catchments of residential addresses of participants who died of respiratory diseases between 1998 and 2011. We first dichotomized NDVI into low and high greenness and used a time-stratified case-crossover approach to estimate the percent excess risk of respiratory mortality associated with fine particulate matter (PM2.5), respirable particulate matter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). We further classified NDVI into greenness quartiles and introduced an interaction term between air pollution and the assigned median values of the NDVI quartiles into the models to assess the trend of greenness modification on the air pollution and respiratory mortality associations.
Results
Among 3159 respiratory deaths during the follow-up, 2058 were from pneumonia and 947 from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Elders living in the low greenness areas were associated with a higher risk of pneumonia mortality attributed to NO2 (p = 0.049) and O3 (p = 0.025). The mortality risk of pneumonia showed a decreasing trend for NO2 (p for trend = 0.041), O3 (p for trend = 0.006), and PM2.5 (p for trend = 0.034) with greenness quartiles increasing from Quartile 1 (lowest) to Quartile 4 (highest).
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that elders living in higher greenness areas are less susceptible to pneumonia mortality associated with air pollution, which provides evidence for optimizing allocation, siting, and quality of urban green space to minimize detrimental health effects of air pollution.},

abstract = {Background
Ambient air pollution exposure and influenza virus infection have been documented to be independently associated with reduced lung function previously. Influenza vaccination plays an important role in protecting against influenza-induced severe diseases. However, no study to date has focused on whether influenza vaccination may modify the associations between ambient air pollution exposure and lung function.
Methods
We undertook a cross-sectional study of 6740 children aged 7–14 years into Seven Northeast Cities (SNEC) Study in China during 2012–2013. We collected information from parents/guardians about sociodemographic factors and influenza vaccination status in the past three years. Lung function was measured using portable electronic spirometers. Machine learning methods were used to predict 4-year average ambient air pollutant exposures to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <1 $\mu$m (PM1), <2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) and <10 $\mu$m (PM10). Two-level linear and logistic regression models were used to assess interactions between influenza vaccination and long-term ambient air pollutants exposure on lung function reduction, controlling for potential confounding factors.
Results
Ambient air pollution were observed significantly associated with reductions in lung function among children. We found significant interactions between influenza vaccination and air pollutants on lung function, suggesting greater vulnerability to air pollution among unvaccinated children. For example, an interaction (pinteraction = 0.002) indicated a −283.44 mL (95% CI: −327.04, −239.83) reduction in forced vital capacity (FVC) per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM1 concentrations among unvaccinated children, compared with the −108.24 mL (95%CI: −174.88, −41.60) reduction in FVC observed among vaccinated children. Results from logistic regression models also showed stronger associations between per IQR increase in PM1 and lung function reduction measured by FVC and peak expiratory flow (PEF) among unvaccinated children than the according ORs among vaccinated children [i.e., Odds Ratio (OR) for PM1 and impaired FVC: 2.33 (95%CI: 1.79, 3.03) vs 1.65 (95%CI: 1.20, 2.28); OR for PM2.5 and impaired PEF: 1.45 (95%CI: 1.12,1.87) vs 1.04 (95%CI: 0.76,1.43)]. The heterogeneity of the modification by influenza vaccination of the associations between air pollution exposure and lung function reduction appeared to be more substantial in girls than in boys.
Conclusion
Our results suggest that influenza vaccination may moderate the detrimental effects of ambient air pollution on lung function among children. This study provides new insights into the possible co-benefits of strengthening and promoting global influenza vaccination programs among children.},

Exposure to ambient air pollution is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality from lung and heart disease.
Research question
Does short term exposure to ambient air pollution influence COVID-19 related mortality?
Study design and methodology
Using time series analyses we tested the association between daily changes in air pollution measured by stationary monitors in and around Santiago, Chile and deaths from laboratory confirmed or suspected COVID-19 between March 16 and August 31, 2020. Results were adjusted for temporal trends, temperature and humidity, and stratified by age and sex.
Results
There were 10,069 COVID-19 related deaths of which 7659 were laboratory confirmed. Using distributed lags, the cumulative relative risk (RR) (95% CI) of mortality for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in CO, NO2 and PM2.5 were 1.061 (1.033–1.089), 1.067 (1.023–1.103) and 1.058 (1.034–1.082), respectively There were no significant differences in RR by sex.. In those at least 85 years old, an IQR increase in NO2 was associated with a 12.7% (95% CI 4.2–22.2) increase in daily mortality.
Conclusion
This study provides evidence that daily increases in air pollution increase the risk of dying from COVID-19, especially in the elderly.},

We recognized the number of daily respiratory mortality data from Tehran's cemetery registration from 2014 to 2019. We employed a Poisson regression model with natural spline functions to adjust air pollution and daily respiratory mortality data with temperature, long-term, and seasonality. The mean concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, O3, CO, SO2, and NO2 were 29.8 $\mu$g/m3, 78.7 $\mu$g/m3, 220.4 part per billion (ppb), 2.3 part per million (ppm), 9.7 ppb, and 49.6 ppb, respectively. The percent change and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for mortality from respiratory causes due to 10-$\mu$g/m3 increment in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were 4.5% (95% CI: 0.3–9.5%) and 2.5% (95% CI: 0.1–3.5%) in the adjusted model, respectively. The percent change of respiratory death was significant for SO2 (2.8% per 1 ppb increment, 95% CI: 0.5–19.5%), NO2 (1.5% per 1 ppb increment, 95% CI: 0.8–15%) and O3 (0.6% per 1 ppb increment, 95% CI: 0.1–1.1%) exposure in adjusted model. Stronger associations obtained among elderly and women subjects. Conclusively, the findings of the present study suggest that the risk of respiratory death was associated with PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and O3 exposure.},

abstract = {Short-term exposure to air pollution, as well as to climate variables have been linked to a higher incidence of respiratory viral diseases. The study aims to assess the short-term influence of air pollution and climate on COVID19 incidence in Lombardy (Italy), during the early stage of the outbreak, before the implementation of the lockdown measures. The daily number of COVID19 cases in Lombardy from February 25th to March 10th, 2020, and the daily average concentrations up to 15 days before the study period of particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), O3, SO2, and NO2 together with climate variables (temperature, relative humidity – RH%, wind speed, precipitation), were analyzed. A univariable mixed model with a logarithm transformation as link function was applied for each day, from 15 days (lag15) to one day (lag1) before the day of detected cases, to evaluate the effect of each variable. Additionally, change points (Break Points-BP) in the relationship between incident cases and air pollution or climatic factors were estimated. The results did not show a univocal relationship between air quality or climate factors and COVID19 incidence. PM10, PM2.5 and O3 concentrations in the last lags seem to be related to an increased COVID19 incidence, probably due to an increased susceptibility of the host. In addition, low temperature and low wind speed in some lags resulted associated with increased daily COVID19 incidence. The findings observed suggest that these factors, in particular conditions and lags, may increase individual susceptibility to the development of viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2.},

abstract = {On December 31, 2019, the novel human coronavirus (COVID-19) was emerged in Wuhan city, China, which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). There is a much controversial debate about the major pathways of transmission of the virus including airborne route. The present work is a systematic literature review (SR) aimed to assess the association of air pollution especially particulate matter pollution in the transmission and acceleration of the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The systematic literature search was performed to identify the available studies published through October 31, 2020 concerning the transmission of the disease and particulate matter air pollution in four international electronic databases. From the results of the included studies, there are suggestions that atmospheric particulate matter pollution plays a role in the SARS-CoV-2 spread, but the literature has not confirmed that it enhances the transmission although some studies have proposed that atmospheric particulate matter can operate as a virus carrier, promoting its spread. Therefore, although PM concentration alone cannot be effective in spreading the COVID-19 disease, other meteorological and environmental parameters including size of particles in ambient air, weather conditions, wind speed, relative humidity (RH) and temperature are involved. Therefore, it is necessary to consider all influencing parameters to prevent the spreading of COVID-19 disease. More studies are required to strengthen the scientific evidence and support more definitive conclusions.},

abstract = {Previous nationwide studies have reported links between long-term concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and COVID-19 infection and mortality rates. In order to translate these results to the state level, we use Bayesian hierarchical models to explore potential links between long-term PM2.5 concentrations and census tract-level rates of COVID-19 outcomes (infections, hospitalizations, and deaths) in Colorado. We explicitly consider how the uncertainty in PM2.5 estimates affects our results by comparing four different PM2.5 surfaces from academic and governmental organizations. After controlling for 20 census tract-level covariates, we find that our results depend heavily on the choice of PM2.5 surface. Using PM2.5 estimates from the United States EPA, we find that a 1 $\mu$g/m3 increase in long-term PM2.5 concentrations is associated with a statistically significant 26% increase in the relative risk of hospitalizations and a 34% increase in mortality. Results for all other surfaces and outcomes were not statistically significant. At the same time, we find a clear association between communities of color and COVID-19 outcomes at the Colorado census tract level that is minimally affected by the choice of PM2.5 surface. A per-interquartile range (IQR) increase in the percent of non-African American people of color was associated with a 31%, 43%, and 56% increase in the relative risk of infection, hospitalization, and mortality respectively, while a per-IQR increase in the proportion of non-Hispanic African Americans was associated with a 4% and 7% increase in the relative risk of infections and hospitalizations. The current disagreement among the different PM2.5 estimates is a key factor limiting our ability to link environmental exposures and health outcomes at the census tract level. These results have strong implications for the implementation of an equitable public health response during the crisis and suggest targeted areas for additional air monitoring in Colorado.},

abstract = {One of the problems hardly clarified in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic crisis is to identify factors associated with a lower mortality of COVID-19 between countries to design strategies to cope with future pandemics in society. The study here confronts this problem by developing a global analysis based on more than 160 countries. This paper proposes that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, healthcare spending and air pollution of nations are critical factors associated with fatality rate of COVID-19. The statistical evidence seems in general to support that countries with a low average COVID-19 fatality rate have high expenditures in health sector >7.5% of GDP, high health expenditures per capita >2,300 and a lower exposure of population to days exceeding safe levels of particulate matter (PM2.5). Another relevant finding here is that these countries have lower case fatality rates (CFRs) of COVID-19, regardless a higher percentage of population aged more than 65 years. Overall, then, this study finds that an effective and proactive strategy to reduce the negative impact of future pandemics, driven by novel viral agents, has to be based on a planning of enhancement of healthcare sector and of environmental sustainability that can reduce fatality rate of infectious diseases in society.},

This article presents a national scale U.S. study that investigates whether racial/ethnic minorities, socioeconomically deprived residents, and other vulnerable groups are significantly overrepresented in counties where significantly higher COVID-19 incidence spatially coincides with higher respiratory health risks from outdoor exposure to hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). COVID-19 data from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering database are linked to respiratory risk estimates from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Air Toxics Assessment and variables from the 2018 American Community Survey. Bivariate local measures of spatial association are implemented to identify county clusters representing relationships between COVID-19 incidence rate and respiratory risk from HAP exposure. Socio-demographic characteristics of these clusters are compared using bivariate statistical tests and multivariable generalized estimating equations. Counties where greater COVID-19 incidence coincides significantly with higher HAP respiratory risk contain disproportionately higher percentages of non-Hispanic Black, socioeconomically deprived, and uninsured residents than all other U.S. counties, after controlling for spatial clustering, population density, older age, and other contextual factors. These significant socio-demographic inequities represent an important starting point for more detailed investigations of places facing the double burden of elevated COVID-19 prevalence and air pollution exposure, and also emphasize the urgent need to develop mitigation strategies for addressing both COVID-19 and chronic air pollution in socially vulnerable communities.},

@article{Saers2021,
abstract = {Background
Inhalation of small particulate matter (PM 2.5) may be associated with development of respiratory disease. Increased respiratory symptoms have been reported among military staff after service in countries with recurrent desert storms.
Objective
The aim was to investigate whether an assignment in a desert environment and exposure to desert storms are associated with negative effects on respiratory health.
Methods
In two cohorts of Swedish soldiers serving in Mali as part of the United Nations stabilization forces, examination with spirometry, determination of fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and a questionnaire including participant characteristics, symptoms, and exposure was performed before and after service. Ambient air sampling was conducted on-site. Paired t-test was used to compare pre- and post-variables on lung function data, FeNO and symptom level.
Results
Most indoor and outdoor air measurements of dust and silica were within the Swedish occupational exposure limit for PM2.5 and silica (<0.10–2.7 mg/m3 and <0.002–0.40 mg/m3, respectively) as well as for respirable dust and silica (0.056–0.078 mg/m3and 0.0033–0.025 mg/m3, respectively). In the subgroup of participants with reported exposure to desert storms during the stay in Mali, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was significantly lower after exposure than before the mission (mean litres (SD) 4.21 ± 0.66 vs 4.33 ± 0.72, p = 0.021).
Conclusion
Exposure to a desert storm was associated with a decrease in FEV1. Exposure to small particulate matter may contribute to the development of respiratory disease and thus spirometry should be performed after occupational exposure to desert storms.},

However, the association between long-term exposure to air pollutants, which increases cardiopulmonary damage, and vulnerability to COVID-19 has not yet been fully established. We collected data of confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first wave of the epidemic in mainland China. We fitted a generalized linear model using city-level COVID-19 cases and severe cases as the outcome, and long-term average air pollutant levels as the exposure. Our analysis was adjusted using several variables, including a mobile phone dataset, covering human movement from Wuhan before the travel ban and movements within each city during the period of the emergency response. Other variables included smoking prevalence, climate data, socioeconomic data, education level, and number of hospital beds for 324 cities in China. After adjusting for human mobility and socioeconomic factors, we found an increase of 37.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.8%–52.0%), 32.3% (95% CI: 22.5%–42.4%), and 14.2% (7.9%–20.5%) in the number of COVID-19 cases for every 10-$\mu$g/m3 increase in long-term exposure to NO2, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively. However, when stratifying the data according to population size, the association became non-significant. The present results are derived from a large, newly compiled and geocoded repository of population and epidemiological data relevant to COVID-19. The findings suggested that air pollution may be related to population vulnerability to COVID-19 infection, although the extent to which this relationship is confounded by city population density needs further exploration.},

This study used secondary data of meteorological and air pollutant parameters obtained from the Pollution Control Department of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment as well as daily confirmed COVID-19 case data in the BMR obtained from the official webpage of the Department of Disease Control, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand. We employed descriptive statistics, and Spearman and Kendall rank correlation tests were used to investigate the associations of weather variables, air pollutants, AQI with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. Our findings indicate that CO, NO2, SO2, O3 PM10, PM2.5, AQI have a significantly negative association with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in the BMR, whereas meteorological parameters such as temperature, relative humidity (RH), absolute humidity (AH) and wind speed (WS) showed significant positive associations with daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in the BMR. Our study is a useful supplement to encourage regulatory bodies to promote environmental strategies, as air pollution regulation could be a sustainable policy for mitigating the harmful effects of air pollutants. Furthermore, this study provides new insights into the relationship between daily meteorological factors, AQI, and air pollutants and daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in the BMR. These data may provide useful information to the public health authorities and decision makers in Thailand, as well as to the World Health Organization (WHO), in order to set proper strategic aimed at reducing the impact of the COVID-19.

abstract = {Introduction
Few studies have investigated the associations of child development with air pollution, land-use type, and maternal mental health simultaneously. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of exposure to air pollutants during several critical periods of life, with adjustment for land-use type and maternal mental status, on child development at 6, 12, and 24 months of age in the Greater Taipei area.
Methods
Participants were selected from an ongoing Taiwanese birth cohort study. We analyzed the data of the participants who had been recruited from January 2011 to April 2014. Self-administered standardized questionnaires were used to collect information on sociodemographic factors, infant development and health, maternal mental status, etc. Air pollution levels in pre- and postnatal periods were estimated using a spatial interpolation technique (ordinary kriging) at children's residential addresses. Land-use types around participants' homes were evaluated using buffer analysis. We used multiple logistic regression analysis to examine the relationships between child development delay and environmental factors.
Results
In total, 228, 361, and 441 families completed child development forms at 6, 12, and 24 months of age, respectively. Our results indicated that prenatal exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10 $\mu$m and O3 and postnatal exposure to NO2 were negatively associated with child development. Traffic-related land-use types, gas stations, and power generation areas around participants' homes were also adversely correlated with child development. Moreover, poor maternal mental health was associated with child development delay.
Conclusion
Prenatal exposure and postnatal exposure to air pollution were associated with development delay in children under 2 years of age, specifically those under 1 year of age, even after adjustment for land-use type and maternal mental status. Living environment is critical for the development of children under 2 years of age.},

Currently, there is still a lack of a full understanding of the factors determining the COVID-19 diffusion that clarify the causes of the variability of infections across different provinces and regions within countries. The main goal of this study is to explain new and main determinants underlying the diffusion of COVID-19 in society. This study focuses on international trade because this factor, in a globalized world, can synthetize different drivers of virus spread, such as mobility patterns, economic potentialities, and social interactions of an investigated areas. A case study research is performed on 107 provinces of Italy, one of the first countries to experience a rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths. Statistical analyses from March 2020 to February 2021 suggest that total import and export of provinces has a high association with confirmed cases over time (average r > 0.78, p-value <.001). Overall, then, this study suggests total import and export as complex indicator of COVID-19 transmission dynamics that outclasses other common parameters used to justify the COVID-19 spread, given by economic, demographic, environmental, and climate factors. In addition, this study proposes, for the first time, a time-dependent correlation analysis between trade data and COVID-19 infection cases to explain the relation between confirmed cases and social interactions that are a main source of the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent negative impact in society. These novel findings have main theoretical and practical implications directed to include a new parameter in modelling of the diffusion of COVID-19 pandemic to support effective policy responses of crisis management directed to constrain the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and similar infectious diseases in society.},

Smartphone technology offers an opportunity to address these challenges using large, multi-year datasets that capture individual symptoms and exposures in real time. We aimed to characterise associations between six pollen types and respiratory symptoms logged by users of the AirRater smartphone app in Tasmania, Australia. We analyzed 44,820 symptom reports logged by 2272 AirRater app users in Tasmania over four years (2015–2019). With these data we evaluated associations between daily respiratory symptoms and atmospheric pollen concentrations. We implemented Poisson regression models, using the case time series approach designed for app-sourced data. We assessed potentially non-linear and lagged associations with (a) total pollen and (b) six individual pollen taxa. We adjusted for seasonality and meteorology and tested for interactions with particulate air pollution (PM2.5). We found evidence of non-linear associations between total pollen and respiratory symptoms for up to three days following exposure. For total pollen, the same-day relative risk (RR) increased to 1.31 (95% CI: 1.26–1.37) at a concentration of 50 grains/m3 before plateauing. Associations with individual pollen taxa were also non-linear with some diversity in shapes. For all pollen taxa the same-day RR was highest. The interaction between total pollen and PM2.5 was positive, with risks associated with pollen significantly higher in the presence of high concentrations of PM2.5. Our results support a non-linear response between airborne pollen and respiratory symptoms. The association was strongest on the day of exposure and synergistic with particulate air pollution. The associations found with Dodonaea and Myrtaceae highlight the need to further investigate the role of Australian native pollen types in allergic respiratory disease.},

abstract = {Background: Evidence suggests that air pollution is associated with many adverse health outcomes such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), respiratory diseases, cancer, and birth defects. Yet few studies dig into the relationship between air pollution and airborne infectious diseases. Methods: Daily data on influenza incidence were obtained from Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC). Data on air pollutants including nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), ground-level ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), and PM with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 $\mu$m (PM10) were retrieved from ten national air sampling stations located at Wuhan. We applied generalized additive model (GAM) to estimate the associations between air pollution and the risk of influenza in Wuhan, China during 2015–2017. Results: In the single-day lag model, the largest effect estimates were observed at lag 0. An increased relative risk (RR) of influenza was significantly associated with a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in SO2 (RR: 1.099; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.011–1.195), NO2 (RR: 1.039; 95% CI: 1.013–1.065), and O3 (RR: 1.005; 95% CI: 0.994–1.016), respectively. In the multi-day lag model, concentrations of SO2, NO2, and O3 were statistically significantly associated with the risk of influenza at lag 0–1. The seasonal analysis suggests that the influence of air pollution on influenza is greater in the cold season as compared in the warm season in the early lag days. The multi-pollutant model indicates that NO2 may be a potential confounder for co-pollutants. Conclusions: Our study shows that air pollution may be associated with the risk of influenza in a broad sense. Therefore, when formulating policies to deal with influenza outbreaks in the future, factors regarding air pollution should be taken into consideration.},

abstract = {Objectives
Acute exposures to outdoor air pollution have been shown to reduce lung function in children with asthma, but the effect on adults with asthma has not been established in a meta-analysis. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of studies that assessed the relationship of outdoor air pollution and peak expiratory flow (PEF) in adults with asthma.
Methods
Studies that contained data on outdoor air pollution levels (PM10, PM2.5, or NO2) and PEF in adults with asthma were eligible for inclusion. Effect estimates were quantified for each air pollution measure using random effects models. Heterogeneity was investigated with the Q-test and I2 statistics. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were conducted to determine differences in effect by air pollution measures and the inclusion of smokers.
Results
A total of 22 effect estimates from 15 studies were included in this review. A 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in acute PM10 exposure was associated with a −0.19 L/min (95% CI: 0.30, −0.09) change in PEF. For both PM10 and PM2.5, the inclusion of current smokers was a significant source of heterogeneity among studies (meta-regression: p = 0.04 and p = 0.03). Among studies that only included non-smokers, a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in acute exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 was associated with changes in PEF of −0.25 L/min (95% CI: 0.38, −0.13) and −1.02 L/min (95% CI: 1.79, −0.24), respectively.
Conclusions
This study provides evidence that acute increases in PM10 and PM2.5 levels are associated with decreases in PEF in adults with asthma, particularly among non-smokers.},

abstract = {The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is generating a high number of infected individuals and deaths. One of the current questions is how climatological factors and environmental pollution can affect the diffusion of COVID-19 in human society. This study endeavours to explain the relation between wind speed, air pollution and the diffusion of COVID-19 to provide insights to constrain and/or prevent future pandemics and epidemics. The statistical analysis here focuses on case study of Italy and reveals two main findings: 1) cities with high wind speed have lower numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals; 2) cities located in hinterland zones (mostly those bordering large urban conurbations) with little wind speed and frequently high levels of air pollution had higher numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals. Results here suggest that high concentrations of air pollutants, associated with low wind speeds, may promote a longer permanence of viral particles in polluted air of cities, thus favouring an indirect means of diffusion of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), in addition to the direct diffusion with human-to-human transmission dynamics.},

abstract = {In the present study, we evaluated the effects of chronic exposure to traffic from a heavy-duty diesel-fueled vehicle area on respiratory symptoms and airway inflammation in a nonsmoking adult and elderly population. Respiratory symptoms were evaluated by the ISAAC questionnaire (International Study of Asthma and Allergies questionnaire), and airway inflammation was assessed by fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). Forty volunteers were selected from the 112 volunteers who completed the ISAAC questionnaire for the measurement of FeNO. The FeNO population comprised seven men (six aged ≥ 64 years old, four aged ≥ 75 years old) and 32 women (27 aged ≥ 64 years old, nine aged ≥ 75 years old). FeNO levels were tracked for six months, from November 2014 to June 2015. Results: Twenty-four percent of the volunteers reported having had wheezing in the chest in the last 12 months. However, only 2.7% of the volunteers reported doctor-diagnosed asthma. There was a positive association between FeNO and pollutants in most of the study months. An increase of 1 $\mu$g m−3 in NO2 was associated with a mean increase of 1.08 ppb in FeNO, and an increase of 1 $\mu$g m-3 in O3 was associated with a mean increase of 1.06 ppb in FeNO. The relative risk for NO2 ranged from 1.009 to 1.32 and that for O3 ranged from 1.014 to 1.020. Conclusion: The frequency of respiratory symptoms was much higher than the previously described levels of 6% in the Brazilian adult population. In summary, a high frequency of respiratory symptoms and high levels of FeNO were described in an underdiagnosed adult population living very close to a heavy-duty diesel-traffic area. Older elderly adults presented greater susceptibility to airway inflammation than younger adults.},

However, most studies failed to consider important cofounding factors in the estimation of health effects of air pollution. The objective of the study was to assess the short- and long-term effects of air pollution on the COVID-19 risk and fatality in Lombardy and Veneto. Air pollutants were studied based on monitoring station information in Lombardy and Veneto from January 2013 to May 2020. The daily number of cases and deaths of COVID-19 were collected from the reports of the Italian Ministry of Health in Italy. A generalized linear model with the generalized estimating equation method was used to evaluate the effects of short- and long-term exposure to air pollution on the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy and Veneto. After adjusting for other covariates, we found that short-term exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 had a tendency to increase the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 than long-term exposure, while for other air pollutants, including SO2 and NO2, long-term exposure was more significant than short-term exposure. Both short- and long-term exposure of SO2 resulted in increased health effects on COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings suggest that exposure to atmospheric pollution has a significant impact on COVID-19 pandemic and call for further researches to deeply investigate this topic.},

This study aimed to model the spatial-temporal of asthma in Tehran, Iran using a machine learning model. Initially, a spatial database was created consisting of 872 locations of asthma children and six air pollution parameters, including carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3) in four-seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter). Spatial-temporal modeling and mapping of asthma-prone areas were performed using a random forest (RF) model. For Spatio-temporal modeling and assessment, 70% and 30% of the dataset were used, respectively. The Spearman correlation and RF model findings showed that during different seasons, the PM2.5 parameter had the most important effect on asthma occurrence in Tehran. The assessment of the Spatio-temporal modeling of asthma using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-area under the curve (AUC) showed an accuracy of 0.823, 0.821, 0.83, and 0.827, respectively for spring, summer, autumn, and winter. According to the results, asthma occurs more often in autumn than in other seasons.},

abstract = {Background
Associations between early traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) exposure and respiratory and allergic morbidity in adolescents are inconsistent. However, sub-groups might be more vulnerable to the health effects of this exposure.
Objectives
We investigated associations between early exposure to TRAP and respiratory and allergic morbidity at age 13 years in the PARIS birth cohort, and potential modifying effects of sex, parental allergy, stressful family event and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI).
Methods
This study deals with data from 732 children of the PARIS birth cohort followed up using repeated questionnaires until 13 years of age. Prenatal TRAP exposure was assessed by measuring daily concentrations of nitrogen dioxide at the nearest station to mother's home. Early postnatal TRAP exposure was calculated for each child during the first year of life by a nitrogen oxides (NOx) air dispersion model taking into account both residence and daycare. Associations between TRAP exposures and asthma, rhinitis and related symptoms were assessed using multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounding factors. Effect modification was explored by testing multiplicative interactions.
Results
An increase in interquartile range (17.0 $\mu$g/m3) of early postnatal NOx exposure was positively related to current asthma (adjusted odds ratio aOR = 1.21; 95% confidence interval CI: 1.02, 1.43), severe wheeze (aOR = 1.23; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.47) and persistent asthma at 13 years old (aOR = 1.26; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.55) and tended to be associated with asthma ever. Parental history of allergy, asthma, early stressful family event and LRTI modified these associations with TRAP exposure. No relationship with rhinitis was found. Prenatal TRAP exposure did not show any association with respiratory and allergic morbidity.
Discussion
This study is one of the first to show several modifiers of the association between early postnatal TRAP exposure and asthma at adolescence. Not all adolescents seem equally affected by early postnatal TRAP exposure: those presenting parental history of allergy, especially asthma, those with early stressful family event or LRTI appear to be more vulnerable.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to particulate matter <2.5 $\mu$m in diameter (PM2.5) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) are associated with respiratory morbidity starting in utero. However, their potential synergistic effects have not been completely elucidated. Here, we examined the joint effects of prenatal and early life PM2.5 and prenatal ETS exposure on respiratory outcomes in children.
Material and methods
We studied 536 mother-child dyads in the Programming Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment and Social Stressors (PROGRESS) study in Mexico City. Exposure to PM2.5 was estimated using residence in pregnancy and child's first year of life with a satellite-based spatio-temporal model. ETS exposure was assessed by caregiver's report of any smoker in the household during the second or third trimester. Outcomes included report of ever wheeze and wheeze in the past 12 months (current wheeze) assessed when children were 6–8 years old considered in separate models. Associations were modeled using distributed lag models (DLM) with daily PM2.5 averages for pregnancy and the first year of life, adjusting for child's sex, birth weight z-score, mother's age and education at enrollment, maternal asthma, season of conception and stratified by prenatal ETS exposure (yes/no).
Results
We identified a sensitive window from gestational week 14 through postnatal week 18 during which PM2.5 was associated with higher risk of ever wheeze at age 6–8 years. We also observed a critical window of PM2.5 exposure between postnatal weeks 6–39 and higher risk of current wheeze. We found significant associations between higher prenatal and early life PM2.5 exposure and higher cumulative risk ratios of ever wheeze (RR:3.76, 95%CI [1.41, 10.0] per 5 $\mu$g/m3) and current wheeze in the past year (RR:7.91, 95%CI [1.5, 41.6] per 5 $\mu$g/m3) only among children born to mothers exposed to ETS in pregnancy when compared to mothers who were not exposed.
Conclusions
Exposure to prenatal ETS modified the association between prenatal and early life PM2.5 exposure and respiratory outcomes at age 6–8 years. It is important to consider concurrent chemical exposures to more comprehensively characterize children's environmental risk. Interventions aimed at decreasing passive smoking might mitigate the effects of ambient air pollution.},

abstract = {The number of studies published on COVID-19 in recent months is certainly impressive. However, there are still important gaps to know a great number of characteristics of this disease. Among these, some potential ways of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 and the different reasons for the severity of the disease in different people. Various studies have suggested that certain air pollutants could be increasing the transmission of the coronavirus, as well as the risks of COVID-19 incidence and mortality. In the present preliminary case-study conducted in Tarragona Province (Catalonia, Spain), we studied the potential association of COVID-19 with PM10, NO2 and O3, as well as the differences in the incidence and lethality of this disease. This Province is divided into two “health regions”: Camp de Tarragona, with an important industrial complex, and Terres de l'Ebre, with a great agricultural component. In spite of the notable limitations of the current study, our preliminary findings indicate that the industrialized/urban areas of Tarragona Province show a higher incidence and mortality of COVID-19 than the agricultural/rural zones. These – and previous – results would highlight the importance of conducting specific investigations focused on directly assessing whether air pollutants such as particulate matter can act as carriers of the SARS-CoV-2. If confirmed, the recommendation on keeping the “social distance” (1.5–2 m) might need to be adapted to this situation.},

The collective impact of environmental and ecosystem factors, as well as biodiversity, on the spread of COVID-19 and its mortality evolution remain empirically unknown, particularly in regions with a wide ecosystem range. The aim of our study is to assess how those factors impact on the COVID-19 spread and mortality by country. This study compiled a global database merging WHO daily case reports with other publicly available measures from January 21st to May 18th, 2020. We applied spatio-temporal models to identify the influence of biodiversity, temperature, and precipitation and fitted generalized linear mixed models to identify the effects of environmental variables. Additionally, we used count time series to characterize the association between COVID-19 spread and air quality factors. All analyses were adjusted by social demographic, country-income level, and government policy intervention confounders, among 160 countries, globally. Our results reveal a statistically meaningful association between COVID-19 infection and several factors of interest at country and city levels such as the national biodiversity index, air quality, and pollutants elements (PM10, PM2.5, and O3). Particularly, there is a significant relationship of loss of biodiversity, high level of air pollutants, and diminished air quality with COVID-19 infection spread and mortality. Our findings provide an empirical foundation for future studies on the relationship between air quality variables, a country's biodiversity, and COVID-19 transmission and mortality. The relationships measured in this study can be valuable when governments plan environmental and health policies, as alternative strategy to respond to new COVID-19 outbreaks and prevent future crises.},

However, the effects of PM2.5 components are poorly understood. This study aimed to use a longitudinal birth cohort of children with physician-diagnosed incident asthma to investigate the effect of PM2.5 components at birth on morbidity measured by health services utilization. Of 1277 Toronto Child Health Evaluation Questionnaire (T-CHEQ) participants, the study population included 362 children diagnosed with asthma who were followed for a mean of 13 years from birth until March 31, 2016, or loss-to-follow-up. Concentrations of PM2.5 and its components were assigned based on participants' postal codes at birth. Study outcomes included counts of asthma, asthma-related, and all-cause health services use. Poisson regression in single-, two-, and multi-pollutant models was used to estimate rate ratios (RR) per interquartile range (IQR) increase of exposures. Covariates were included in all models to further adjust for potential confounding. The adjusted RR for sulfate (SO4) and all-cause hospitalizations was statistically significant with RR = 2.23 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25–3.96) in a multi-pollutant model with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3). In multi-pollutant models with oxidants, the adjusted RRs for SO4 of all-cause hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits were also statistically significant with RR = 2.31 (95% CI: 1.32–4.03) and RR = 1.39 (95% CI: 1.02–1.90), respectively. While unadjusted single-pollutant RRs for asthma-specific and asthma-related health services use with the SO4 component of PM2.5 were above one, none were statistically significant. This study found significant associations with exposure to SO4 in PM2.5 and all-cause acute care, chiefly for hospitalizations, in children with asthma.},

abstract = {Background
Physical exercise in the presence of ambient air pollution may increase the absorbed dose of air pollutants. The combined effect of such exposure on cardiorespiratory function in young adults remains unclear.
Aim
To determine the acute cardiorespiratory responses in healthy young adults preforming submaximal physical exercise under exposure to high level winter-type ambient air pollution.
Methods
Healthy young males (n=30) performed two separate 15-minute submaximal exercise trials on a cycle ergometer – when air pollutants' concentrations were increased (exposure trial) and when air quality was good (control trial). Each time blood pressure, pulse oximetry, spirometry and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) were measured at baseline, directly after exercise and after 15-min of rest.
Results
High air pollutants concentrations were observed during exposure trials (PM2.5 24.0–157.0 $\mu$g/m3, SO2 8.7–85.8 $\mu$g/m3). Group-based correlation analysis showed statistically significant negative correlations between post-exercise declines in FEV1/FVC and SO2, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations. In individual cases the decrease was recorded only in subjects who exercised under particularly high exposure, and was not related to their BMI, physical activity pattern or allergy status. In multivariate analysis SO2 was a statistically significant predictor of both immediate (OR: 1.09, 95%CI: 1.01–1.17) and delayed decrease in airflow (OR: 1.08, 95%CI: 1.01–1.16), and PM2.5 was also a statistically significantly explanatory variable of post-exercise decline in FEV1/FVC (OR: 1.03, 95%CI: 1.00–1.06).
Conclusion
In young and healthy males exposure to ambient air pollution during short-term submaximal exercise is associated with a decrease in airflow (FEV1/FVC) and the decrease is more apparent when the exercise takes place under particularly high exposure conditions.},

abstract = {Ambient air pollution has been identified as one of the leading causes of global burden of disease. The relationship between ambient air pollution exposure and risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has stimulated increasing scientific interest in the past few years. However, evidence from human epidemiological studies is still limited and inconsistent. We performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the potential association comprehensively. Selected electronic databases were searched for related English language studies until March 1, 2020 with a final follow-up in December 31, 2020. Risk of bias assessment for individual studies were assessed using the OHAT (Office of Health Assessment and Translation) risk-of-bias rating tool. Confidence rating and level-of-evidence conclusions were developed for bodies of evidence for a given ambient air pollutant. Summary effect estimates were calculated using random-effects meta-analyses when three or more studies are identified for the same air pollutant–CKD combination. A total of 13 studies were finally identified in our study. The meta-analytic estimates (ORs) for risk of CKD were 1.15 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.24) for each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5, 1.25 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.40) for each 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM10, 1.10 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.17) for each 10 ppb increase in NO2, 1.06 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.15) for each 1 ppb increase in SO2 and 1.04 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.08) for each 0.1 ppm increase in CO, respectively. The level of evidence was appraised as moderate for four of the five tested air pollutant–CKD combinations using an adaptation of the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) tool. In conclusion, this study suggests that certain ambient air pollutant exposure was significantly associated with an increased risk of CKD. Given the limitations, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution, and further well-designed epidemiological studies are needed to draw a definite evidence of a causal relationship.},

However, whether long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with increased incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is controversial. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with a random-effects model to calculate the pooled risk estimates of COPD development per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in individual air pollutants. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched from the date of their inception to August 2019 to identify long-term (at least three years of observation) prospective longitudinal studies that reported the risk of COPD development due to exposure to air pollutants. The air pollutants studied included particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Results: Of the 436 studies identified, seven met our eligibility criteria. Among the seven studies, six, three, and five had data on PM2.5, PM10, and NO2, respectively. The meta-analysis results showed that a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 is associated with increased incidence of COPD (pooled HR 1.18, 95% CI 1.13–1.23). We also noted that a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in NO2 is marginally associated with increased incidence of COPD (pooled HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00–1.16). PM10 seems to have no significant impact on the incidence of COPD (pooled HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83–1.08), although the number of studies was too small. Meta-regression analysis found no significant effect modifiers. Conclusions: Long-term exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 can be associated with increased incidence of COPD.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to air pollution has been linked to individual health effects in occupational environments and communities proximate to air pollution sources. Use of estimated chemical concentrations from the Risk Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) model, derived from the Toxics Release Inventory, can help approximate some contributions to individual lifetime exposure to risk from air pollution and holds potential for linkages with specific health outcome data.
Objectives
Our objectives were: (1) use regression modeling to test for associations between observed blood metal concentrations in children and RSEI total air concentrations of the same metals released from proximate manufacturing facilities; (2) determine the relative contribution of RSEI air pollution to blood metal concentrations; and (3) examine associations between chronic metal exposure and cardiovascular functioning and structure in study participants.
Methods
Using data synthesis methods and regression modeling we linked individual blood-based levels of lead, mercury, and cadmium(Pb, Hg, Cd) and cardiovascular functioning and structure to proximate industrial releases of the same metals captured by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) RSEI geographic microdata.
Results
We found that RSEI-derived ground-level ambient air concentrations of Hg and Cd were a significant predictor of blood metal levels, when controlling for covariates and other exposure variables. In addition to associations with blood metal findings, RSEI concentrations also predicted cardiovascular dysfunction and risk including changes in left-ventricular mass, blood pressure, and heart rate.
Discussion
Right-to-know data, such as EPA's RSEI, can be linked to objective health outcomes, rather than simply serving as a non-specific risk estimate. These data can serve as a proxy for hazard exposure and should be used more widely to understand the dynamics of environmental exposure. Furthermore, since these data are both a product of and contribute to regulatory decision making, they could serve as an important link between disease risk and translation-orientated national environmental health policy.},

abstract = {Background
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is one of the major gaseous pollutants in China and other developing countries. Few multicity studies have been done to examine the short-term effect of SO2 on cause-specific years of life lost (YLL). This study was designed to investigate the burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) associated with SO2 exposure.
Methods
A 5-year time-series study was conducted in 48 Chinese cities from 2013 to 2017. Generalized additive models were first used to estimate the city-specific relationship. Then, random-effects meta-analyses were applied to pool the estimates. Furthermore, the roles of potential modifiers and the related economic loss estimated by the method of value per statistical life year were also evaluated.
Results
The annual mean concentration of SO2 was 27.1 $\mu$g/m3. A 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in 4-day moving average (lag03) of SO2 concentration was associated with 0.83% (95% CI: 0.13%, 1.53%) relative increment in YLL from COPD, and relevant percent change of mortality was 0.78% (95% CI: 0.16%, 1.41%). Moreover, a significantly higher effect was observed in the warm season, particularly in the south region. SO2 exposure was estimated to account for 1.89% of the total economic loss due to YLL from COPD.
Conclusions
Our findings showed a positive association between short-term exposure to SO2 and YLL from COPD and highlighted the importance of continuous control of SO2 pollution to reduce corresponding attributable disease burden.},

However, noise pollution is also a relevant environmental factor that contributes to the worsening of chronic cardiovascular diseases and even diabetes. This study analyzes the role of short-term noise pollution levels on the incidence and severity of cases of COVID-19 in Madrid from February 1 to May 31, 2020. The following variables were used in the study: daily noise levels averaged over 14 days; daily incidence rates, average cumulative incidence over 14 days; hospital admissions, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions and mortality due to COVID-19. We controlled for the effect of the pollutants PM10 and NO2 as well as for variables related to seasonality and autoregressive nature. GLM models with Poisson regressions were carried out using significant variable selection (p < 0.05) to calculate attributable RR. The results of the modeling using a single variable show that the levels of noise (leq24 h) were related to the incidence rate, the rate of hospital admissions, the ICU admissions and the rate of average cumulative incidence over 14 days. These associations presented lags, and the first association was with incidence (lag 7 and lag 10), then with hospital admissions (lag 17) and finally ICU admissions (lag 22). There was no association with deaths due to COVID-19. In the results of the models that included PM10, NO2, Leq24 h and the control variables simultaneously, we observed that only Leq24 h went on to become a part of the models using COVID-19 variables, including the 14-day average cumulative incidence. These results show that noise pollution is an important environmental variable that is relevant in relation to the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in the Province of Madrid.},

We comprehensively described air pollution during and after the lockdown periods in 2020 compared with 2018–2019, and estimated the mortality burden indicated by the number of deaths and years of life lost (YLL) related to the air pollution changes. The mean air quality index (AQI), PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2 and CO concentrations during the lockdown across China declined by 18.2 (21.2%), 27.0 $\mu$g/m3 (28.9%), 10.5 $\mu$g/m3 (18.3%), 8.4 $\mu$g/m3 (44.2%), 13.1 $\mu$g/m3 (38.8%), and 0.3 mg/m3 (27.3%) respectively, when compared to the same periods during 2018–2019. We observed an increase in O3 concentration during the lockdown by 5.5 $\mu$g/m3 (10.4%), and a slight decrease after the lockdown by 3.4 $\mu$g/m3 (4.4%). As a result, there were 51.3 (95%CI: 32.2, 70.1) thousand fewer premature deaths (16.2 thousand during and 35.1 thousand after the lockdown), and 1066.8 (95%CI: 668.7, 1456.8) thousand fewer YLLs (343.3 thousand during and 723.5 thousand after the lockdown) than these in 2018–2019. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 lockdown has caused substantial decreases in air pollutants except for O3, and that substantial human health benefits can be achieved when strict control measures for air pollution are taken to reduce emissions from vehicles and industries. Stricter tailored policy solutions of air pollution are urgently needed in China and other countries, especially in well-developed industrial regions, such as upgrading industry structure and promoting green transportation.},

abstract = {Background
The relationship between air pollution and meteorological factors on diseases has become a research hotspot recently. Nevertheless, few studies have touched the inferences of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and atmospheric pressure (AP) on hospitalization risk for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Objectives
To investigate the short-term impact of particulate air pollutants and meteorology factors on hospitalizations for COPD and quantify the corresponding risk burden of hospital admission.
Methods
In our study, COPD cases were collected from Guangzhou Panyu Central Hospital (n = 11,979) from Dec of 2013 to Jun 2019. The 24-h average temperature, relative humidity (RH), wind speed (V), AP and other meteorological data were obtained from Guangzhou Meteorological Bureau. Air pollution data were collected from Guangzhou Air Monitoring Station. The influence of different NO2 and AP values on COPD risk was quantified by a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM) combined with Poisson Regression and Time Series analysis.
Results
We found that NO2 had a non-linear relationship with the incidence of COPD, with an approximate “M" type, appearing at the peaks of 126 $\mu$g/m³ (RR = 1.32, 95%CI, 1.07 to 1.64) and 168 $\mu$g/m³ (RR = 1.21, 95%CI, 0.94 to 1.55), respectively. And the association between AP and COPD incidence exhibited an approximate J-shape with a peak occurring at 1035 hPa (RR = 1.16, 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.31).
Conclusions
The nonlinear relationship of NO2 and AP on COPD admission risk in different periods of lag can be used to establish an early warning system for diseases and reduce the possible outbreaks and burdens of COPD in a sensitive population.},

Lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are among the diseases associated with pollution that increase the mortality rate in Brazil and worldwide. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the impacts of air pollutants on mortality rates from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer (LC) using vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling. The adjusted model was a VAR(1) and, according to the Granger causality test, the air pollutants selected were PM10, O3, CO, NO2, and SO2. The shocks applied to the variables O3, using the impulse response function, negatively impacted COPD; in the eighth period, which is stabilized. The LC variable suffered more significant variations from O3 and after a shock in this variable, an initially negative response in LC occurred and the series stabilized in period nine. After one year, 20.19% of COPD variance was explained by O3. After twelve months, the atmospheric pollutant O3 represented 5.00% and NO2 represented 4.02% of LC variance. Moreover, the variables that caused the highest impact on COPD and LC mortality rates were O3 and NO2, indicating that air pollution influences the clinical state of people who have these diseases and even contributes to their development. The VAR model was able to identify the air pollutants that have the most significant impact on the diseases analyzed and explained the interrelationship between them.},

abstract = {Background
Exposure to ambient air pollution is related to 4.2 million premature deaths per year worldwide and is associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes, such as respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity. Furthermore, exposure to air pollution can increase human sensitivity to respiratory pathogens via damage to the respiratory tract or via airborne transmission on the surface of particulate matter, and might be an additional factor influencing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates. The aim of this study was to examine the association between populations' exposure to air pollution and the morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19.
Methods
We examined the association between population-weighted long-term exposure to PM2.5 and NOx, and the morbidity and mortality over time following the detection of the first COVID-19 positive case in 36 OECD countries. Pearson and Spearman correlations between daily COVID-19 morbidity and mortality (Jan–Jun 2020) on the 10th, 20th, 40th, 60th and 80th days since first confirmed case in the country, and demographic, health, economic, and environmental data were calculated. Multivariate linear regression were used to examine the associations between demographic, health, economic and air pollution features and the rate of confirmed cases and deaths on the 60th and 80th days following the first confirmed case.
Results
PM2.5 concentrations in 2015–2017 were positively correlated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality on the 10th, 20th, 40th and 60th days since the first confirmed case in all countries. NOx concentrations in 2015–2017 and country's density (population/Km2) were positively correlated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality on the 60th day. All multivariate linear regressions consisting PM2.5 concentrations models were statistically significant. Our models also emphasize the importance of the relative number of hospital beds in decreasing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.
Conclusions
The adverse health outcomes stemming from long-term exposure to various air pollutants has long been known to the scientific community. According to our results and previously published studies, it appears that long-term exposure to air pollutants concentrations exceeding WHO guidelines, such as PM2.5 and NOx, might exacerbate morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19. These results should raise a red flag globally among decision makers about the urgent need to reduce air pollution and its harmful effects.},

We carried out an ecological study to assess the association between long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality after accounting for demographic, socioeconomic and meteorological variables. The study was based on publicly available data. Multivariable negative binomial mixed regression models were fitted, and results were reported in terms of incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMR). The effect of winter temperature and humidity was modelled through restricted cubic spline. Data from 1439 municipalities out of 1507 (95%) were included in the analyses, leading to a total of 61,377 COVID-19 cases and 40,401 deaths from all-causes collected from February 20th to April 16th and from March 1st to April 30th, 2020, respectively. Several demographic and socioeconomic variables resulted significantly associated with COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality in a multivariable fashion. An increase in average winter temperature was associated with a nonlinear decrease in COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality, while an opposite trend emerged for the absolute humidity. An increase of 10 $\mu$g/m3 in the mean annual concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 over the previous years was associated with a 58% and 34% increase in COVID-19 incidence rate, respectively. Similarly, a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase of annual mean PM2.5 concentration was associated with a 23% increase in all-cause mortality. An inverse association was found between NO2 levels and COVID-19 incidence and all-cause mortality. Our ecological study showed that exposure to PM was significantly associated with the COVID-19 incidence and excess mortality during the first wave of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy.},

In addition to mass concentration, other measurement metrics are needed to connect particle pollution data and health effects. In our measurements made in traffic-influenced environments in Helsinki, Finland (a relatively clean city), and Delhi-National Capital Region (Delhi-NCR), India (a polluted area), we noted a large difference in the median particle size for lung-deposited surface area (LDSA). In Helsinki, the median size was 80 nm, corresponding to soot particles emitted from diesel engines. However, the median size increased to 190 nm during a long-range transport event of air mass. In Delhi-NCR, surprisingly, the median size was even larger, 410 nm. These larger particles were likely to originate from regional sources rather than local traffic. The LDSA to PM2.5 ratio for particles in Helsinki was 2–4 times the amount in Delhi-NCR, potentially linked with the higher toxicity of a unit of particulate mass in Helsinki.},

This study aimed to estimate the differential effects of three size-specific PM on hospitalizations of children aged <18 years for pneumonia and bronchitis in 18 cities of southwestern China. The city-specific association was firstly estimated using the over-dispersed generalized additive model and then combined to obtain the regional average association. Further, to evaluate the robustness of the key findings, subgroup analyses and co-pollutant models were constructed. PM-related risks of LRI differed by PM fractions and cause-specific LRI. A 10 $\mu$g/m3 increment in PM2.5_lag03, PM10_lag06, and PMC_lag06 was associated with a 0.79% (95% CI: 0.29%, 1.29%), 0.77% (95% CI: 0.13%, 1.41%), and 2.33% (95% CI: 1.23%, 3.44%) increase in children's LRI hospitalizations, respectively. After adjustment for gaseous pollutants, adverse effects of the three types of size-specific PM on pneumonia hospitalizations were stable, ranging from 0.29% (95% CI: 0.05%, 0.54%) for PM2.5–2.50% (95% CI: 1.38%, 3.64%) for PMC. Additionally, PMC-related risk of bronchitis hospitalizations remained stable after adjustment for gaseous pollutants. Associations of pneumonia with PMC and PM10 in infants, bronchitis with PM2.5 in children aged 6–17 years, pneumonia and bronchitis with PM2.5, PMC, and PM10 in children aged 1–5 years were all statistical significant. Specifically, the effects of PM2.5 on LRI hospitalizations increased by age, with the highest effect of 1.72% (95%CI: 1.01%, 2.43%) in children aged 6–17 years. Our study provided evidence for short-term effects of different PM fractions on children LRI hospitalizations in Southwestern China, which will be useful for making and promoting policies on air quality standards in order to protect children's health.},

This pandemic compelled countries to enforce a socio-economic lockdown to prevent its widespread. This paper focuses on how the particulate matter pollution was reduced during the lockdown period (23 March to April 15, 2020) as compared to before lockdown. Both ground-based and satellite observations were used to identify the improvement in air quality of Pakistan with primary focus on four major cities of Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Peshawar. Both datasets have shown a substantial reduction in PM2.5 pollution levels (ranging from 13% to 33% in case of satellite observations, while 23%–58% in ground-based observations) across Pakistan. Result shows a higher rate of COVID-19 spread in major cities of Pakistan with poor air quality conditions. Yet more research is needed in order to establish linkage between COVID-19 spread and air pollution. However, it can be partially attributed to both higher rate of population density and frequent exposure of population to enhanced levels of PM2.5 concentrations before lockdown period.},

abstract = {Epidemiologic studies have used aerosol optical depth (AOD)-PM2.5 as a proxy for ambient PM2.5 in urban and rural areas, even though its validation with air monitors has only occurred in urban areas. The contribution of elevated AOD-PM2.5 on respiratory-cardiovascular true positive (TP) cases, exposed to high PM2.5, and true negative (TN) controls, not exposed to elevated PM2.5, was evaluated in 72 Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) grids with (urban) and without (rural) air monitors. The odds ratio (OR) algorithm and the newly developed beta (ẞ) algorithm were used to evaluate the reliability and validity of TP cases, and TN controls in grids with and without air monitors. Four experimental AOD-PM2.5 fused surfaces and four health outcomes were evaluated. Only the linear predictor (ẞ) algorithm reliably and correctly identified TP cases and TN controls, with probabilities $\sim$1.00. The OR algorithm only identified TN controls, with probabilities $\sim$1.00, and significantly overestimated the percentage of TP cases. Regression analyses demonstrated that the OR algorithm's accuracy could be improved if the number of cases for all health outcomes was increased 50.8% in all grids and 73.9% in grids without monitors. Since the number and percentage of TP cases and TN controls were similar in grids with and without air monitors, this outcome suggests that the AOD-PM2.5 and health outcome concentration-response function evaluated in grids with monitors also holds in grids without air monitors. The possible use of AOD-PM2.5 fused surfaces, as another epidemiologic tool, to assess elevated ambient PM2.5 concentration levels to respiratory-cardiovascular hospital events in rural areas is discussed.},

To control the rapid spreading of the COVID-19 virus, the government of India imposed lockdown policies, which creates a unique opportunity to analyze the impact of lockdown on air quality in the two most populous cities of India, i.e., Delhi and Mumbai. To do this, the study employed a spatial approach to examine the concentration of seven criteria pollutants, i.e., PM2.5, PM10, NH3, CO, NO2, O3, and SO2, before, during, and after a lockdown in Delhi and Mumbai. Overall, around 42%, 50%, 21%, 37%, 53%, and 41% declines in PM2.5, PM10, NH3, CO, NO2, and SO2 were observed during the lockdown period as compared to previous years. On the other hand, a 2% increase in O3 concentration was observed. However, the study analyzed the National Air Quality Index (NAQI) for Delhi and Mumbai and found that lockdown does not improve the air quality in the long term period. Our key findings provide essential information to the cities' administration to develop rules and regulations to enhance air quality.},

abstract = {Little is known on respiratory effects of indoor chemicals in the tropics. We investigated associations between asthma and respiratory infections in Malaysian students and chemical exposure at home and at school. Moreover, we investigated differences in home environment between the three main ethnic groups in Malaysia (Malay, Chinese, Indian). Totally, 462 students from 8 junior high schools in Johor Bahru participated (96% participation rate). The students answered a questionnaire on health and home environment. Climate, carbon dioxide (CO2), volatile organic compounds (VOC), formaldehyde and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were measured inside and outside the schools. Multilevel logistic regression was applied to study associations between exposure and health. Totally 4.8% were smokers, 10.3% had wheeze, 9.3% current asthma, and had 18.8% any respiratory infection in the past 3 months. Malay students had more dampness or mould (p < 0.001), more environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) (p < 0.001) and more cats (p < 0.001) at home as compared to Chinese or Indian students. Wheeze was associated with ethnicity (p = 0.02; lower in Indian), atopy (p = 0.002), current smoking (p = 0.02) and recent indoor painting at home (p = 0.03). Current asthma was associated with ethnicity (p = 0.001; lower in Chinese) and para-dichlorobenzene in classroom air (p = 0.008). Respiratory infections were related to atopy (p = 0.002), ethylbenzene (p = 0.02) and para-dichlorobenzene (p = 0.01) in classroom air. Para-dichlorobenzene is used in Asia against insects. In conclusion, chemical emissions from recent indoor painting at home can increase the risk of wheeze. In schools, para-dichlorobenzene can increase the risk of current asthma and respiratory infections while ethylbenzene can increase the risk of respiratory infections.},

abstract = {New York City (NYC) experienced a sharp decline in air pollution during the COVID-19 shutdown period (March 15, 2020 to May 15, 2020)—albeit at high social and economic costs. It provided a unique opportunity to simulate a scenario in which the city-wide air quality improvement during the shutdown were sustained over the five-year period, 2021 through 2025, allowing us to estimate the potential public health benefits to children and adults and their associated economic benefits. We focused on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and modeled potential future health benefits to children and adults. The analysis considered outcomes in children that have not generally been accounted for in clean air benefits assessments, including preterm birth, term low birthweight, infant mortality, child asthma incidence, child asthma hospital admissions and emergency department visits, autism spectrum disorder, as well as adult mortality. We estimated a city-wide 23% improvement in PM2.5 levels during the COVID-19 shutdown months compared to the average level for those months in 2015–2018 (the business as usual period). Based on the data for 2020, we extrapolated the ambient levels of PM2.5 for the following five-year period. The estimated cumulative benefits for 2021–2025 included thousands of avoided cases of illness and death, with associated economic benefits from 31.8 billion to 77 billion. This “natural experiment,” tragic though the cause, has provided a hypothetical clean air scenario that can be considered aspirational—one that could be achieved through transportation, climate, and environmental policies that support robust economic recovery with similarly reduced emissions.},

However, the magnitude of this association in South Asia and sources of PM2.5 that drive adverse health effects are largely unknown. This study evaluates associations between short-term variation in ambient PM2.5 and incidence of pneumonia and upper respiratory infections among children in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We also perform an exploratory analysis of the PM2.5 source composition that is most strongly associated with health endpoints. We leveraged data from health surveillance of children less than five years of age between 2005 and 2014 in Kamalapur, Bangladesh, including daily physician-confirmed diagnoses of pneumonia and upper respiratory infection. Twice-weekly source-apportioned ambient PM2.5 measurements were obtained for the same period, and Poisson regression adjusted for time-varying covariates was used to estimate lagged associations between ambient PM2.5 and respiratory infection. We use complementary matching and stratification approaches to evaluate whether these associations vary across PM2.5 source composition. Total PM2.5 mass was associated with a modest increase in incidence of pneumonia, with a peak effect size two days after exposure (rate ratio = 1.032; 95% confidence interval = 1.008–1.056). We did not identify a significant association between PM2.5 and upper respiratory infection. Stratified and matching analyses suggested this association was stronger among days when ambient PM2.5 had a higher mass percent associated with brick kiln and fugitive lead emissions.: This study suggests that elevated ambient PM2.5 contributes to increased incidence of child pneumonia in urban Dhaka, and that this relationship varies among days with different source composition of PM2.5.},

This study aimed to evaluate the risk of cause-specific AURI and ALRI, in children within 24 h of exposure to air pollution. We obtained data on emergency cases, including 11,091 AURI cases (acute pharyngitis, acute tonsillitis, acute obstructive laryngitis and epiglottitis, and unspecified acute upper respiratory infections) and 11,401 ALRI cases (pneumonia, acute bronchitis, acute bronchiolitis, unspecified acute lower respiratory infection) in Brisbane, Australia, 2013–2015. A time-stratified case-crossover analysis was used to examine the hourly association of AURI and ALRI with high concentration (95th percentile) of four air pollutants (particulate matters with aerodynamic diameter <10 $\mu$m (PM10) and <2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2)). We observed increased risk of acute tonsillitis associated with PM2.5 within 13–24 h (odds ratio (OR), 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–2.06) and increased risk of unspecified acute upper respiratory infections related to O3 within 2–6 h (OR, 1.38, 95%CI, 1.12–1.70), NO2 within 1 h (OR, 1.19; 95%CI, 1.01–1.40), and PM2.5 within 7–12 h (OR, 1.21; 95%CI, 1.02–1.43). Cold season and nigh-time air pollution has greater effects on AURI, whereas greater risk of ALRI was seen in warm season and daytime. Our findings suggest exposures to particulate and gaseous air pollution may transiently increase risk of AURI and ALRI in children within 24 h. Prevention measures aimed at protecting children's respiratory health should consider the very acute effects of air pollution.},

In order to evaluate the changes of airway inflammation and pulmonary functions in the elderly in response to individual exposure of particles (PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10), we analyzed 43 elderly subjects with either asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or Asthma COPD Overlap (ACO) and 40 age-matched subjects without asthma nor COPD in an urban community in Shanghai, China. Data were collected at the baseline and in 6 follow-ups from August 2016 to December 2018, once every 3 months except for the last twice with a 6-month interval. In each follow-up, pulmonary functions, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), 7-day continuous personal exposure to airborne particles were measured. Multivariate linear mixed effect regression models were applied to investigate the quantitative changes of pulmonary functions and FeNO in two respective groups. The results showed that on average 4.7 follow-up visits were completed in each participant. In subjects with CRDs, an inter-quartile range (IQR) increase of personal exposure to PM1.0, PM2.5 and PM10 was significantly associated with an average increase of FeNO(Lag1) of 6.7 ppb (95%CI 1.2, 9.9 ppb), 6.2 ppb (95%CI 1.5, 12.0 ppb) and 5.6 ppb (95%CI 1.5, 11.0 ppb), respectively, and an average decrease of FEV1(Lag2) of −3.6 L (95%CI -6.0, −1.1 L), −3.6 L (95%CI -6.4, −0.8 L) and −3.2 L (95%CI -5.8, −0.6 L), respectively, in the single-pollutant model. These associations remained consistent in the two-pollutant models adjusting for gaseous air pollutants. Stratified analysis showed that subjects with lower BMI, females and non-allergies were more sensitive to particle exposure. No robust significant effects were observed in the subjects without CRDs. Our study provided data on the susceptibility of the elderly with CRDs to particle exposure of PM1.0 and PM2.5, and the modification effects by BMI, gender and history of allergies.},

The concentration of NO2 linked to COVID-19-related deaths in three major French cities were determined using Artificial Neural Networks experiments and a Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential effects of NO2 in spreading the epidemic. The underlying hypothesis is that NO2, as a precursor to secondary particulate matter formation, can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection. Three different neural networks for the cities of Paris, Lyon and Marseille were built in this work, followed by the application of an innovative tool of cutting the signal from the inputs to the selected target. The results show that the threshold levels of NO2 connected to COVID-19 range between 15.8 $\mu$g/m3 for Lyon, 21.8 $\mu$g/m3 for Marseille and 22.9 $\mu$g/m3 for Paris, which were significantly lower than the average annual concentration limit of 40 $\mu$g/m³ imposed by Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament.},

Recent studies suggest that the mortality rate of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) in the U.S. is decreasing. However, the mortality trends and demographic differences of PF among the states have not been evaluated.
Objective
To evaluate PF-related mortality rates and trends in the nine most populated states in the U.S.
Methods
Population-based study using the Multiple Cause of Death Database available through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. PF-related deaths were identified using ICD codes.
Results
From 2004 to 2018, average annual mortality rates ranged from being the lowest in New York (110.8 per 1,000,000) to the highest in North Carolina (195.3 per 1,000,000). The mortality rates showed a decline in the majority of the states and were stable in the other states. The most significant declines were in California and Michigan. The average mortality rates in males were higher than females in all the states (rate ratio ranged from 1.56 in Texas to 1.81 in New York) and the decline in the mortality rates was more pronounced compared to males in most states. The mortality rates in Blacks were lower compared to Whites in all the states (rate ratio ranged from 0.47 in New York to 0.69 in Ohio) and the decline in the mortality rates over the period was more significant than in Whites.
Conclusions
There is substantial variation in mortality rates and mortality trends between states and different demographics. Further studies are needed to evaluate the environmental factors, diagnostic accuracy, and coding practices contributing to these differences.},

abstract = {This study aims to find the association between short-term exposure to air pollutants, such as particulate matters and ground-level ozone, and SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases. Generalized linear models (GLM), a typical choice for ecological modeling, have well-established limitations. These limitations include apriori assumptions, inability to handle multicollinearity, and considering differential effects as the fixed effect. We propose an Ensemble-based Dynamic Emission Model (EDEM) to address these limitations. EDEM is developed at the intersection of network science and ensemble learning, i.e., a specialized approach of machine learning. Generalized Additive Model (GAM), i.e., a variant of GLM, and EDEM are tested in Los Angeles and Ventura counties of California, which is one of the biggest SARS-CoV-2 clusters in the US. GAM depicts that a 1 $\mu$g/m3, 1 $\mu$g/m3, and 1 ppm increase (lag 0–7) in PM 2.5, PM 10, and O3 is associated with 4.51% (CI: 7.01 to −2.00) decrease, 1.62% (CI: 2.23 to −1.022) decrease, and 4.66% (CI: 0.85 to 8.47) increase in daily SARS-CoV-2 cases, respectively. Subsequent increment in lag resulted in the negative association between pollutants and SARS-CoV-2 cases. EDEM results in an R2 score of 90.96% and 79.16% on training and testing datasets, respectively. EDEM confirmed the negative association between particulates and SARS-CoV-2 cases; whereas, the O3 depicts a positive association; however, the positive association observed through GAM is not statistically significant. In addition, the county-level analysis of pollutant concentration interactions suggests that increased emissions from other counties positively affect SARS-CoV-2 cases in adjoining counties as well. The results reiterate the significance of uniformly adhering to air pollution mitigation strategies, especially related to ground-level ozone.},

This study evaluates the global impact of lockdowns on air pollutants using tropospheric and ground-level indicators over a five-month period. Moreover, the relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 cases and mortalities was examined. Changes in the global tropospheric (NO2, aerosols, and O3) and ground-level (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3) pollutants were observed, and the maximum air quality improvement was observed immediately after lockdown. Except for a few countries, a decline in air pollutants correlated with a reduction in Land Surface Temperature (LST). Notably, regions with higher tropospheric NO2 and aerosol concentrations were also COVID-19 hotspots. Our analysis showed moderate positive correlation for NO2 with COVID-19 cases (R2 = 0.33; r = 0.57, P = 0.006) and mortalities (R2 = 0.40; r = 0.63, P = 0.015), while O3 showed a weak-moderate positive correlation with COVID-19 cases (R2 = 0.22; r = 0.47, P = 0.003) and mortalities (R2 = 0.12; r = 0.35, P = 0.012). However, PM2.5, and PM10 showed no significant correlation with either COVID-19 cases or mortality.

Several aspects of the association between exposure to air pollution and risk of lung cancer remain unclear.
Objective
We aimed at performing a meta-analysis of high-quality cohort studies on exposure to particulate matter (PM) 10 and PM2.5 and risk of lung cancer.
Methods
We identified cohort studies published since 2004, that reported risk estimates of lung cancer for exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 adjusted for tobacco smoking and socioeconomic status, and conducted a meta-analysis based on random-effects models, including stratification by outcome, sex, country, tobacco smoking, and age.
Results
Results on PM2.5 exposure were available from 15 studies; the summary relative risk (RR) for an increase of 10 $\mu$g/m3 was 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09, 1.23). The corresponding RR for PM10 exposure was 1.23 (95 CI 1.05, 1.40; seven studies). A higher risk was suggested in studies based on lung cancer mortality and in studies conducted in East Asia, while no difference was shown according to sex, smoking status or age. There was no suggestion of publication bias.
Conclusions
Our meta-analysis supported the hypothesis of an association between exposure to PM2.5 or PM10 and risk of lung cancer, and provided evidence that the magnitude of the risk might be higher than previously estimated, and might be modified by outcome and geographic region.},

The effect of exposure to particulate matter (PM) on human health is a global public health concern. To develop an effective strategy to reduce PM exposure, we performed detailed questionnaire surveys regarding the type of lifestyle required to avoid PM exposure in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We correlated the data with real-time PM concentration during the winter season.
Methods
We enrolled 104 patients with COPD aged 40 years or older. Detailed questionnaire surveys were conducted among participants, and internet of things-based sensors were installed at their homes to measure the indoor PM2.5 concentration, which was continuously monitored between December 2019 and February 2020. The associations among PM2.5 concentration, patients' lifestyles, and the impact of both concentration and lifestyle on COPD exacerbation were analyzed.

Mean outdoor PM2.5 concentration was higher than mean indoor PM2.5 concentration during the study period (21.28 ± 5.09 $\mu$g/m3 vs. 12.75 ± 7.64 $\mu$g/m3), with a mean difference of 8.53 ± 7.99 $\mu$g/m3. Among the various social factors and practices that aim to avoid exposure to PM, six practices and economic statuses were confirmed to reduce indoor PM2.5 concentration compared to outdoor concentration; Contrarily, these practices created a significant difference between the outdoor and indoor PM2.5 concentrations. The six practice items that showed a significant difference were 1) checking air quality forecast (the difference: −13.31 ± 1.35 $\mu$g/m3, p = 0.013), 2) indoor air filter operated (−15.43 ± 1.32 $\mu$g/m3, p < 0.001), 3) ventilating home by opening the windows (−13.14 ± 1.28 $\mu$g/m3, p = 0.013), 4) checking filters of the air filter (−13.95 ± 1.50 $\mu$g/m3, p = 0.002), 5) refraining from going out when outside PM is high (−12.52 ± 1.37 $\mu$g/m3, p = 0.039), 6) wearing a mask when going out (−13.38 ± 1.32 $\mu$g/m3, p = 0.017). The higher the household income and economic level, the more significant the difference in the PM2.5 concentration. Severe exacerbation was more prevalent among patients with acute exacerbation as the exposure time of PM2.5≥35 $\mu$g/m3 or PM2.5≥75 $\mu$g/m3.
Conclusion
Lifestyle and economic levels can affect the indoor PM2.5 concentration, which may impact COPD exacerbation.},

abstract = {Background
Recent studies conducted in several OECD countries have shown that chronic exposure to elevated levels of air pollutants (especially PM2.5, PM10 and NOx), might negatively impact COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates. The aim of this study was to examine the association between chronic exposure to air pollution in Israeli cities and towns, their demographic and socioeconomic status, and COVID-19 morbidity, during the three local morbidity waves.
Methods
We examined the associations between: (a) annual average concentrations of NOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5 and SO2 in 2016–2019, and demographic and socioeconomic parameters, and (b) COVID-19 positive cases in 279 Israeli cities and towns, in the four state-wide morbidity peaks: 1st wave peak: March 31st, 2020; 2nd wave peaks: July 24th and September 27th, 2020, and the 3rd wave peak: January 17th, 2021, which occurred after the beginning of the nationwide vaccination campaign. These associations were calculated using both Spearman correlations and multivariate linear regressions.
Results
We found statistically significant positive correlations between the concentrations of most pollutants in 2016–19 and COVID-19 morbidity rate at the first three timepoints but not the 4th (January 17th, 2021). Population density and city/town total population were also positively associated with the COVID-19 morbidity rates at these three timepoints, but not the 4th, in which socioeconomic parameters were more dominant - we found a statistically significant negative correlation between socioeconomic cluster and COVID-19 morbidity. In addition, all multivariate models including PM2.5 concentrations were statistically significant, and PM2.5 concentrations were positively associated with the COVID-19 morbidity rates in all models.
Conclusions
We found a nationwide association between population chronic exposure to five main air pollutants in Israeli cities and towns, and COVID-19 morbidity rates during two of the three morbidity waves experienced in Israel. The widespread morbidity that was related to socioeconomic factors during the 3rd wave, emphasizes the need for special attention to morbidity prevention in socioeconomically vulnerable populations and especially in large household communities. Nevertheless, this ecological study has several limitations, such as the inability to draw conclusions about causality or mechanisms of action. The growing body of evidence, regarding association between exacerbated COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates and long-term chronic exposure to elevated concentrations of air pollutants should serve as a wake-up call to policy makers regarding the urgent need to reduce air pollution and its harmful effects.},

abstract = {PM2.5 (particulate matter ≤2.5 $\mu$m in aerodynamic diameter) is a major urban air pollutant worldwide. Its effects on the respiratory system of the susceptible population have been less characterized. This study aimed to estimate the association of short-term PM2.5 exposure with respiratory outcomes of the retired adults, and to examine whether these associations were stronger among the subjects with GSTT-null genotype. 32 healthy subjects (55–77 years) were recruited for five follow-up examinations. Ambient concentrations of PM2.5 were monitored consecutively for 7 days prior to physical examination. Pulmonary outcomes including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and nasal fluid concentrations of 8-epi-prostaglandin F2 alpha (8-epi-PGF2$\alpha$), tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and IL-1$\beta$ were measured. A linear mixed-effect model was introduced to evaluate the associations of PM2.5 concentrations with respiratory outcomes. Additionally, GSTT1 genotype-based stratification was performed to characterize modification on PM2.5-related respiratory outcomes. We found that a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with decreases of 0.52 L (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.04, -0.002), 0.64 L (95% CI: -1.13, -0.16), 0.1 (95% CI: -0.23, 0.04) and 2.87 L/s (95% CI: -5.09, -0.64) in FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio and PEF at lag 2, respectively. Meanwhile, marked increases of 80.82% (95% CI: 5.13%, 156.50%) in IL-8, 77.14% (95% CI: 1.88%, 152.40%) in IL-1$\beta$ and 67.87% (95% CI: 14.85%, 120.88%) in 8-epi-PGF2$\alpha$ were observed as PM2.5 concentration increased by 10 $\mu$g/m3 at lag 2. Notably, PM2.5-associated decreases in FVC and PEF and increase in FeNO were stronger among the subjects with GSTT1-null genotype. In summary, short-term exposure to PM2.5 is associated with nasal inflammation, oxidative stress and lung function reduction in the retired subjects. Lung function reduction and inflammation are stronger among the subjects with GSTT1-null genotype.},

abstract = {Background
Low income, a known prognostic indicator of various chronic respiratory diseases, has not been properly studied in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We hypothesize that a low income has an adverse prognostic impact on IPF.
Methods
Patients were selected from the French national prospective cohort COFI. Patients' income was assessed through the median city-level income provided by the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies according to their residential address. Patients were classified in two groups as “low income” vs. “higher income” depending on whether their annual income was estimated to be < or ≥18 170 €/year (the first quartile of the income distribution in the study population). The survival and progression-free survival (PFS) of the groups were compared by a log-rank test and a Cox model in multivariate analysis.
Results
200 patients were included. The average follow-up was 33.8 ± 22.7 months. Patients in the low income group were significantly more likely to be of non-European origin (p < 0.006), and to have at least one occupational exposure (p < 0.0001), and they tended to have a higher cumulative exposure to fine particles PM2.5 (p = 0.057). After adjusting for age, gender, forced vital capacity at inclusion, geographical origin, and occupational exposure having a low-income level was a factor associated with a worse PFS (HR: 1.81; CI95%: 1.24–2.62, p = 0.001) and overall survival (HR: 1.49; CI95%: 1.0006–2.23, p = 0.049).
Conclusions
Low income appears to be a prognostic factor in IPF. IPF patients with low incomes may also be exposed more frequently to occupational exposures.},

abstract = {Background
The cardiopulmonary effects of chemical constituents and sources of indoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) remain unclear.
Objectives
To examine the individual and joint effects of constituents of indoor PM2.5 on cardiopulmonary function of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the role of identified sources.
Methods
This panel study recruited 43 stable COPD patients from November 2015 to May 2016 in Beijing, China. Daily indoor and outdoor PM2.5 were collected for five consecutive days simultaneously. Twenty-four elements were measured and principal component analysis was used for source appointment. Pulmonary function and blood pressure (BP) were also measured at daily visit. The linear mixed-effect models were used to estimate the effect of each constituent and source. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models were used to estimate the overall effect of all measured constituents.
Results
The combustion, indoor soil/dust and road dust sources were identified as the main sources of indoor PM2.5 and combustion sources contributed over 40% during the heating season. Most constituents were significantly associated with elevated BP of COPD patients and the joint effects of mixed exposures were also significant especially during the heating season. Most associations of chemical constituents with pulmonary function were negative but not statistically significant during the heating season, as was the joint effect. Few associations were observed during the non-heating season. Further, we observed combustion sources throughout the study period and road dust sources during the heating season were significantly associated with increased BP but not decreased pulmonary function.
Conclusion
The combustion and road dust sources and their related constituents of indoor PM2.5 could cause adverse effects on cardiovascular function of COPD patients especially during the heating season, but the effect on pulmonary function still needs to be further studied.},

abstract = {The present work aims to study the role of air pollutants in relation to the number of deaths per each Italian province affected by COVID-19. To do that, specific mortality from COVID-19 has been standardized for each Italian province and per age group (10 groups) ranging from 0 to 9 years to >90 years, based on the 2019 national population figures. The link between air pollutants and COVID-19 mortality among Italian provinces was studied implementing a linear regression model, whereas the wide set of variables were examined by means of LISA (Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation), relating the spatial component of COVID-19 related data with a mix of environmental variables as explanatory variables. As results, in some provinces, namely the Western Po Valley provinces, the SMR (Standardized Mortality Ratio) is much higher than expected, and the presence of PM10 was independently associated with the case status. Furthermore, the results for LISA on SMR and PM10 demonstrate clusters of high-high values in the wide Metropolitan area of Milan and the Po Valley area respectively, with a certain level of overlap of the two distributions in the area strictly considered Milan. In conclusion, this research appears to find elements to confirm the existence of a link between pollution and the risk of death due to the disease, in particular, considering land take and air pollution, this latter referred to particulate (PM10). For this reason, we can reiterate the need to act in favour of policies aimed at reducing pollutants in the atmosphere, by means of speeding up the already existing plans and policies, targeting all sources of atmospheric pollution: industries, home heating and traffic.},

abstract = {Public health authorities have been paramount in guaranteeing that adequate fresh air ventilation is promoted in classrooms to avoid SARS-CoV-2 transmission in educational environments. In this work it was aimed to assess ventilation conditions (carbon dioxide, CO2) and suspended particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10 and UFP) levels in 19 classrooms – including preschool, primary and secondary education – located in the metropolitan area of Ciudad Real, Central-Southern Spain, during the school's reopening (from September 30th until October 27th, 2020) after about 7 months of lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic. The classrooms that presented the worst indoor environmental conditions, according to the highest peak of concentration obtained, were particularly explored to identify the possible influencing factors and respective opportunities for improvement. Briefly, findings suggested that although ventilation promoted through opening windows and doors according to official recommendations is guaranteeing adequate ventilation conditions in most of the studied classrooms, thus minimizing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission, a total of 5 (26%) surveyed classrooms were found to exceed the recommended CO2 concentration limit value (700 ppm). In general, preschool rooms were the educational environments that registered better ventilation conditions, while secondary classrooms exhibited the highest peak and average CO2 concentrations. In turn, for PM2.5, PM10 and UFP, the concentrations assessed in preschools were, on average about 2-fold greater than the levels obtained in both primary and secondary classrooms. In fact, the indoor PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations substantially exceeded the recommended limits of 8hr-exposure, established by WHO, in 63% and 32% of the surveyed classrooms, respectively. Overall, it is expected that the findings presented in this study will assist the establishment of evidence-based measures (namely based on ensuring proper ventilation rates and air filtration) to mitigate preventable environmental harm in public school buildings, mainly at local and national levels.},

Asthma affects millions of people worldwide. Lima, Peru is one of the most polluted cities in the Americas but has insufficient ground PM2.5 (particulate matter that are 2.5 $\mu$m or less in diameter) measurements to conduct epidemiologic studies regarding air pollution. PM2.5 estimates from a satellite-driven model have recently been made, enabling a study between asthma and PM2.5.
Objective
We conducted a daily time-series analysis to determine the association between asthma emergency department (ED) visits and estimated ambient PM2.5 levels in Lima, Peru from 2010 to 2016.
Methods
We used Poisson generalized linear models to regress aggregated counts of asthma on district-level population weighted PM2.5. Indicator variables for hospitals, districts, and day of week were included to account for spatial and temporal autocorrelation while assessing same day, previous day, day before previous and average across all 3-day exposures. We also included temperature and humidity to account for meteorology and used dichotomous percent poverty and gender variables to assess effect modification.
Results
There were 103,974 cases of asthma ED visits during the study period across 39 districts in Lima. We found a 3.7% (95% CI: 1.7%–5.8%) increase in ED visits for every interquartile range (IQR, 6.02 $\mu$g/m3) increase in PM2.5 same day exposure with no age stratification. For the 0–18 years age group, we found a 4.5% (95% CI: 2.2%–6.8%) increase in ED visits for every IQR increase in PM2.5 same day exposure. For the 19–64 years age group, we found a 6.0% (95% CI: 1.0%–11.0%) increase in ED visits for every IQR in average 3-day exposure. For the 65 years and up age group, we found a 16.0% (95% CI: 7.0%–24.0%) decrease in ED visits for every IQR increase in PM2.5 average 3-day exposure, although the number of visits in this age group was low (4,488). We found no effect modification by SES or gender.
Discussion
Results from this study provide additional literature on use of satellite-driven exposure estimates in time-series analyses and evidence for the association between PM2.5 and asthma in a low- and middle-income (LMIC) country.},

Epidemiological evidence associates chronic exposure to particulate matter (PM) with respiratory damage and lung cancer. Inhaled PM may induce systemic effects including inflammation and metastasis. This study evaluated whether PM induces expression of adhesion molecules in lung cancer cells promoting interaction with monocytes.
Methods
The expression of early and late adhesion molecules and their receptors was evaluated in A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma) cells using a wide range of concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10. Then we evaluated cellular adhesion between A549 cells and U937 (human monocytes) cells after PM exposure.
Results
We found higher expression of both early and late adhesion molecules and their ligands in lung adenocarcinoma cells exposed to PM2.5 and PM10 particles present in the air pollution at Mexico City from 0.03 $\mu$g/cm2 with a statistically significant difference (p ≤ 0.05). PM10 had stronger effect than PM2.5. Both PM also stimulated cellular adhesion between tumor cells and monocytes.
Conclusions
This study reveals a comprehensive expression profile of adhesion molecules and their ligands upregulated by PM2.5 and PM10 in A549 cells. Additionally these particles induced cellular adhesion of lung cancer cells to monocytes. This highlights possible implications of PM in two cancer hallmarks i.e. inflammation and metastasis, underlying the high cancer mortality associated with air pollution.},

abstract = {The spread of SARS-CoV-2, the beta coronavirus responsible for the current pneumonia pandemic outbreak, has been speculated to be linked to short-term and long-term atmospheric pollutants exposure. The present work has been aimed at analyzing the atmospheric pollutants concentrations (PM10, PM2.5, NO2) and spatio-temporal distribution of cases and deaths (specifically incidence, mortality and lethality rates) across the whole Italian national territory, down to the level of each individual territorial area, with the goal of checking any potential short-term correlation between these two phenomena. The data analysis has been limited to the first quarter of 2020 to reduce the lockdown-dependent biased effects on the atmospheric pollutant levels as much as possible. The analysis looked at non-linear, monotonic correlations using the Spearman non-parametric correlation index. The statistical significance of the Spearman correlations has also been evaluated. The results of the statistical analysis suggest the hypothesis of a moderate-to-strong correlation between the number of days exceeding the annual regulatory limits of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 atmospheric pollutants and COVID-19 incidence, mortality and lethality rates for all the 107 territorial areas in Italy. A weak-to-moderate correlation seems to exist when considering the 36 territorial areas in four of the most affected regions (Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto). Overall, PM10 and PM2.5 showed a higher non-linear correlation than NO2 with incidence, mortality and lethality rates. As to particulate matters, PM10 profile has been compared with the incidence rate variation that occurred in three of the most affected territorial areas in Northern Italy (i.e., Milan, Brescia, and Bergamo). All areas showed a similar PM10 time trend but a different incidence rate variation, that was less severe in Milan compared with Brescia and Bergamo.},

The data used herein is obtained from simulations of airflow dynamics and deposition fractions of drug particle aerosols in the downstream airways of asthma patients using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete particle motion (DPM). Three main parameters, including airflow rate, drug dose, and particle size, affecting aerosol deposition in the lungs of asthma patients are examined. The highest deposition fraction (DF) is obtained at the flow rate of 45 L min−1, the drug dose of 200 $\mu$g{\textperiodcentered}puff−1, and the particle diameter of 5 $\mu$m. The optimized combination of levels for the three parameters for maximum drug deposition is performed via the Taguchi method. The importance of the influencing factors rank as particle size > drug dose > flow rate. RSM reveals that the combination of 30 L min−1, 5 $\mu$m, 200 $\mu$g{\textperiodcentered}puff− has the highest deposition fraction. In part, this research also studied the deposition of bioaerosols contaminated with the SAR-CoV-2 virus, and their lowest DF is 1.15%. The low DF of bioaerosols reduces the probability of the SAR-CoV-2 virus transmission.},

abstract = {Levels of toxic elements in ambient PM2.5 were measured from 29 October 2019 to 30 March 2020 in Linfen, China, to assess the health risks they posed and to identify critical risk sources during different periods of the COVID-19 lockdown and haze episodes using positive matrix factorization (PMF) and a health-risk assessment model. The mean PM2.5 concentration during the study period was 145 $\mu$g/m3, and the 10 investigated toxic elements accounted for 0.31% of the PM2.5 mass. The total non-cancer risk (HI) and total cancer risk (TCR) of the selected toxic elements exceed the US EPA limits for children and adults. The HI for children was 2.3 times that for adults for all periods, which is likely due to the high inhalation rate per unit body weight for children. While the TCR for adults was 1.7 times that of children, which is mainly attributed to potential longer exposure duration for adults. The HI and TCR of the toxic elements during full lockdown were reduced by 66% and 58%, respectively, compared to their pre-lockdown levels. The HI and TCR were primarily attributable to Mn and As, respectively. Health risks during haze episodes were significantly higher than the average levels during COVID-19 lockdowns, though the HI and TCR of the selected toxic elements during full-lockdown haze episodes were 68% and 17% lower, respectively, than were the levels during pre-lockdown haze episodes. During the study period, fugitive dust and steel-related smelting were the highest contributors to HI and TCR, respectively, and decreased in these emission sources contributed the most to the lower health risks observed during the full lockdown. There, the control of these sources is critical to effectively reduce public health risks.},

abstract = {Aim
to investigate the relation of pulmonary function impairment with mortality and the possible mediation by low-grade inflammation in a general adult population.
Methods
A prospective investigation was conducted on 14,503 individuals from the Moli-sani study (apparently free from lung disease and acute inflammatory status at baseline; 2005–2010). The 2012 Global Lung Function Initiative percent predicted (% pred) value of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow at 25–75% of FVC (FEF25-75) and FEV1 quotient (FEV1Q) index were used. C-reactive protein and blood cell counts were measured and a score of subclinical inflammation (INFLA-score) was calculated.
Results
Over a median follow-up of 8.6y, 503 deaths (28.9% cardiovascular) were ascertained. Total mortality increased by 19% for each decrease in 1 standard deviation of FEV1% pred or FVC% pred (Hazard Ratio:1.19; 95% CI:1.11–1.28 and 1.19; 1.10–1.28, respectively). Comparable findings for FEV1Q (1.30; 1.15–1.47) were observed. A statistically significant increased risk in cardiovascular mortality of 23%, 32% and 49% was observed for 1 standard deviation decrease of FEV1% pred, FVC% pred and FEV1Q, respectively. INFLA-score mediated the association of FEV1% pred and FEV1Q with cardiovascular mortality by 22.3% and 20.1%, respectively. Subjects with FEV1, FVC lower than normal limit showed increased risk both in total and cardiovascular mortality. Abnormal FEF25-75 values were associated with 33% (1.33; 1.02–1.74) total mortality risk.
Conclusions
Obstructive lung function impairment was associated with decreased survival. Low-grade inflammation mainly mediated the association of FEV1 with cardiovascular mortality.},

In spite of the extensive study of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP, a representative of PAHs), its potential biophysical influence on the natural PS is still largely unknown. In this study, the interfacial interaction between PS (extracted from porcine lungs) and BaP is investigated in vitro. The results showed that the surface tension, phase behavior, and interfacial structure of the PS monolayers were obviously altered in the presence of BaP. A solubilization test manifested that PS and its major components (dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, DPPC; bovine serum albumin, BSA) could in turn accelerate the dissolution of BaP, which followed the order: PS > DPPC > BSA, and mixed phospholipids were significantly responsible for the solubilization of BaP by PS. In addition, solubilization of BaP also enhanced the consumption of hydroxyl radicals ({\textperiodcentered}OH) in the simulated lung fluid, which could disturb the balance between oxidation and antioxidation.},

abstract = {Background
Air pollution exposure may make people more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. However, previous studies in this area mostly focused on infection before May 2020 and long-term exposure.
Objective
To assess both long-term and short-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 incidence across four case surges from 03/1/2020 to 02/28/2021.
Methods
The cohort included 4.6 million members from a large integrated health care system in southern California with comprehensive electronic medical records (EMR). COVID-19 cases were identified from EMR. Incidence of COVID-19 was computed at the census tract-level among members. Prior 1-month and 1-year averaged air pollutant levels (PM2.5, NO2, and O3) at the census tract-level were estimated based on hourly and daily air quality data. Data analyses were conducted by each wave: 3/1/2020–5/31/2020, 6/1/202–9/30/2020, 10/1/2020–12/31/2020, and 1/1/2021–2/28/2021 and pooled across waves using meta-analysis. Generalized linear mixed effects models with Poisson distribution and spatial autocorrelation were used with adjustment for meteorological factors and census tract-level social and health characteristics. Results were expressed as relative risk (RR) per 1 standard deviation.
Results
The cohort included 446,440 COVID-19 cases covering 4609 census tracts. The pooled RRs (95% CI) of COVID-19 incidence associated with 1-year exposures to PM2.5, NO2, and O3 were 1.11 (1.04, 1.18) per 2.3 $\mu$g/m3,1.09 (1.02, 1.17) per 3.2 ppb, and 1.06 (1.00, 1.12) per 5.5 ppb respectively. The corresponding RRs (95% CI) associated with prior 1-month exposures were 1.11 (1.03, 1.20) per 5.2 $\mu$g/m3 for PM2.5, 1.09 (1.01, 1.17) per 6.0 ppb for NO2 and 0.96 (0.85, 1.08) per 12.0 ppb for O3.
Conclusion
Long-term PM2.5 and NO2 exposures were associated with increased risk of COVID-19 incidence across all case surges before February 2021. Short-term PM2.5 and NO2 exposures were also associated. Our findings suggest that air pollution may play a role in increasing the risk of COVID-19 infection.},

abstract = {The emergence of a new coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a major global concern that has damaged human health and disturbing environmental quality. Some researchers have identified a positive relationship between air pollution (fine particulate matter PM2.5) and COVID-19. Nonetheless, no inclusive investigation has comprehensively examined this relationship for a tropical climate such as India. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by investigating the nexus between air pollution and COVID-19 in the ten most affected Indian states using daily observations from 9th March to September 20, 2020. The study has used the newly developed Hidden Panel Cointegration test and Nonlinear Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (NPARDL) model for asymmetric analysis. Empirical results illustrate an asymmetric relationship between PM2.5 and COVID-19 cases. More precisely, a 1% change in the positive shocks of PM2.5 increases the COVID-19 cases by 0.439%. Besides, the estimates of individual states expose the heterogeneous effects of PM2.5 on COVID-19. The asymmetric causality test of Hatemi-J's (2011) also suggests that the positive shocks on PM2.5 Granger-cause positive shocks on COVID19 cases. Research findings indicate that air pollution is the root cause of this outbreak; thus, the government should recognize this channel and implement robust policy guidelines to control the spread of environmental pollution.},

abstract = {Objective
This study evaluated the association of the short-term exposure to environmental factors (relative humidity, temperature, NO2, SO2, O3, PM10, and CO) with hospital admissions due to acute viral lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in children under two years before the COVID-19 era.
Methods
We performed a bidirectional case-crossover study in 30,445 children with ALRI under two years of age in the Spanish Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) from 2013 to 2015. Environmental data were obtained from Spain's State Meteorological Agency (AEMET). The association was assessed by conditional logistic regression.
Results
Lower temperature one week before the day of the event (hospital admission) (q-value = 0.012) and higher relative humidity one week (q-value = 0.003) and two weeks (q-value<0.001) before the day of the event were related to a higher odds of hospital admissions. Higher NO2 levels two weeks before the event were associated with hospital admissions (q-value<0.001). Moreover, higher concentrations on the day of the event for SO2 (compared to lag time of 1-week (q-value = 0.026) and 2-weeks (q-value<0.001)), O3 (compared to lag time of 3-days (q-value<0.001), 1-week (q-value<0.001), and 2-weeks (q-value<0.001)), and PM10 (compared to lag time of 2-weeks (q-value<0.001)) were related to an increased odds of hospital admissions for viral ALRI.
Conclusion
Short-term exposure to environmental factors (climatic conditions and ambient air contaminants) was linked to a higher likelihood of hospital admissions due to ALRI. Our findings emphasize the importance of monitoring environmental factors to assess the odds of ALRI hospital admissions and plan public health resources.},

abstract = {In June 2020, we published a review focused on assessing the influence of various air pollutants on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the severity of COVID-19 in patients infected by the coronavirus. The results of most of those reviewed studies suggested that chronic exposure to certain air pollutants might lead to more severe and lethal forms of COVID-19, as well as delays/complications in the recovery of the patients. Since then, a notable number of studies on this topic have been published, including also various reviews. Given the importance of this issue, we have updated the information published since our previous review. Taking together the previous results and those of most investigations now reviewed, we have concluded that there is a significant association between chronic exposure to various outdoor air pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2 and CO, and the incidence/risk of COVID-19 cases, as well as the severity/mortality of the disease. Unfortunately, studies on the potential influence of other important air pollutants such as VOCs, dioxins and furans, or metals, are not available in the scientific literature. In relation to the influence of outdoor air pollutants on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, although the scientific evidence is much more limited, some studies point to PM2.5 and PM10 as potential airborne transmitters of the virus. Anyhow, it is clear that environmental air pollution plays an important negative role in COVID-19, increasing its incidence and mortality.},

Pulmonary autophagy and apoptosis play significant roles in the pathophysiological process of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Nevertheless, the correlations of cadmium exposure with autophagy and apoptosis are obscure in patients with COPD. The main purpose of this research was to explore the correlations among serum cadmium, pulmonary function, pulmonary autophagy and apoptosis in patients with COPD through a case-control study. Lung tissues and serum samples were collected from COPD patients and control cases. Serum cadmium was detected with graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. The protein expression of autophagy and apoptosis were measured in lungs using western blotting. These results indicated that serum cadmium was higher in COPD patients than control cases. Serum cadmium was gradually risen parallelly with the grades of COPD patients. P62, Beclin 1, LC3 Ⅱ and Ⅰ, the markers of autophagy, was elevated in lungs of COPD patients. Additionally, cleaved Caspase 1 and 3, as well as TUNEL positive cells, the molecules of apoptosis, were increased in lungs of COPD patients. In addition, correlational analysis indicated that serum cadmium was positively associated with autophagy and apoptosis in lungs among COPD patients. Besides, pulmonary autophagy and apoptosis were inversely correlated with pulmonary function in COPD patients. In vitro experiments revealed that cadmium exposure induced autophagy and apoptosis in human pulmonary epithelial cells. Consequently, this study firstly shown evidence that cadmium-evoked autophagy activation and apoptosis elevation may, at least partially, contribute to pulmonary function decline in COPD patients.},

Here, the total microorganisms in a coastal megacity, Qingdao, were characterized on the basis of long-term observations from October 2013 to January 2021. Particular attention was given to the size dependence of inhalable bioaerosols in concentration and respiratory deposition in different populations on foggy and hazy days. Bioaerosol samples stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were selected to measure the total airborne microbe (TAM) concentrations with an epifluorescence microscope, while a multiple-path particle dosimetry model was employed to calculate respiratory deposition. The mean TAM concentrations in the particle size range of 0.65–1.1 $\mu$m (TAM0.65–1.1) were 1.23, 2.02, 1.60 and 2.33 times those on sunny reference days relative to the corresponding values on days with slight, mild, moderate and severe levels of haze, respectively. The mean concentration of TAMs in the particle size range of 0.65–2.1 $\mu$m (TAM0.65–2.1) on severely hazy days was (2.02 ± 3.28) × 105 cells/m3, with a reduction of 4.16% relative to that on the reference days. The mean TAM0.65–2.1 concentration changed from (1.50 ± 1.37) × 105 cells/m3 to (1.76 ± 1.36) × 105 cells/m3, with TAM0.65–1.1 increasing from (7.91 ± 7.97) × 104 cells/m3 to (1.76 ± 1.33) × 105 cells/m3 on days with light fog days and medium fog, respectively. The modeling results showed that the majority of TAM0.65–2.1 deposition occurred in the extrathoracic (ET) region, followed by the alveolar (AL) region. When different populations were examined separately, the deposition doses (DDs) in adult females and in children ranked at the minimum value (6.19 × 103 cells/h) and maximum value (1.08 × 104 cells/h), respectively. However, the inhalation risks on polluted days, such as hazy, foggy and mixed hazy–foggy (HF) days, were still below the threshold for adverse impacts on human health.},

Hospitalization records of children aged 0–18 years due to all-cause respiratory diseases (889,926), AURIs (97,858), and ALRIs (642,154) from 2016 to 2019 were extracted. Concentrations of CO, NO2, SO2, and O3 were averaged across monitoring stations. Generalized additive models were used to estimate the associations between gaseous air pollutants and daily hospitalizations for all-cause respiratory disease, AURIs, and ALRIs. The meta-analysis was used to combine the city-specific estimates. A 10 mg/m3 increase in CO at lag01, and a 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in NO2, SO2, and O3 at lag01 were associated with 1.65% (95%CI, 0.41–2.91), 0.54% (95%CI, 0.30–0.79), 0.60% (95%CI, 0.22–0.99), and 0.23% (95%CI, 0.06–0.39) increase of hospitalizations due to all-cause respiratory disease, respectively. For the disease subtype, O3 only had adverse effects on AURIs, CO and SO2 mainly on ALRIs, and NO2 on both AURIs and ALRIs. Children aged 4–6years were more vulnerable to the effects of CO and NO2, but those aged <1year were more susceptible to SO2 and O3. Besides, the O3 effect was stronger in the warm season than in the cold season. The study indicated that short-term exposure to CO, NO2, SO2, and O3 was associated with increased hospitalization for pediatric respiratory disease, and the association may vary by position of the respiratory tract, age, and season.},

abstract = {Respiratory infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19) have brought huge damages to human society, and the accurate prediction of their transmission trends is essential for both the health system and policymakers. Most related studies focus on epidemic trend forecasting at the macroscopic level, which ignores the microscopic social interactions among individuals. Meanwhile, current microscopic models are still not able to sufficiently decipher the individual-based spreading process and lack valid quantitative tests. To tackle these problems, we propose an exposure-risk-based model at the microscopic level, including 4 modules: individual movement, virion-laden droplet movement, individual exposure risk estimation, and prediction of transmission trends. Firstly, the front two modules reproduce the movements of individuals and the droplets of infectors' expiratory activities, respectively. Then, the outputs are fed to the third module to estimate the personal exposure risk. Finally, the number of new cases is predicted in the final module. By predicting the new COVID- 19 cases in the United States, the performances of our model and 4 other existing macroscopic or microscopic models are compared. Specifically, the mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error provided by the proposed model are respectively 2454.70, 3170.51, and 3.38% smaller than the minimum results of comparison models. The quantitative results reveal that our model can accurately predict the transmission trends from a microscopic perspective, and it can benefit the further investigation of many microscopic disease transmission factors (e.g., non-walkable areas and facility layouts).},

abstract = {Rationale
Many clinical and psychological factors are known to influence the health-related quality of life (HRQL) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, research on whether environmental factors, such as air pollution, noise, temperature, and blue/green spaces also influence HRQL in COPD has not been systematically investigated.
Objective
To assess the relationship between air pollution, road traffic noise, temperature, and distance to blue/green spaces and respiratory-specific HRQL in COPD.
Methods
We used cross-sectional data from a multicenter study in 407 stable mild-to-very severe COPD patients from Barcelona (Catalonia). Patients answered the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ). Individual residential exposure to air pollutants (nitrogen dioxide [NO2] and particulate matters of varying aerodynamic diameters [PM2.5, PM10, and PM2.5absorbance]), road traffic noise (Lden), and land surface temperature were estimated using long-term averages from land-use regression models, 24-h noise maps, and land surface temperature maps, respectively. We measured residential distances to blue/green spaces from the Urban Atlas. We used mixed-effect negative binomial (for CAT) and linear (for CCQ) regression models, adjusted for potential confounders, with a random effect by center.
Results
Of those patients, 85 % were male and had a mean (SD) age of 69 (9) years, CAT score of 12 (7), CCQ-total score of 1.4 (1.0), and post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 57 (18) %predicted. We found that NO2 and PM2.5absorbance were associated with worsened CAT and CCQ-mental scores, e.g., 0.15-unit change in CAT score [regression coefficient ($\beta$) = 0.15; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0.03, 0.26] per interquartile range in NO2 [13.7 $\mu$g/m3]. Greater distances to blue/green spaces were associated with worsened CCQ-mental scores [0.08; 0.002, 0.15].
Conclusions
Our study showed that increased air pollution, particularly NO2 and PM2.5absorbance and greater distances to blue/green spaces negatively influence HRQL in COPD patients. These findings have important implications for the WHO promotion to develop healthy cities for our future.},

abstract = {Individual-level studies with adjustment for important COVID-19 risk factors suggest positive associations of long-term air pollution exposure (particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide) with COVID-19 infection, hospitalisations and mortality. The evidence, however, remains limited and mechanisms unclear. We aimed to investigate these associations within UK Biobank, and to examine the role of underlying chronic disease as a potential mechanism. UK Biobank COVID-19 positive laboratory test results were ascertained via Public Health England and general practitioner record linkage, COVID-19 hospitalisations via Hospital Episode Statistics, and COVID-19 mortality via Office for National Statistics mortality records from March–December 2020. We used annual average outdoor air pollution modelled at 2010 residential addresses of UK Biobank participants who resided in England (n = 424,721). We obtained important COVID-19 risk factors from baseline UK Biobank questionnaire responses (2006–2010) and general practitioner record linkage. We used logistic regression models to assess associations of air pollution with COVID-19 outcomes, adjusted for relevant confounders, and conducted sensitivity analyses. We found positive associations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with COVID-19 positive test result after adjustment for confounders and COVID-19 risk factors, with odds ratios of 1.05 (95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.02, 1.08), and 1.05 (95% CI = 1.01, 1.08), respectively. PM 2.5 and NO 2 were positively associated with COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths in minimally adjusted models, but not in fully adjusted models. No associations for PM10 were found. In analyses with additional adjustment for pre-existing chronic disease, effect estimates were not substantially attenuated, indicating that underlying chronic disease may not fully explain associations. We found some evidence that long-term exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 was associated with a COVID-19 positive test result in UK Biobank, though not with COVID-19 hospitalisations or deaths.},

abstract = {Background
Household air pollution (HAP) from cooking with solid fuels has been associated with adverse respiratory effects, but most studies use surveys of fuel use to define HAP exposure, rather than on actual air pollution exposure measurements.
Objective
To examine associations between household and personal fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon (BC) measures and respiratory symptoms.
Methods
As part of the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology Air Pollution study, we analyzed 48-h household and personal PM2.5 and BC measurements for 870 individuals using different cooking fuels from 62 communities in 8 countries (Bangladesh, Chile, China, Colombia, India, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe). Self-reported respiratory symptoms were collected after monitoring. Associations between PM2.5 and BC exposures and respiratory symptoms were examined using logistic regression models, controlling for individual, household, and community covariates.
Results
The median (interquartile range) of household and personal PM2.5 was 73.5 (119.1) and 65.3 (91.5) $\mu$g/m3, and for household and personal BC was 3.4 (8.3) and 2.5 (4.9) x10−5 m−1, respectively. We observed associations between household PM2.5 and wheeze (OR: 1.25; 95%CI: 1.07, 1.46), cough (OR: 1.22; 95%CI: 1.06, 1.39), and sputum (OR: 1.26; 95%CI: 1.10, 1.44), as well as exposure to household BC and wheeze (OR: 1.20; 95%CI: 1.03, 1.39) and sputum (OR: 1.20; 95%CI: 1.05, 1.36), per IQR increase. We observed associations between personal PM2.5 and wheeze (OR: 1.23; 95%CI: 1.00, 1.50) and sputum (OR: 1.19; 95%CI: 1.00, 1.41). For household PM2.5 and BC, associations were generally stronger for females compared to males. Models using an indicator variable of solid versus clean fuels resulted in larger OR estimates with less precision.
Conclusions
We used measurements of household and personal air pollution for individuals using different cooking fuels and documented strong associations with respiratory symptoms.},

@article{Ishmatov2022,
abstract = {In epidemiology, there are still outdated myths associated with the spread of respiratory infections. Recently, we have witnessed the origination of a new misconception, to the effect that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted in the open air by way of particulate air pollution (atmospheric particulate matter (PM)). There is no evidence to support the idea behind this misconception. Nevertheless, more and more people are involved in animated debate and the number of studies concerning atmospheric PM as a carrier of SARS-CoV-2 is growing rapidly. In this work, the origin of the misconception was investigated, and the published papers which have contributed to the spread of this myth were analyzed. The results show that the following factors lie behind the origin and spread of the misconception: a) The specific terminology is not always clearly defined or consistently used by scientists. In particular, the terms ‘particulate matter', ‘atmospheric aerosol particles', ‘air pollutants', and ‘atmospheric aerosols' need to be clarified, and besides they are often equated to ‘infectious aerosols', ‘virus-bearing aerosols', ‘bio-aerosols', ‘virus-laden particles', ‘respiratory aerosol/droplets', and ‘droplet nuclei'. b) Authors misinterpret statistical data and information from other sources. Interpretation of the correlation between PM levels and the increasing incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection, is often changed from “PM may reflect the indirect action of certain atmospheric conditions that maintain infectious nuclei suspended for prolonged periods, parameters that also act on atmospheric pollutants” to “PM could cause an increase in infectious droplets/aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2.” This is a dramatic change to the meaning. Moreover, it is often not taken into account that PM may reflect activities in areas with high population density and this population density at the same time contributes to the spread COVID-19. c) Skewed citation practices. Many authors cite a hypothetical conclusion from an original study, then other authors cite the papers of these authors as primary sources. This practice leads to the effect that there are many witnesses to a ‘phenomenon' that did not ever occur. Thus, the terminology used in interdisciplinary communications should be more nuanced and defined precisely. Authors should be more careful when citing unconfirmed data (and hypotheses) as well as in interpreting statistical data so as to avoid confusion and spreading false information. This is especially important now in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.},

abstract = {Previous studies have attempted to clarify the relationship between the occurrence of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and exposure to air pollutants. However, evidence from multi-centres, particularly at the national level, is scarce, and no study has examined the modifying effect of greenness on air pollution–TB associations. In this study, we examined the association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants (PM10 p.m.2.5, and O3) and monthly PTB or smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (SPPTB) incidence to further evaluate whether these associations were affected by greenness in mainland China using a two-stage analytic procedure. PM2.5 was positively associated with both PTB and SPPTB incidence, with relative risk (RR) of 1.12 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03, 1.22) and 1.08 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.10) per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase, respectively. Furthermore, PM10 was positively associated with PTB incidence, with RR of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.13). However, O3 was not associated with the monthly incidence of PTB or SPPTB. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) exhibited a modifying effect on the association between PM2.5 exposure and SPPTB incidence in northern areas, with RR of 1.16 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.31) in lower mean annual NDVI areas than in the higher areas (RR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.09). This nationwide analysis indicated that NDVI could reduce the effect of air pollutants on TB incidence particularly in the northern areas. Long-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) may increase the occurrence of PTB or SPPTB in China, and further studies involving larger numbers of SPPTB cases are required to confirm the effects of PM exposure on SPPTB incidence in the future.},

abstract = {It is undeniable that exposure to outdoor air pollution impacts the health of populations and therefore constitutes a public health problem. Any actions or events causing variations in air quality have repercussions on populations' health. Faced with the worldwide COVID-19 health crisis that began at the end of 2019, the governments of several countries were forced, in the beginning of 2020, to put in place very strict containment measures that could have led to changes in air quality. While many works in the literature have studied the issue of changes in the levels of air pollutants during the confinements in different countries, very few have focused on the impact of these changes on health risks. In this work, we compare the 2020 period, which includes two lockdowns (March 16 - May 10 and a partial shutdown Oct. 30 - Dec. 15) to a reference period 2015–2019 to determine how these government-mandated lockdowns affected concentrations of NO2, O3, PM2.5, and PM10, and how that affected human health factors, including low birth weight, lung cancer, mortality, asthma, non-accidental mortality, respiratory, and cardiovascular illnesses. To this end, we structured 2020 into four periods, alternating phases of freedom and lockdowns characterized by a stringency index. For each period, we calculated (1) the differences in pollutant levels between 2020 and a reference period (2015–2019) at both background and traffic stations; and (2) the resulting variations in the epidemiological based relative risks of health outcomes. As a result, we found that relative changes in pollutant levels during the 2020 restriction period were as follows: NO2 (−32%), PM2.5 (−22%), PM10 (−15%), and O3 (+10.6%). The pollutants associated with the highest health risk reductions in 2020 were PM2.5 and NO2, while PM10 and O3 changes had almost no effect on health outcomes. Reductions in short-term risks were related to reductions in PM2.5 (−3.2% in child emergency room visits for asthma during the second lockdown) and NO2 (−1.5% in hospitalizations for respiratory causes). Long-term risk reductions related to PM2.5 were low birth weight (−8%), mortality (−3.3%), and lung cancer (−2%), and to NO2 for mortality (−0.96%). Overall, our findings indicate that the confinement period in 2020 resulted in a substantial improvement in air quality in the Grenoble area.},

@article{Prinz2022,
abstract = {Background
COVID-19 is a lung disease, and there is medical evidence that air pollution is one of the external causes of lung diseases. Fine particulate matter is one of the air pollutants that damages pulmonary tissue. The combination of the coronavirus and fine particulate matter air pollution may exacerbate the coronavirus' effect on human health.
Research question
This paper considers whether the long-term concentration of fine particulate matter of different sizes changes the number of detected coronavirus infections and the number of COVID-19 fatalities in Germany.
Study design
Data from 400 German counties for fine particulate air pollution from 2002 to 2020 are used to measure the long-term impact of air pollution. Kriging interpolation is applied to complement data gaps. With an ecological study, the correlation between average particulate matter air pollution and COVID-19 cases, as well as fatalities, are estimated with OLS regressions. Thereby, socioeconomic and demographic covariates are included.
Main findings
An increase in the average long-term air pollution of 1 $\mu$g/m3 particulate matter PM2.5 is correlated with 199.46 (SD = 29.66) more COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Germany. For PM10 the respective increase is 52.38 (SD = 12.99) more cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The number of COVID-19 deaths were also positively correlated with PM2.5 and PM10 (6.18, SD = 1.44, respectively 2.11, SD = 0.71, additional COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants).
Conclusion
Long-term fine particulate air pollution is suspected as causing higher numbers of COVID-19 cases. Higher long-term air pollution may even increase COVID-19 death rates. We find that the results of the correlation analysis without controls are retained in a regression analysis with controls for relevant confounding factors. Nevertheless, additional epidemiological investigations are required to test the causality of particulate matter air pollution for COVID-19 cases and the severity.},

Their polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) compositions were determined for respiratory health risk assessment. During SH episode, concentrations of SPMs and PAHs in the rural area were approximately two times higher than in the urban area and about 62–68% of the SPMs were fine particles. Conversely, during NSH season the concentrations in the urban area were higher due to traffic emission. The finest particle sizes (0.65–0.43 $\mu$m) contained the highest PAHs concentrations among the other PM sizes. Benzo[b]fluoranthene was a main PAH component found during SH season suggesting biomass burning is a major pollutant source. High molecular weight (5–6 rings) PAHs with high carcinogenicity were likely to concentrate in fine particles. Distribution patterns of SPMs and PAHs during SH season were bimodal with the highest peak at a fine size range (0.65–0.43 $\mu$m) and a small peak at a coarse size range (5.8–4.7 $\mu$m). Respiratory health risk was estimated based on toxicity equivalent concentrations of PAHs bound-SPMs and inhalation cancer risk (ICR). Relatively high ICR values (1.14 × 10−4 (rural) and 6.80 × 10−5 (urban)) were found during SH season in both areas, in which fine particles played an important role. It revealed that high concentration of fine particles in ambient air is related to high respiratory health risk due to high content of carcinogenic substances.},

The highest PM10 and SO2 concentration values during the winter season were found in Can district. Among all air quality station records in Canakkale, PM10 and SO2 values of Can Station exceeded the daily threshold limits set by WHO in 68% and 79% of the days, respectively.It was found that local and large-scale emission sources cause the highest PM10 concentrations in the cold season under low wind speed/calm weather conditions and during southerly winds that exceed 8 m/s. In terms of SO2 concentrations, the highest values were also recorded in Can district and under low wind speed conditions or during calm days, only local emission sources increase the pollutant levels. This pollution is mainly caused by thermal power plants located in Can district. Analysis on relationship between air pollutants and respiratory diseases shows that, Asthma symptoms in children (0–14) were found to be positively correlated with both SO2 concentrations (OR = 1.37; 95% Cl: 0.95–1.98) at lag 6 and PM10 concentrations (Odds ratio [OR] = 3.41; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.96–5.95).

abstract = {Background
Northern China has severe air pollution, especially in winter. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is an established biomarker of airway inflammation.
Aim
To study associations between ambient temperature, air pollution and FeNO in university students in northern China.
Methods
We performed a panel study in 67 university students without asthma diagnosis in the city of Taiyuan. FeNO was measured 6 times, over one heating season. Outdoor PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2 and O3 were measured at a fixed location in the campus. SO2, NO2 and O3 were measured 7 days (24 h/day) before the FeNO test. PM2.5 and PM10 were measured at different lag times (lag 1 day to lag 7 days). Temperature and carbon monoxide (CO) data were collected from a nearby monitoring station (lag 7). Linear mixed models were applied to study associations between exposure and FeNO, adjusting for gender, age, current smoking, height and furry pet or pollen allergy.
Results
The overall geometric mean (GM) of FeNO was 17.2 ppb. GM of FeNO was lowest (12.9 ppb) in January and highest (20.0 ppb) in April. The range of lag 7 pollution was 105.0–339.0 $\mu$g/m3 for PM10, 72.0–180.0 $\mu$g/m3 for PM2.5, 36.0–347.0 $\mu$g/m3 for SO2, 26.0–69.0 $\mu$g/m3 for NO2, 31.0–163.0 $\mu$g/m3 for O3 and 0.93–3.14 mg/m3 for CO. The lag 7 temperature ranged from −4.5 to 20.1 °C. FeNO was consistently higher at higher outdoor temperature (p < 0.001). In multi-pollutant models with temperature adjustment, PM10, PM2.5 and SO2 were associated with FeNO (all p-values <0.001). In contrast, CO was negatively associated (protective) with FeNO (p < 0.001). Associations between exposure and FeNO were similar in men and women.
Conclusion
PM10, PM2.5 and SO2 and outdoor temperature can be associated with airway inflammation, measured as FeNO, in young adults in northern China while CO could be negatively associated with FeNO.},

Similar data from Tehran were gathered for comparison. The results of this study underscore that it is possible, if not likely, that pollution nanoparticles are related to COVID-19 fatalities (Granger causality, p < 0.05), contributing to the understanding of the environmental impact on pandemics.},

abstract = {Studies suggested that the smaller particle size has more adverse effects on cardiorespiratory diseases. However, the associations between PM1 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤1 $\mu$m) and cardiorespiratory diseases remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to summarize and quantify the associations between short-term exposure to PM1 and morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Four databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CNKI) were searched for articles published up to March 16, 2021. Meta-analysis was used to pool the effect estimates of PM1 on cardiovascular and respiratory diseases [i.e., relative risk (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (CI)]. Subgroup analysis were conducted based on the statistical analysis methods, disease subtypes, and pollutant models. Finally, 12 studies were included, and we observed significant associations between PM1 and both cardiovascular mortality (ER: 0.84%, 95%CI: 0.06%, 1.64%) and respiratory mortality (ER: 0.57%, 95%CI: 0.30%, 0.78%). However, a significant PM1-morbidity association was only found for total respiratory morbidity (ER: 2.60%, 95%CI: 1.00%, 4.30%). The results of the subgroup analysis showed that only the association between asthma and PM1 was significant (ER: 2.60%, 95%CI: 1.00%, 4.30%), and the risk based on the two-pollutant model was higher than that of the single-pollutant model. Considering the limited number of available studies, our findings should be proven in future studies involved in varying settings, disease subtypes, and advanced study designs.},

abstract = {Background
Physical activity and exercise capacity are key prognostic factors in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but their environmental determinants are unknown.
Objectives
To test the association between urban environment and objective physical activity, physical activity experience and exercise capacity in COPD.
Methods
We studied 404 patients with mild-to-very severe COPD from a multi-city study in Catalonia, Spain. We measured objective physical activity (step count and sedentary time) by the Dynaport MoveMonitor, physical activity experience (difficulty with physical activity) by the Clinical visit-PROactive (C-PPAC) instrument, and exercise capacity by the 6-min walk distance (6MWD). We estimated individually (geocoded to the residential address) population density, pedestrian street length, slope of terrain, and long-term (i.e., annual) exposure to road traffic noise, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5). We built single- and multi-exposure mixed-effects linear regressions with a random intercept for city, adjusting for confounders.
Results
Patients were 85% male, had mean (SD) age 69 (9) years and walked 7524 (4045) steps/day. In multi-exposure models, higher population density was associated with fewer steps, more sedentary time and worse exercise capacity (−507 [95% CI: 1135, 121] steps, +0.2 [0.0, 0.4] h/day and −13 [-25, 0] m per IQR). Pedestrian street length related with more steps and less sedentary time (156 [9, 304] steps and −0.1 [-0.1, 0.0] h/day per IQR). Steeper slope was associated with better exercise capacity (15 [3, 27] m per IQR). Higher NO2 levels related with more sedentary time and more difficulty in physical activity. PM2.5 and noise were not associated with physical activity or exercise capacity.
Discussion
Population density, pedestrian street length, slope and NO2 exposure relate to physical activity and capacity of COPD patients living in highly populated areas. These findings support the consideration of neighbourhood environmental factors during COPD management and the attention to patients with chronic diseases when developing urban and transport planning policies.},

abstract = {Particulate matter (PM), a crucial air pollutant is related with range of human health effects. PM having aerodynamic diameter ≤10 $\mu$m enter the human airways due to its smaller size and gets deposited in various regions of lungs. However, age-specific seasonal deposition under various sampling environments and site locations are not addressed in the Indian context. Hence this study aims to estimate the PM deposition during monsoon, winter, and summer seasons in outdoor and indoor environments of traffic and residential sites for different age groups at Vellore city, India. PM was collected using nine-stage impactor. PM2.5 and PM10 deposition in infants, children, adults, and elderly were estimated using Multiple Path Particle Dosimetry (MPPD) model. Total, regional, lobar, and generation-specific PM deposition were estimated and discussed in the study. Results showed that annual average of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations exceeded the Indian and World Health Organization standards. Total deposition of PM10 was consistently larger than PM2.5 across all age groups. Children and elderly experienced highest total PM2.5 and PM10 deposition, respectively during summer in traffic outdoor environment. Regional results showed that head and alveolar regions were dominated by PM10 and PM2.5 depositions, respectively. The deposited mass rate was found highest in elderly followed by adults, children, and infants irrespective of size. Lower lobes received maximum deposition than other lobes. Also, the trend of increased PM deposition fraction after 20th generation was found. PM pollution and deposition in residential site and indoor environment were comparable to traffic site and outdoor environment, respectively.},

abstract = {The influences of weather and air pollutants on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been well-studied. However, the heterogeneous effects of different influenza viral infections, air pollution and weather on COPD admissions and re-admissions have not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the relationships between meteorological variables, air pollutants, seasonal influenza, and hospital admissions and re-admissions due to COPD in Hong Kong, a non-industrial influenza epicenter. A total number of 507703 hospital admissions (i.e., index admissions) and 301728 re-admission episodes (i.e., episodes within 30 days after the previous discharge) for COPD over 14 years (1998–2011) were obtained from all public hospitals. The aggregated weekly numbers were matched with meteorological records and outdoor air pollutant concentrations. Type-specific and all-type influenza-like illness positive (ILI+) rates were used as proxies for influenza activity. Generalized additive models were used in conjunction with distributed-lag non-linear models to estimate the associations of interest. According to the results, high concentrations of fine particulate matter, oxidant gases, and cold weather were strong independent risk factors of COPD outcomes. The cumulative adjusted relative risks exhibited a monotone increasing trend except for ILI+ B, and the numbers were statistically significant over the entire observed range of ILI+ total and ILI+ A/H3N2 when the reference rate was zero. COPD hospitalization risk from influenza infection was higher in the elderly than that in the general population. In conclusion, our results suggest that health administrators should impose clean air policies, such as strengthening emissions control on petrol vehicles, to reduce pollution from oxidant gases and particulates. An extension of the influenza vaccination program for patients with COPD may need to be encouraged: for example, vaccination may be included in hospital discharge planning, particularly before the winter epidemic.},

abstract = {Background
Research on the association between chronic inflammatory airway diseases (CIADs), defined as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and impaired lung function, and long-term exposure of outdoor air pollutants for adults has been scarce.
Research question
Effects of long-term exposure for outdoor air pollutants to the risk of CIADs in adults.
Materials and methods
Applying data from Taiwan Biobank, 10-year accumulative exposure of major outdoor air pollutants, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3, was estimated by Kriging's interpolation, based on 76 nationwide air pollution monitoring stations linked to residency information at township or district level at baseline interview for volunteered community participants older than 30 years old. Eligible cases and randomly selected healthy controls constructed a nested case-control study with frequency matching on age and sex at a ratio of 1:4. We adopted logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of outdoor air pollutants to the risk of CIADs for univariable and multivariable analyses. For detecting potential interactions among critical covariates, we used the generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction method.
Results
Higher 10-year cumulative exposure of NO2 and SO2 put people at a significantly elevated relative risk of CIADs after confounding control, showing adjusted ORs of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.14) for NO2 and 1.23 (95% CI: 1.15, 1.31) for SO2 for each increment of standard deviation. Furthermore, a significant synergistic interaction (P-value < 0.01 for interaction term) between PM10 and CO in tertiles was detected with an adjusted OR of 5.01 (95% CI: 2.95, 8.49) for the highest tertiles of PM10 and CO combined, relative to the group of lowest tertile combination.
Conclusion
Our outcomes contributed to a more profound understanding on the effects of long-term exposure of air pollutants to CIADs in etiology, highlighting a synergistic interaction between PM10 and CO.},

abstract = {It is enlightening to determine the discrepancies and potential reasons for the degree of impact from the COVID-19 control measures on air quality as well as the associated health and economic impacts. Analysis of air quality, socio-economic factors, and meteorological data from 447 cities in 46 countries indicated that the COVID-19 control measures had significant impacts on the PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 $\mu$m) concentrations in 20 (reduced PM2.5 concentrations of −7.4–29.1 $\mu$g m−3) of the selected 46 countries. In these 20 countries, the robustly distinguished changes in the PM2.5 concentrations caused by the control measures differed between the developed (95% confidence interval (CI): −2.7–5.5 $\mu$g m−3) and developing countries (95% CI: 8.3–23.2 $\mu$g m−3). As a result, the COVID-19 lockdown reduced death and hospital admissions change from the decreased PM2.5 concentrations by 7909 and 82,025 cases in the 12 developing countries, and by 78 and 1214 cases in the eight developed countries. The COVID-19 lockdown reduced the economic cost from the PM2.5 related health burden by 54.0 million dollars in the 12 developing countries and by 8.3 million dollars in the eight developed countries. The disparity was related to the different chemical compositions of PM2.5. In particular, the concentrations of primary PM2.5 (e.g., BC) in cities of developing countries were 3–45 times higher than those in developed countries, so the mass concentration of PM2.5 was more sensitive to the reduced local emissions in developing countries during the COVID-19 control period. The mass fractions of secondary PM2.5 in developed countries were generally higher than those in developing countries. As a result, these countries were more sensitive to the secondary atmospheric processing that may have been enhanced due to reduced local emissions.},

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is severely threatening and challenging public health worldwide. Epidemiological studies focused on the influence of outdoor air pollution (AP) on COVID-19 risk have produced inconsistent conclusions. We aimed to quantitatively explore this association using a meta-analysis.
Methods
We searched for studies related to outdoor AP and COVID-19 risk in the Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. No language restriction was utilized. The search date entries were up to August 13, 2021. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained with random-/fixed-effects models. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021244656.
Results
A total of 35 articles were eligible for the meta-analysis. For long-term exposure to AP, COVID-19 incidence was positively associated with 1 $\mu$g/m3 increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO2; effect size = 1.042, 95% CI 1.017–1.068), particulate matter with diameter <2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5; effect size = 1.056, 95% CI 1.039–1.072), and sulfur dioxide (SO2; effect size = 1.071, 95% CI 1.002–1.145). The COVID-19 mortality was positively associated with 1 $\mu$g/m3 increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO2; effect size = 1.034, 95% CI 1.006–1.063), PM2.5 (effect size = 1.047, 95% CI 1.025–1.1071). For short-term exposure to air pollutants, COVID-19 incidence was positively associated with 1 unit increase in air quality index (effect size = 1.001, 95% CI 1.001–1.002), 1 $\mu$g/m3 increase NO2 (effect size = 1.014, 95% CI 1.011–1.016), particulate matter with diameter <10 $\mu$m (PM10; effect size = 1.005, 95% CI 1.003–1.008), PM2.5 (effect size = 1.003, 95% CI 1.002–1.004), and SO2 (effect size = 1.015, 95% CI 1.007–1.023).
Conclusions
Outdoor air pollutants are detrimental factors to COVID-19 outcomes. Measurements beneficial to reducing pollutant levels might also reduce the burden of the pandemic.},

Both linear and non-linear relationships were explored. The nonlinear association between weekly confirmed cases and short-term exposure to predictor factors was investigated using a generalized additive model (GAM). The preliminary results indicate that there was a significant association between humidity and weekly confirmed COVID-19 cases. The cooler temperatures had a positive correlation with the occurrence of new confirmed cases. The low PM2.5 concentrations had a negative correlation with the number of new cases, while reducing SO2 concentrations may help decrease the number of new cases. This is the first study investigating the relationship between measured air pollutants, meteorological factors, and the number of weekly confirmed COVID-19 cases across Turkey. There are several limitations of the presented study, however, the preliminary results show that there is a need to understand the impacts of regional air quality parameters and meteorological factors on the transmission of the virus.},

abstract = {In 2020 North Italy suffered the SARS-CoV-2-related pandemic with a high number of deaths and hospitalization. The effect of atmospheric parameters on the amount of hospital admissions (temperature, solar radiation, particulate matter, relative humidity and wind speed) is studied through about 8 months (May–December). Two periods are considered depending on different conditions: a) low incidence of COVID-19 and very few regulations concerning personal mobility and protection (“free/summer period”); b) increasing incidence of disease, social restrictions and use of personal protections (“confined/autumn period”). The “hospitalized people in medical area wards/100000 residents” was used as a reliable measure of COVID-19 spreading and load on the sanitary system. We developed a chemometric approach (multiple linear regression analysis) using the daily incidence of hospitalizations as a function of the single independent variables and of their products (interactions). Eight administrative domains were considered (altogether 26 million inhabitants) to account for relatively homogeneous territorial and social conditions. The obtained models very significantly match the daily variation of hospitalizations, during the two periods. Under the confined/autumn period, the effect of non-pharmacologic measures (social distances, personal protection, etc.) possibly attenuates the virus diffusion despite environmental factors. On the contrary, in the free/summer conditions the effects of atmospheric parameters are very significant through all the areas. Particulate matter matches the growth of hospitalizations in areas with low chronic particulate pollution. Fewer hospitalizations strongly correspond to higher temperature and solar radiation. Relative humidity plays the same role, but with a lesser extent. The interaction between solar radiation and high temperature is also highly significant and represents surprising evidence. The solar radiation alone and combined with high temperature exert an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect, via both the direct inactivation of virions and the stimulation of vitamin D synthesis, improving immune system function.},

abstract = {In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most countries implemented public health ordinances that resulted in restricted mobility and a resultant change in air quality. This has provided an opportunity to quantify the extent to which carbon-based transport and industrial activity affect air quality. However, quantification of these complex effects has proven to be difficult, depending on the stringency of restrictions, country-specific emission source profiles, long-term trends and meteorological effects on atmospheric chemistry, emission levels and in-flow from nearby countries. In this study, confounding factors were disentangled for a direct comparison of pandemic-related reductions in absolute pollutions levels, globally. The non-linear relationships between atmospheric processes and daily ground-level NO2, PM10, PM2.5 and O3 measurements were captured in city- and pollutant-specific XGBoost models for over 700 cities, adjusting for weather, seasonality and trends. City-level modelling allowed adaptation to the distinct topography, urban morphology, climate and atmospheric conditions for each city, individually, as the weather variables that were most predictive varied across cities. Pollution forecasts for 2020 in absence of a pandemic were generated based on weather and formed an ensemble for country-level pollution reductions. Findings were robust to modelling assumptions and consistent with various published case studies. NO2 reduced most in China, Europe and India, following severe government restrictions as part of the initial lockdowns. Reductions were highly correlated with changes in mobility levels, especially trips to transit stations, workplaces, retail and recreation venues. Further, NO2 did not fully revert to pre-pandemic levels in 2020. Ambient PM2.5 pollution, which has severe adverse health consequences, reduced most in China and India. Since positive health effects could be offset to some extent by prolonged exposure to indoor pollution, alternative transport initiatives could prove to be an important pathway towards better health outcomes in these countries. Increased O3 levels during initial lockdowns have been documented widely. However, our analyses also found a subsequent reduction in O3 for many countries below what was expected based on meteorological conditions during summer months (e.g., China, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Poland, Turkey). The effects in periods with high O3 levels are especially important for the development of effective mitigation strategies to improve health outcomes.},

The hourly O3 data were collected from ground monitoring stations, as well as retrieved from Sentinel-5 satellite data for showing the changes in O3 levels pre, during, and after lockdown period. The concentration-response function model was applied using relative risk (RR) values and baseline incidence (BI) to assess the O3-related health effects. Compared to 2019, the annual O3 mean concentrations increased by 12.2% in 2020 and declined by 3.9% in 2021. The spatiotemporal changes showed a significant O3 increase during COVID-19 lockdown, and a negative correlation between O3 levels and the number of COVID-19 cases was found (r = − 0.59, p < 0.05). In 2020, the number of hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases increased by 4.0 per 105 cases, the mortality for respiratory diseases increased by 0.7 per 105 cases, and the long-term mortality for respiratory diseases increased by 0.9 per 105 cases. Policy decisions are now required to reduce the surface O3 concentrations and O3-related health effects in Iran.},

This work aims to explore the impact of the pandemic on plastic pollution research by comprehensively assessing the current status and prospects of plastic pollution research before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A collection of publications on the topic of plastic pollution in the Web of Science database concludes that the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the plastic pollution research: (i) The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the trend of plastic pollution publication output. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of publications on the topic of plastic pollution has shown a significant increase trend; (ii) The COVID-19 pandemic has reversed the global research landscape of research on the plastic pollution. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, more and more countries have begun to pay attention to plastic pollution. Before the pandemic, developed countries were global leaders in plastic pollution research. However, during the pandemic, developing countries began to have a significant share in the quality, quantity and international cooperation of publications; (iii) The COVID-19 pandemic has redefined the major hotspots of plastic pollution research. The focus of research has changed significantly since the pandemic. Solving plastic pollution has become a major research content. During the epidemic, in-depth research on microplastics was conducted. The results of mining the publications on plastic pollution show that there is currently no effective solution to plastic pollution caused by the COVID-19. However, given the seriousness of controlling plastic pollution, it is very necessary to continue to carry out more research.},

abstract = {A growing number of studies report associations between air pollution and COVID-19 mortality. Most were ecological studies at the county or regional level which disregard important local variability and relied on data from only the first few months of the pandemic. Using COVID-19 deaths identified from death certificates in California, we evaluated whether long-term ambient air pollution was related to weekly COVID-19 mortality at the census tract-level during the first ∼12 months of the pandemic. Weekly COVID-19 mortality for each census tract was calculated based on geocoded death certificate data. Annual average concentrations of ambient particulate matter <2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) and <10 $\mu$m (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) over 2014–2019 were assessed for all census tracts using inverse distance-squared weighting based on data from the ambient air quality monitoring system. Negative binomial mixed models related weekly census tract COVID-19 mortality counts to a natural cubic spline for calendar week. We included adjustments for potential confounders (census tract demographic and socioeconomic factors), random effects for census tract and county, and an offset for census tract population. Data were analyzed as two study periods: Spring/Summer (March 16-October 18, 2020) and Winter (October 19, 2020–March 7, 2021). Mean (standard deviation) concentrations were 10.3 (2.1) $\mu$g/m3 for PM2.5, 25.5 (7.1) $\mu$g/m3 for PM10, 11.3 (4.0) ppb for NO2, and 42.8 (6.9) ppb for O3. For Spring/Summer, adjusted rate ratios per standard deviation increase were 1.13 (95% confidence interval: 1.09, 1.17) for PM2.5, 1.16 (1.11, 1.21) for PM10, 1.06 (1.02, 1.10) for NO2, and 1.09 (1.04, 1.14) for O3. Associations were replicated in Winter, although they were attenuated for PM2.5 and PM10. Study findings support a relation between long-term ambient air pollution exposure and COVID-19 mortality. Communities with historically high pollution levels might be at higher risk of COVID-19 mortality.},

abstract = {Objective
To study occupational groups and occupational exposure in association with chronic obstructive respiratory diseases.
Methods
In early 2000s, structured interviews on chronic respiratory diseases and measurements of lung function as well as fractional expiratory nitric oxide (FENO) were performed in adult random population samples of Finland, Sweden and Estonia. Occupations were categorized according to three classification systems. Occupational exposure to vapours, gases, dusts and fumes (VGDF) was assessed by a Job-Exposure Matrix (JEM). The data from the countries were combined.
Results
COPD, smoking and occupational exposure were most common in Estonia, while asthma and occupations requiring higher educational levels in Sweden and Finland. In an adjusted regression model, non-manual workers had a three-fold risk for physician-diagnosed asthma (OR 3.18, 95%CI 1.07–9.47) compared to professionals and executives, and the risk was two-fold for healthcare & social workers (OR 2.28, 95%CI 1.14–4.59) compared to administration and sales. An increased risk for physician-diagnosed COPD was seen in manual workers, regardless of classification system, but in contrast to asthma, the risk was mostly explained by smoking and less by occupational exposure to VGDF. For FENO, no associations with occupation were observed.
Conclusions
In this multicenter study from Finland, Sweden and Estonia, COPD was consistently associated with manual occupations with high smoking prevalence, highlighting the need to control for tobacco smoking in studies on occupational associations. In contrast, asthma tended to associate with non-manual occupations requiring higher educational levels. The occupational associations with asthma were not driven by eosinophilic inflammation presented by increased FENO.},

The effects of PM under 10 $\mu$m (PM10) and diesel PM (DPM) on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection were investigated in human two-dimensional lung epithelial cells and human three-dimensional lung organoids mimicking the lung tissue. We evaluated the formation of stress granules, which are important in cellular adaptation to various stress conditions. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of repeated exposure to PM10 and DPM on DNA damage and cell death during viral infection. PM10 and DPM did not cause stress granule formation in the absence of RSV infection but drastically increased stress granule formation and signal transduction during RSV infection in human lung epithelial cells and human lung organoids. Further, repeated exposure to PM10 and DPM caused cell death by severely damaging DNA under RSV infection conditions. Thus, PM10 and DPM induce severe lung toxicity under stress conditions, such as viral infection, suggesting that the effects of PMs under various stressful conditions should be examined to accurately predict the lung toxicity of PM.},

As airborne microbial temporal pattern is most affected by seasonal changes, this paper found: 1) a significant negative correlation of air temperature, Planetary Boundary Layer height, and surface solar irradiance with daily new COVID-19 incidence and deaths; 2) a similar mutual seasonality with climate variables of the first and the fourth COVID-waves from spring seasons of 2020 and 2021 years.

abstract = {The rapid expansion of the natural gas industry to meet the global demand have raised environmental health concerns. Few studies have found that areas with natural gas industrial activity have poor air quality. However, the negative health impacts of ambient air pollution in a natural gas industrial area remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationship between short-term exposure to air pollution and hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among children in a natural gas industrial area in Bintulu, Malaysia. Daily hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among children were collected from a hospital in Bintulu from 2010 to 2019. Data on six air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, O3, and CO) in the study area were obtained from the Department of Environment Malaysia. Quasi-Poisson time series regressions with distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) were applied to explore the associations between ambient air pollution and childhood hospitalisations for respiratory diseases. Stratification analyses were performed by gender and age group to identify the vulnerable populations. A 10 $\mu$g/m3 increased PM2.5 and SO2 was associated with hospital admissions for respiratory diseases among children with the greatest relative risk of RR 1.089 (95% CI 1.001–1.183) at cumulative lag 0–2 days and RR 1.229 (95% CI 1.073–1.409) at cumulative lag 0–6 days, respectively. There was no significant association between short-term exposure of PM10, NO2, CO, and O3 with childhood respiratory hospitalisation. The association between PM2.5 and SO2 exposure and hospital admissions for childhood respiratory diseases in the two pollutants model remained statistically significant. There were stronger associations in younger children aged 0–4 years and girls. This study reveals that short-term exposure to SO2 was associated with a higher risk of respiratory hospitalisations among children in Bintulu than PM2.5. Better air quality control is necessary for children's health living in the natural gas industrial area.},

We investigated the association between ultra-short-term exposure to air pollution and risk of childhood asthma exacerbations. Hourly data on emergency department visits (EDVs) for asthma in children during 2013–2015 in Brisbane, Australia, were obtained. We undertook time-stratified case-crossover analyses to examine the hourly association between exposure to air pollutants (particles with diameter ≤10 $\mu$m (PM10), particles with diameter ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), ozone (O3), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)) and risk of EDVs for asthma after controlling for temperature, relative humidity, public holidays and circulating levels of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. Risk of EDVs for asthma increased within a few hours after exposure to O3 (odds ratio [OR]: 1.170, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.003–1.365) or NO2 (OR: 1.359, 95%CI: 1.049–1.760). The association between O3 exposure and risk of EDVs for asthma was stronger in boys (OR: 1.244, 95%CI: 1.025–1.511) than that in girls (OR: 1.055, 95%CI: 0.818–1.361). The association between NO2 exposure and risk of EDVs for asthma was stronger in school-age children [OR ranged from 1.376 (95%CI: 1.044–1.813) to 3.607 (95%CI: 1.552–8.385) across different lags] than that in preschool-age children, whereas the association between PM10 exposure and risk of EDVs for asthma was greater in preschool-age children [OR ranged from 1.873 (95%CI: 1.022–3.433) to 1.878 (95%CI: 1.028–3.431)] than that in school-age children. We observed an association of risk of EDVs for asthma with daytime air pollution exposure, but not with night-time air pollution exposure.

The lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic affords a unique opportunity to use real observations to explore the O3 formation regime and the effectiveness of NOx emission control strategies. In this study, observations from ground networks during the lockdowns were used to assess spatial disparity of the Ratio of Ozone Formation (ROF) for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) reduction in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China. The health risk model from Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) system in Hong Kong was adopted to evaluate the risk tradeoffs between NO2 and O3. Results show that the levels of O3 increase and NO2 reduction were comparable due to high ROF values in urban areas of central GBA. The ozone reactivity to NO2 reduction gradually declined outwards from central GBA. Despite the O3 increases, the NOx emission controls reduced the Integrated Health Risk (IHR) of NO2 and O3 in most regions of the GBA. When risk coefficients from the AQHI in Canada or the global review were adopted in the risk analyses, the results are extremely encouraging because the controls of NOx emission reduced the IHR of NO2 and O3 almost everywhere in the GBA. Our results underscore the importance of using a risk-based method to assess the effectiveness of emission control measures and the overall health benefit from NOx emission controls in the GBA.},

We analyzed the data of the participants who had been recruited from January 2011 to April 2014 and had responded to the follow-up questionnaires at 6, 12, and 24 months. Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect participants' sociodemographic background and health, such as respiratory symptoms, and parental mental health. Pre- and postnatal pollution levels were estimated using the spatial interpolation technique (ordinary kriging) at children's residential addresses. Land use types surrounding participants' homes were evaluated by performing buffer analysis. Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the effects of risk factors on the frequent occurrence of child respiratory symptoms in children aged 6, 12, and 24 months. We included 228, 360, and 441 children aged 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. Our results indicated that postnatal exposure to PM2.5 and O3 was positively associated with children's respiratory symptoms. Traffic-related land-use types, sports facilities, and commercial land surrounding homes exerted adverse effects on children's respiratory symptoms, whereas the presence of schools in the neighborhood was beneficial. Parental mental health was also associated with children's respiratory symptoms. Postnatal exposure to air pollution and land use types surrounding residences were associated with respiratory health in children aged <2 years.

abstract = {Introduction
Manganese and lead have been cross-sectionally associated with adverse respiratory outcomes in childhood but there is limited data on their combined effects starting in utero. We examined associations between in utero exposure to metals and childhood respiratory symptoms.
Methods
We assessed 633 mother-child dyads enrolled in the Programming Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment, and Social Stressors (PROGRESS) birth cohort in Mexico City. Blood manganese (BMn) and lead (BPb) were measured in mothers at 2nd and 3rd trimester. Ever wheeze, current wheeze and asthma diagnosis were ascertained at 4–5 and 6–7 year visits through the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood survey. Logistic mixed model regression was used to assess the association between prenatal metals and respiratory outcomes in children across the 4–5 and 6–7 year visits. Covariates included mother's age, education and asthma, environmental tobacco smoke, child's sex and assessment time.
Results
In adjusted models, higher 2nd trimester BPb had a significant association with elevated odds of ever wheeze (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.97, 95% CI: 1.05, 3.67). BMn at 2nd trimester was associated with decreased (OR: 0.06, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.35) odds of current wheeze. We did not find any statistically significant associations with 3rd trimester blood metals.
Conclusion
Prenatal exposure to Pb was associated with higher odds of ever wheeze while Mn was negatively associated with odds of current wheeze. These findings underscore the need to consider prenatal metal exposure, including low exposure levels, in the study of adverse respiratory outcomes.},

abstract = {During the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic disease, like several countries, Romania experienced a multiwaves pattern over more than two years. The spreading pattern of SARS-CoV-2 pathogens in the Bucharest, capital of Romania is a multi-factorial process involving among other factors outdoor environmental variables and viral inactivation. Through descriptive statistics and cross-correlation analysis applied to daily time series of observational and geospatial data, this study aims to evaluate the synergy of COVID-19 incidence and lethality with air pollution and radon under different climate conditions, which may exacerbate the coronavirus' effect on human health. During the entire analyzed period 1 January 2020–21 December 2021, for each of the four COVID-19 waves were recorded different anomalous anticyclonic synoptic meteorological patterns in the mid-troposphere, and favorable stability conditions during fall-early winter seasons for COVID-19 disease fast-spreading, mostly during the second, and the fourth waves. As the temporal pattern of airborne SARS-CoV-2 and its mutagen variants is affected by seasonal variability of the main air pollutants and climate parameters, this paper found: 1) the daily outdoor exposures to air pollutants (particulate matter PM2.5 and PM10, nitrogen dioxide-NO2, sulfur dioxide-SO2, carbon monoxide-CO) and radon - 222Rn, are directly correlated with the daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality, and may contribute to the spread and the severity of the pandemic; 2) the daily ground ozone-O3 levels, air temperature, Planetary Boundary Layer height, and surface solar irradiance are anticorrelated with the daily new COVID-19 incidence and deaths, averageingful for spring-summer periods. Outdoor exposure to ambient air pollution associated with radon is a non-negligible driver of COVID-19 transmission in large metropolitan areas, and climate variables are risk factors in spreading the viral infection. The findings of this study provide useful information for public health authorities and decision-makers to develop future pandemic diseases strategies in high polluted metropolitan environments.},

abstract = {Introduction
Air pollution exposure is suspected to alter both the incidence and mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The impact of chronic air pollutant exposure on the incidence and mortality of ARDS from various aetiologies in Europe remains unknown. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of ARDS in a large European region, 90-day mortality being the main secondary outcome.
Methods
The study was performed in the Provence-Alpes-Cote-d'Azur (PACA) region. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and ozone (O3) were measured. The Programme de M{\'{e}}dicalisation des Syst{\`{e}}mes d'Information (PMSI), which captures all patient hospital stays in France, was used to identify adults coded as ARDS in an intensive care unit.
Results
From 2016 to 2018, 4733 adults with ARDS treated in intensive care units were analysed. The incidence rate ratios for 1-year average exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 were 1.207 ([95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.145–1.390]; P < 0.01) and 1.168 (95% CI, 1.083–1.259; P < 0.001), respectively. The same trend was observed for both 2- and 3-year exposures, while only chronic 1- and 2-year exposure NO2 exposures were related to a higher incidence of ARDS. Increased PM2.5 exposure was associated with a higher 90-day mortality for both 1- and 3-year exposures (OR 1.096 (95% CI, 1.001–1.201) and 1.078 (95% CI, 1.009–1.152), respectively). O3 was not associated with either of incidence nor mortality.
Conclusions
While chronic exposure to NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 was associated with an increased ARDS incidence and a higher mortality rate (for PM2.5) in those patients presenting with ARDS, further research on this topic is required.},

abstract = {Background
Epidemiological studies have associated biomass combustion with (respiratory) morbidity and mortality, primarily in indoor settings. Barbecuing results in high outdoor air pollution exposures, but the health effects are unknown.
Objective
The objective was to investigate short-term changes in respiratory health in healthy adults, associated with exposure to barbecue fumes.
Methods
16 healthy, adult volunteers were exposed to barbecue smoke in outdoor air in rest during 1.5 h, using a repeated-measures design. Major air pollutants were monitored on-site, including particulate matter <2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), particle number concentrations (PNC) and black- and brown carbon. At the same place and time-of-day, subjects participated in a control session, during which they were not exposed to barbecue smoke. Before and immediately after all sessions lung function was measured. Before, immediately after, 4- and 18 h post-sessions nasal expression levels of interleukin (IL)-8, IL6 and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF$\alpha$) were determined in nasal swabs, using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Associations between major air pollutants, lung function and inflammatory markers were assessed using mixed linear regression models.
Results
High PM2.5 levels and PNCs were observed during barbecue sessions, with averages ranging from 553 to 1062 $\mu$g/m3 and 109,000–463,000 pt/cm3, respectively. Average black- and brown carbon levels ranged between 4.1-13.0 and 5.0–16.2 $\mu$g/m3. A 1000 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with 2.37 (0.97, 4.67) and 2.21 (0.98, 5.00) times higher expression of IL8, immediately- and 18 h after exposure. No associations were found between air pollutants and lung function, or the expression of IL6 or TNF$\alpha$.
Discussion
Short-term exposure to air pollutants emitted from barbecuing was associated with a mild respiratory response in healthy young adults, including prolonged increase in nasal IL8 without a change in lung function and other measured inflammatory markers. The results might indicate prolonged respiratory inflammation, due to short-term exposure to barbecue fumes.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic in Germany in 2020 brought many regulations to impede its transmission such as lockdown. Hence, in this study, we compared the annual air pollutants (CO, NO, NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5, and BC) in Augsburg in 2020 to the record data in 2010–2019. The annual air pollutants in 2020 were significantly (p < 0.001) lower than that in 2010–2019 except O3, which was significantly (p = 0.02) higher than that in 2010–2019. In a depth perspective, we explored how lockdown impacted air pollutants in Augsburg. We simulated air pollutants based on the meteorological data, traffic density, and weekday and weekend/holiday by using four different models (i.e. Random Forest, K-nearest Neighbors, Linear Regression, and Lasso Regression). According to the best fitting effects, Random Forest was used to predict air pollutants during two lockdown periods (16/03/2020–19/04/2020, 1st lockdown and 02/11/2020–31/12/2020, 2nd lockdown) to explore how lockdown measures impacted air pollutants. Compared to the predicted values, the measured CO, NO2, and BC significantly reduced 18.21%, 21.75%, and 48.92% in the 1st lockdown as well as 7.67%, 32.28%, and 79.08% in the 2nd lockdown. It could be owing to the reduction of traffic and industrial activities. O3 significantly increased 15.62% in the 1st lockdown but decreased 40.39% in the 2nd lockdown, which may have relations with the fluctuations the NO titration effect and photochemistry effect. PM10 and PM2.5 were significantly increased 18.23% an 10.06% in the 1st lockdown but reduced 34.37% and 30.62% in the 2nd lockdown, which could be owing to their complex generation mechanisms.},

abstract = {Short-term exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) are associated with reduced lung function. However, TRAP is a mixture of various gaseous pollutants and particulate matter (PM), and therefore it is unknown that which components of TRAP are responsible for the respiratory toxicity. Using a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), we conducted a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial in which 40 adults were exposed to TRAP for 2 h at the sidewalk of a busy road. During the exposure, the participants wore the PAPR fitted with a PM filter, a PM and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) filter, or a sham filter (no filtration, Sham mode). The participants were blinded to the type of filter in their PAPR, and experienced three exposures, once for each intervention mode in random order. We measured two lung function measures (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] and forced vital capacity [FVC]) and an airway inflammation marker (fraction of exhaled nitric oxide [FENO]) before and immediately after each exposure, and further measured them at different time periods after exposure. We applied linear mixed effect models to estimate the effects of the interventions on the changes of lung function from baseline values after controlling for other covariates. Compared to baseline, exposing to TRAP decreased FEV1 and FVC, and increased FEV1/FVC and FENO in all three intervention modes. The mixed models showed that with the sham mode as reference, lung function and airway inflammation post exposure were significantly improved by filtering both PM and VOCs, but marginally affected by filtering only PM. In conclusion, the VOCs component of TRAP is responsible for the reduction in lung function caused by short-term exposure to TRAP. However, the result needs to be interpreted cautiously before further verified by laboratory experiment using purely isolated component(s) of TRAP.},

abstract = {The Sars-CoV-2 disease (known as COVID-19) has become a global public health emergency. Researchers have been unveiling the transmission mechanisms and disclosing possible contributing factors. Studies have theorized plausible linkage mechanisms between air pollution exposure and COVID-19 infection and have divided the air pollution exposure into two types: long-term exposure and short-term exposure. However, present studies on impacts of short-term exposure have not reached a conclusive result and are mostly focusing on Asian and European countries. In this study, we conduct a nationwide analysis to examine the association between short-term air pollution exposure and COVID-19 infection in the United States. Daily confirmed cases, air pollution information, and meteorological factors at the county level were collected between March 1st and June 30th, 2020. A total of 806 (out of 3143) counties were included in this study, with 554 counties for PM2.5 and 670 counties for ozone (O3), which account for around 2.1 million cumulative confirmed cases, i.e., about 80% of all confirmed cases in the U.S. over the study period. A generalized additive model was applied to investigate the relationship between short-term exposure to PM2.5/O3 and COVID-19 confirmed cases. The statistically significant results indicate that, with every 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in mean pollutant concentration, the number of daily confirmed cases increases by 9.41% (CI: 8.77%–10.04%) for PM2.5 and by 2.42% (CI: 1.56%–3.28%) for O3. The relative risks associated with short-term PM2.5 exposure remain positive after isolating the impacts of long-term exposure. The results of this study suggest that short-term exposure to air pollution, especially to PM2.5, may contribute to the spread and course of the pandemic. This finding has important implications for policymakers and the public to take preventive measures such as staying at home on polluted days while improving ventilation indoors to lower the probability of infection.},

Increasing evidence have associated pneumonia with early exposure to ambient air pollution. However, the role of indoor environmental factors exposure in early life on childhood pneumonia remains unclear.
Objective
To examine the association between indoor environmental factors exposure during different timing windows and childhood pneumonia, and to identify the key indoor factor(s) in different critical window(s).
Methods
A retrospective cohort study of 8689 pre-schoolers was performed in Changsha, China during 2019–2020. Our questionnaire survey was designed to collect information on pre-schooler's outcome and residential environmental exposure containing indoor pollution and allergens during 1 year before pregnancy, pregnancy, first year, and past year. The associations were further estimated stratified by personal exposure level of outdoor NO2, CO, temperature (T) and different covariates. Associations were assessed by multiple logistic regression model in terms of odds ratio (OR) of 95% confidence interval (CI).
Results
Pre-schooler's pneumonia was significantly related with exposure of new furniture, redecoration, mold/damp stains, and mold or damp clothing or bedding exposure during the four periods, with the strongest associations observed during 1 year before pregnancy based on multi-window model, with ORs (95% CI) of 1.27 (1.12–1.44), 1.26 (1.09–1.46), 1.34 (1.14–1.57), and 1.28 (1.05–1.56) respectively. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) including both parental and grandparental smoking were significantly related with increased risk of pre-schooler's pneumonia, and ETS played a more important role in early life, with ORs (95% CI) of 1.17 (1.01–1.36) and 1.19 (1.02–1.39) in pregnancy and first year. Indoor plants particularly nonflowering plants significantly elevated pneumonia risk but only in past year, with ORs (95% CI) of 1.17 (1.05–1.30) and 1.14 (1.03–1.26). Higher pneumonia risk was observed for renovation exposure in pre-birth compared to post-birth, while mold/dampness exerted an accumulative effect with the highest risk for exposure during both pre- and post-birth. Living near traffic road and exposure to high level of traffic-related air pollution and high temperature significantly increased pneumonia risk. Sensitivity analysis found that some sub-groups were more susceptible to pneumonia risk of home environment exposure.
Conclusion
Early life exposure to indoor environmental factors plays an important role in pneumonia development, supporting the hypothesis of “Preconceptional and Fetal Origin of Childhood Pneumonia” and “Developmental Origins of Health and Pneumonia”.},

Results
Globally, the incident cases of LRIs increased from 414,342,866 [95% uncertainty interval (UI):383,529,625 to 449, 086,938]in 1990 to 488,902,504(95% UI: 457,572,987 to 522,635,542)in 2019 with the age standardized incidence rate (ASIR) decreased from 8,276/100,000 persons (95% UI: 7,727 to 8,892) to 6,295/100,000 persons (95% UI: 5,887 to 6,737) between 1990 and 2019. Number of LRIs deaths were 2,493,200 (95% UI: 2,268,184 to 2,736,184) in 2019, a decrease of 24.9% (95% UI: −34.4 to −15.4) in the past 30 years. Meanwhile, the age-standardized death rate (ASDR) declined also from 67/100,000 persons (95% UI: 61 to 73) in 1990 to 34/100,000 persons (95% UI: 31 to 38) in 2019. Moreover, the numbers and age-standardized rates per 100,000 persons of morbidity and mortality varied widely by age, sex, Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) quintiles, and geographical locations in 2019.
Conclusion
LRIs remain a major public health concern . Some differences in age, sex, SDI quintiles, and geographical locations contribute to LRIs-related global health policy development and health system resource optimization.},

The current study aimed to investigate the mediation role of microRNAs on the association between personal PM2.5 exposure and blood pressure and lung function. One hundred and twenty adults (60 truck drivers and 60 office workers) aged 18–46 years were assessed on the June 15, 2008 and at follow-up (1- to 2-weeks later). MicroRNAs were extracted from the peripheral blood samples. Compared to truck drivers, there is a significant increase in FEF25-75, FEV1, and FEV1/FVC and a decrease in PM2.5 in office workers (all p < 0.05). According to the Bonferroni corrected threshold p-value < 6.81 × 10−5 (0.05/734) used, personal PM2.5 data showed a significant positive association with miR-644 after the adjustment for age, BMI, smoking status, and habitual alcohol use. The mediation effect of miR-644 on the association between personal PM2.5 exposure and FEF25-75 [B (95%CI) = −1.342 (−2.810, −0.113)], PEF [B (95%CI) = -1.793 (−3.926, −0.195)], and FEV1/FVC [B (95%CI) = −0.119‰ (−0.224‰, −0.026‰)] was significant only for truck drivers after the adjustment for covariates. There were no similar associations with blood pressure. These results demonstrate microRNAs to potentially mediate association of PM2.5 with lung function. Subsequent studies are needed to further elucidate the potential mechanisms of action by which the mediation effect of microRNAs is achieved with this process.},

abstract = {Forest fires impact on soil, water, and biota resources. The current forest fires in the West Coast of the United States (US) profoundly impacted the atmosphere and air quality across the ecosystems and have caused severe environmental and public health burdens. Forest fire led emissions could significantly exacerbate the air pollution level and, therefore, would play a critical role if the same occurs together with any epidemic and pandemic health crisis. Limited research is done so far to examine its impact in connection to the current pandemic. As of October 21, nearly 8.2 million acres of forest area were burned, with more than 25 casualties reported so far. In-situ air pollution data were utilized to examine the effects of the 2020 forest fire on atmosphere and coronavirus (COVID-19) casualties. The spatial-temporal concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) were collected from August 1 to October 30 for 2020 (the fire year) and 2019 (the reference year). Both spatial (Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression) and non-spatial (Negative Binomial Regression) analyses were performed to assess the adverse effects of fire emission on human health. The in-situ data-led measurements showed that the maximum increases in PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations ($\mu$g/m3) were clustered in the West Coastal fire-prone states during August 1 – October 30, 2020. The average concentration ($\mu$g/m3) of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and NO2 was increased in all the fire states severely affected by forest fires. The average PM2.5 concentrations ($\mu$g/m3) over the period were recorded as 7.9, 6.3, 5.5, and 5.2 for California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington in 2019, increasing up to 24.9, 13.4, 25.0, and 17.0 in 2020. Both spatial and non-spatial regression models exhibited a statistically significant association between fire emission and COVID-19 incidents. Such association has been demonstrated robust and stable by a total of 30 models developed for analyzing the spatial non-stationary and local association. More in-depth research is needed to better understand the complex relationship between forest fire emission and human health.},

abstract = {There is an increasing evidence that meteorological (temperature, relative humidity, dew) and air quality indicators (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO) are affecting the COVID-19 transmission rate and the number of deaths in many countries around the globe. However, there are contradictory results due to limited observations of these parameters and absence of conclusive evidence on such relationships in cold or hot arid tropical and subtropical desert climate of Gulf region. This is the first study exploring the relationships of the meteorological (temperature, relative humidity, and dew) and air quality indicators (PM10,CO, and SO2) with daily COVID-19 infections and death cases for a period of six months (1st March to August 31, 2020) in six selected cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by using generalized additive model. The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to assess factors affecting the infections rate and deaths through the selection of best model whereas overfitting of multivariate model was avoided by using cross-validation. Spearman correlation indicated that exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) temperature and relative humidity (R > 0.5, P < 0.0001) are the main variables affecting the daily COVID-19 infections and deaths. EWMA temperature and relative humidity showed non linear relationships with the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths (DF > 1, P < 0.0001). Daily COVID-19 infections showed a positive relationship at temperature between 23 and 34.5 °C and relative humidity ranging from 30 to 60%; a negative relationship was found below and/or above these ranges. Similarly, the number of deaths had a positive relationship at temperature ˃28.7 °C and with relative humidity ˂40%, showing higher number of deaths above this temperature and below this relative humidity rate. All air quality indicators had linear relationships with the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths (P < 0.0001). Hence, variation in temperature, relative humidity and air pollution indicators could be important factors influencing the COVID-19 spread and mortality. Under the current scenario with rising temperature and relative humidity, the number of cases is increasing, hence it justifies an active government policy to lessen COVID-19 infection rate.},

abstract = {Background
An increased incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) among patients with pulmonary diseases exposed to air pollution has been reported.
Objective
To comprehensively investigate the association between pneumonia (PN) and air pollution with PTB through a large-scale follow-up study.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective study using data from the Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital Research Database and the Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Database. We included adult patients with PN, PTB and other comorbidities according to ICD-9 codes. Control subjects without PN were matched by age, sex and ten comorbidities to each PN patient at a ratio of 4:1.
Results
A total of 82,590 subjects were included. The PTB incidence rate was significantly higher in the PN group (2,391/100,000) than in the control group (1,388/100,000). The crude hazard ratio (HR) of PN-associated PTB incidence decreased with time, and the overall 7 years the HR (95% confidence interval; CI) was 1.74 (1.55-1.96). The overall adjusted HR and 95% CI of PN-related PTB in the multivariate Cox regression analysis was 3.38 (2.98-3.84). In addition, there was a cumulative lag effect of all air pollutants within 30 days of exposure. The peak adjusted HRs for PTB were noted on the 3rd, 8th, 12th and 12th days of PM2.5, O3, SO2 and NO exposure, respectively. The overall peak HRs (95% CI) of PM2.5, O3, SO2 and NO were 1.145 (1.139-1.152), 1.153 (1.145-1.161), 1.909 (1.839-1.982) and 1.312 (1.259-1.367), respectively, and there was a synergistic effect with pneumonia on the risk of PTB.
Conclusions
A strong association was found between past episodes of PN and the future risk of PTB. In addition, air pollutants including PM2.5, SO2, O3 and NO, together with previous episodes of PN, had both long-term and short-term impact on the incidence of PTB.},

To account for unobserved heterogeneity in the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 across 25 contiguous districts within Seoul, we adopt a full Bayesian hierarchical approach for the generalized linear mixed models. A formal statistical analysis suggests that there exists a positive correlation between a 7-day lagged effect of PM2.5 concentration and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, which implies an elevated risk of the infectious disease. Conversely, temperature has shown a negative correlation with the number of COVID-19 cases, leading to reduction in relative risks. In addition, we clarify that the random fluctuation in the relative risks of COVID-19 mainly originates from temporal aspects, whereas no significant evidence of variability in relative risks is observed in terms of spatial alignment of the 25 districts. Nevertheless, this study provides empirical evidence using model-based formal assessments regarding COVID-19 infection risks in 25 districts of Seoul from a different perspective.},

In particular, several studies have pointed out significant variations between countries in per-capita mortality. In this work, we investigated the association between COVID-19 mortality with climate variables and air pollution throughout European countries using the satellite remote sensing images provided by the Sentinel-5p mission. We analyzed data collected for two years of observations and extracted the concentrations of several pollutants; we used these measurements to feed a Random Forest regression. We performed a cross-validation analysis to assess the robustness of the model and compared several regression strategies. Our findings reveal a significant statistical association between air pollution (NO2) and COVID-19 mortality and a significant role played by the socio-demographic features, like the number of nurses or the hospital beds and the gross domestic product per capita.},

Air pollution may be a contributing risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, the health effects of co-exposure to multiple air pollutants on OSA patients remain unclear.
Objectives
To assess the joint effect of multi-pollutant on sleep disordered breathing (SDB) parameters in patients with or without OSA and identify the dominant pollutants.
Methods
A total of 2524 outpatients from April 2020 to May 2021 were recruited in this cross-sectional study. Ambient air pollutant data were obtained from the nearest central monitoring stations to participants' residential address. SDB parameters were measured by the ApneaLink devices, including apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), hypopnea index (HI), oxygen desaturation index (ODI), average oxygen saturation (SpO2), percentage sleep time with <90% saturation (T90), and desaturation. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) was applied to evaluate the effects of multiple pollutants.
Results
Significant associations were observed between air pollutants and SDB parameters (including increases in AHI, HI, ODI, and desaturation) among patients with OSA. Co-exposure to air pollutants was positively correlated with AHI, HI, and ODI. PM10 and O3 dominated the effects of pollutant mixtures on OSA, with the highest posterior inclusion probability (PIP) values of 0.592 and 0.640, respectively. Stratified analysis showed that, compared to male patients with OSA, stronger effects on the SDB parameters were observed in female patients. Stronger associations were also found in the warm season than those in the cold season.
Conclusion
Co-exposure to air pollutants was associated with SDB parameters among patients with OSA, PM10 and O3 might play the dominant roles.},

However, the biological mechanisms of adverse oral and respiratory health response to PM2.5 fluctuation have not been well characterized. This study aims to explore the relationships of PM2.5 with airway inflammation, salivary biomarkers and buccal mucosa microbiota. We performed a panel study among 40 college students involving 4 follow-ups from August to October 2021 in Hefei, Anhui Province, China. Health outcomes included fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), salivary biomarkers [C-reactive protein (CRP), cortisol, lysozyme and alpha-amylase] and buccal mucosa microbial diversity. Linear mixed-effect models were applied to explore the cumulative impacts of PM2.5 on health indicators. PM2.5 was positively correlated with FeNO, CRP, cortisol and alpha-amylase, while negatively with lysozyme. Per 10-$\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 was linked to maximum increments in FeNO of 10.71% (95%CI: 2.01%, 19.41%) at lag 0–24 h, in CRP of 7.10% (95%CI: 5.39%, 8.81%) at lag 0–24 h, in cortisol of 1.25% (95%CI: 0.44%, 2.07%) at lag 0–48 h, and in alpha-amylase of 2.12% (95%CI: 0.53%, 3.71%) at lag 0–24 h, while associated with maximum decrement in lysozyme of 0.53% (95%CI: 0.12%, 0.95%) at lag 0–72 h. Increased PM2.5 was linked to reduction in the richness and evenness of buccal microbe and o_Bacillales and o_Bacteroidales were identified as differential microbes after PM2.5 inhalation. Bio-information analysis indicated that immunity system pathway was the most important enriched abundant process altered by PM2.5 exposure. In summary, short-term PM2.5 exposure may impair oral and respiratory health by inducing inflammatory and stress responses, weakening immune function and altering buccal mucosa microbial diversity.},

abstract = {Background
The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been spreading in Germany since January 2020, with regional differences in incidence, morbidity, and mortality. Long-term exposure to air pollutants as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen monoxide (NO), ozone (O3), and particulate matter (<10 $\mu$m PM10, <2.5 $\mu$m PM2.5) has a negative impact on respiratory functions. We analyze the association between long-term air pollution and the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Germany.
Methods
We conducted an observational study in Germany on county-level, investigating the association between long-term (2010–2019) air pollutant exposure (European Environment Agency, AirBase data set) and COVID-19 incidence, morbidity, and mortality rate during the first outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (open source data Robert Koch Institute). We used negative binominal models, including adjustment for risk factors (age, sex, days since first COVID-19 case, population density, socio-economic and health parameters).
Results
After adjustment for risk factors in the tri-pollutant model (NO2, O3, PM2.5) an increase of 1 $\mu$g/m³ NO2 was associated with an increase of the need for intensive care due to COVID-19 by 4.2% (95% CI 1.011–1.074), and mechanical ventilation by 4.6% (95% CI 1.010–1.084). A tendency towards an association of NO2 with COVID-19 incidence was indicated, as the results were just outside of the defined statistical significance (+1.6% (95% CI 1.000–1.032)). Long-term annual mean NO2 level ranged from 4.6 $\mu$g/m³ to 32 $\mu$g/m³.
Conclusions
Our results indicate that long-term NO2 exposure may have increased susceptibility for COVID-19 morbidity in Germany. The results demonstrate the need to reduce ambient air pollution to improve public health.},

Little is known about the acute health impacts of air quality index (AQI) on cardiorespiratory risk factors.
Objectives
To assess the short-term links of AQI with cardiorespiratory risk factors in young healthy adults.
Methods
We performed a longitudinal panel study with 4 repeated visits in 40 healthy young adults in Hefei, Anhui Province, China from August to October 2021. Cardiorespiratory factors included systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). We collected hourly AQI data from a nearby air quality monitoring site. Linear mixed-effects model was applied to assess the effects of AQI on BP and FeNO.
Results
The study participants (75.0% females) provided 160 pairs of valid health measurements with average age of 24 years. The mean AQI level was 44.43 during the study period. There were significant positive associations of AQI with three BP parameters and FeNO at different lag periods. For example, an interquartile range increase in AQI (26.54 unit) over lag 0–24 h was associated with increments of 6.69 mmHg (95%CI: 2.95–10.44), 5.71 mmHg (95%CI: 3.30–8.13), 6.04 mmHg (95%CI: 3.46–8.62) and 5.67% (95%CI: 1.05%–16.05%) in SBP, DBP, MAP and FeNO, respectively. The results were robust after controlling for PM1. We did not find effect modifications by gender, BMI, physical activity, or AQI category level on the associations.
Conclusions
The current findings on associations of AQI with cardiorespiratory factors might add evidence of the acute adverse cardiorespiratory consequences following air pollution.},

The present study confronts this question here by developing a comparative analysis of the effects of COVID-19 pandemic between April–September 2020 (based upon strong control measures) and April–September 2021 (focused on health policy of vaccinations) in Italy, which was one of the first European countries to experience in 2020 high numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals and deaths and in 2021 Italy has a high share of people fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (>89% of population aged over 12 years in January 2022). Results suggest that over the period under study, the arithmetic mean of confirmed cases, hospitalizations of people and admissions to Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in 2020 and 2021 is significantly equal (p-value<0.01), except fatality rate. Results suggest in December 2021 lower hospitalizations, admissions to ICUs, and fatality rate of COVID-19 than December 2020, though confirmed cases and mortality rates are in 2021 higher than 2020, and likely converging trends in the first quarter of 2022. These findings reveal that COVID-19 pandemic is driven by seasonality and environmental factors that reduce the negative effects in summer period, regardless control measures and/or vaccination campaigns. These findings here can be of benefit to design health policy responses of crisis management considering the growth of COVID-19 pandemic in winter months having reduced temperatures and low solar radiations ( COVID-19 has a behaviour of influenza-like illness). Hence, findings here suggest that strategies of prevention and control of infectious diseases similar to COVID-19 should be set up in summer months and fully implemented during low-solar-irradiation periods (autumn and winter period).},

The preliminary linear regression analysis indicated a negative correlation between altitudes and COVID-19 infection in China. In contrast to environmental factors from low-altitude regions (<1500 m), high-altitude regions (>1500 m) exhibited lower PM2.5, average temperature (AT), and mobility, accompanied by high SO2 and absolute humidity (AH).

abstract = {Background
Studies on the association of greenness with respiratory health are scarce in developing countries, and previous studies in China have focused on only one or two indicators of lung function.
Objective
The study aims to evaluate the associations of residential greenness with full-spectrum lung function indicators and prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Methods
This nationwide cross-sectional survey included 50,991 participants from the China Pulmonary Health study. Lung function indicators included four categories: indicators of obstructive ventilatory dysfunction (FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC); an indicator of large-airway dysfunction (PEF); indicators of small-airway dysfunction (FEF25–75% and FEV3/FEV6); and other indicators. Residential greenness was assessed by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Multivariable linear regression models and logistic regression models were used to analyze associations of greenness with lung function and COPD prevalence.
Results
Within the 500 m buffer, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in NDVI was associated with higher FEV1 (24.76 mL), FVC (16.52 mL), FEV1/FVC (0.38), FEF50% (56.34 mL/s), FEF75% (33.43 mL/s), FEF25–75% (60.73 mL/s), FEV3 (18.59 mL), and FEV6 (21.85 mL). However, NDVI was associated with lower PEF. In addition, NDVI was significantly associated with 10% lower odds of COPD. The stratified analyses found that the associations were only significant in middle-young people, females, and nonsmokers. The associations were influenced by geographic regions.
Conclusions
Residential greenness was associated with better lung function and lower odds of COPD in China. These findings provide a scientific basis for healthy community planning.},

This work aims to evaluate the role of Particulate Matter (PM) in the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing especially on that of PM as a vector for SARS-CoV-2. Exposure to PM has been related to new cases and to the clinical severity of people infected by SARS-CoV-2, which can be explained by the oxidative stress and the inflammatory response generated by these particles when entering the respiratory system, as well as by the role of PM in the expression of ACE-2 in respiratory cells in human hosts. In addition, different authors have detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in PM sampled both in outdoor and indoor environments. The results of various studies lead to the hypothesis that the aerosols emitted by an infected person could be deposited in other suspended particles, sometimes of natural but especially of anthropogenic origin, that form the basal PM.

abstract = {Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) may lead to inflammation and oxidative damage in the oral cavity, which is hypothesized to contribute to the worsening of airway inflammation and asthma symptoms. In this panel study of 43 asthmatic children aged 5–13 years old, each child had 4 clinic visits with a 2-week interval between two consecutive visits. At each visit, saliva samples were collected and subsequently analyzed for interleukin 6 (IL-6) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) as biomarkers of inflammation and malondialdehyde (MDA) as a biomarker of oxidative stress in the oral cavity. At each visit, children were measured for fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) as a marker of pulmonary inflammation. Asthma symptoms of these children were measured using the Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT). We found that an interquartile range (IQR) increase in 24-h average personal exposure to PM2.5 measured 1 and 2 days prior was associated with increased salivary IL-6 concentration by 3.0% (95%CI: 0.2%–6.0%) and 4.2% (0.7%–8.0%), respectively. However, we did not find a clear association between personal O3 exposure and any of the salivary biomarkers, except for a negative association between salivary MDA and O3 exposure measured 1 day prior. An IQR increase in salivary IL-6 concentration was associated with significantly increased FeNO by 28.8% (4.3%–53.4%). In addition, we found that increasing salivary IL-6 concentrations were associated with decreased individual and total C-ACT scores, indicating the worsening of asthma symptoms. We estimated that 13.2%–22.2% of the associations of PM2.5 exposure measured 1 day prior with FeNO and C-ACT scores were mediated by salivary IL-6. These findings suggest that the induction of inflammation in the oral cavity may have played a role in linking air pollution exposure with the worsening of airway inflammation and asthma symptoms.},

abstract = {Back in December 2019, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) started rapidly spreading worldwide, especially in Italy that was among the most affected countries. The geographical distribution of air pollution and Covid-19 mortality in Italy suggested atmospheric pollution as a worsening factor of severe Covid-19 health outcomes. The present nationwide ecological study focused on all 107 Italian territorial areas, aiming to assess the potential association between Particulate Matter concentration, less than 2.5 $\mu$m in diameter (exposure), and Covid-19 mortality rate (outcome) throughout 2020, by looking at 28 potential confounders. A potential positive association between exposure and outcome was observed when performing a multivariate regression analysis with a Negative Binomial model, suggesting that an increase of 1 $\mu$g/m3 in the exposure is associated with an increase of 9.0% (95% CI: 6.5%–11.6%) in the average Covid-19 mortality rate, conditional on all 28 potential confounders. A sensitivity analysis, based on the E-value, shows that a hypothetical unmeasured confounder would have to be associated with both PM2.5 concentration and Covid-19 mortality rate by a rate ratio of at least 1.40-fold each to explain away the exposure-outcome association, conditional on all 28 covariates included in the main analysis model. Moreover, the Observed Covariate E-value (OCE) was reported to provide a contextualization of the E-value on the observed covariates included in the study. The OCE sensitivity analysis shows that a set of unknown confounders similar in size and magnitude to the set of the considered climatic factors could potentially explain away the estimated exposure-outcome association. Consequently, the role of climatic factors in the Covid-19 pandemic is worth of further investigation.},

Controlling the spread of the disease requires a good understanding of the factors (e.g. air pollutants) that influence virus transmission and the conditions under which it spreads. This study analyzed the relationships between COVID-19 cases and both short-term (6-month) and long-term (60-month) exposures to eight air pollutants (NO, NO2, NOx, CO, SO2, O3, PM2.5 and PM10) in Tehran city, Iran, by integrating geostatistical interpolation models, regression analysis, and an innovated COVID-19 incidence rate calculation (Q-index) that considered the spatial distributions of both population and air pollution. The results show that the higher COVID-19 incidence rate was significantly associated with the exposure to higher concentrations of CO, NO, and NOx during the short-term period; the higher COVID-19 incidence rate was significantly related to the exposure to higher concentrations of PM2.5 during the long-term period; while COVID-19 incidence rate was not significantly associated with the concentrations of O3, SO2, PM10 and NO2 in either period. This study indicates that exposure to air pollutants can effect an increase in the number of infected people by transmitting the virus through the air or by predisposing people to the disease over time. The Q-index calculation method developed in this study can be also used by other studies to calculate more accurate disease rates that consider the spatial distribution of both population and air pollution.},

abstract = {Background
Phthalates are synthetic chemicals present in building materials, personal care products and other consumer goods. Limited studies link phthalates to pediatric asthma incidence; however, their effects on respiratory-related outcomes among those with pre-existing asthma remains unclear.
Objective
We examined associations between phthalates and asthma symptoms, healthcare use, lung function, and lung inflammation among children with asthma.
Methods
We collected repeated measures of urinary biomarkers for select phthalates and phthalate replacements (MBzP, MCINP, MCIOP, MCPP, MECPTP, MEHHTP, molar sum of DEHP biomarkers [MECPP, MEHHP, MEHP, MEOHP], MEP, MiBP, MnBP) and asthma symptoms, healthcare utilization, lung function, and inflammation among 148 predominantly low-income Black children (5–17 years) with persistent asthma every 3 months for one year. We used generalized estimating equations to assess associations between biomarker concentrations and asthma-related measures adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, caregiver's education level, presence of smokers in the home, and season. We also considered co-exposures to other contaminants previously associated with asthma morbidity.
Results
We observed consistent positive associations with individual DEHP biomarkers, the molar sum of DEHP, and BBzP with increased odds of asthma symptoms and with healthcare utilization (adjusted Odds Ratio for general asthma symptoms: $\Sigma$DEHP:1.49,95% Confidence Interval, CI:1.08–2.07; BBzP:1.34, CI:1.04–1.73). We observed similar associations between the DEHP phthalate replacement biomarker MEHHTP and most asthma symptoms evaluated; and with select low molecular weight phthalates (DiBP, DBP) and healthcare utilization. Results were similar when controlling for other environmental exposures (e.g., PM2.5, BPA). No associations were observed with lung function or inflammation, and overall, we did not observe consistent evidence of sexually dimorphic effects.
Conclusion
In the present study, we found evidence to suggest that exposure to select phthalates may be associated with asthma symptoms and healthcare utilization. These findings warrant confirmation given the high asthma burden and widespread and disparate phthalate exposures reported among select populations of color.},

abstract = {Introduction
Maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis disruption in pregnancy may contribute to the programming of childhood respiratory disease and may modify the effect of chemical toxins, like lead (Pb), on lung development. Child sex may further modify these effects. We sought to prospectively examine associations between maternal HPA axis disruption, prenatal Pb and childhood lung function and explore potential effect modification by maternal cortisol and child sex on the association between prenatal Pb and lung function outcomes.
Materials and methods
Analyses included 222 mothers and children enrolled in a longitudinal birth cohort study in Mexico City. Maternal diurnal salivary cortisol was assessed in pregnancy; cortisol awakening response (CAR) and diurnal slope were calculated. Blood Pb was measured during the second trimester of pregnancy. Post-bronchodilator lung function was tested at ages 8–11 years. Associations were modeled using generalized linear models with interaction terms, adjusting for covariates.
Results
A higher (flatter) diurnal slope was associated with lower FEV1/FVC ratio ($\beta$: 0.433, 95%CI [-0.766, −0.101]). We did not find any main effect associations between prenatal Pb and lung function outcomes. We report an interaction between Pb and cortisol in relation to FEV1/FVC and FEF25–75% (pinteraction<0.05 for all). Higher prenatal Pb was associated with reduced FEV1/FVC only in children whose mothers had a high CAR. Higher prenatal Pb was also associated with reduced FEV1/FVC and FEF25–75% in mothers with a flatter diurnal slope. A 3-way interaction between prenatal Pb, CAR and sex on FEV1/FVC, indicated that boys born to women with high CAR and higher prenatal Pb levels had lower FEV1/FVC ratios (pinteraction = 0.067).
Conclusions
Associations between prenatal Pb and childhood lung function were modified by disrupted maternal cortisol in pregnancy and child sex. These findings underscore the need to consider complex interactions to fully elucidate effects of prenatal Pb exposure on childhood lung function.},

PM2.5 average levels in all sites exceeded the World Health Organization annual and daily limits, indicating that the ambient air qualities in all sites were unhealthy. Black Carbon (BC), a fingerprint of incomplete combustion, constituted 31–46% of PM2.5. Multi-element analysis of PM indicated that the sulfur, lead, and zinc had substantial contributions to PM2.5, with the highest level found in Valenzuela. Receptor modeling highlighted six important sources: vehicular emissions, biomass burning, industrials, secondary sulfur, sea spray, and fine soil. Among the sources, vehicular emission was the most dominant source, comprising 20–35% of the apportioned sources. An industrial source, predominantly with Zn and Pb, was seen in Valenzuela, contributing about 5.4% of its PM2.5. The health risks of fine aerosol, BC, and major elements were evaluated also in this study. Elements studied showed negligible potential (HQ < 1) to cause non-carcinogenic health effects and very low (<1 × 10−6) carcinogenic health effects to children and adults. The observed trend for carcinogenic risks of PM2.5 in children was Valenzuela > MMDA > NAMRIA while a medium carcinogenic risk was observed for adults at all sites (CR > 1 × 10−5).

Since aerosols are considered one of the routes of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission and may bind to the surface of airborne MPs, we hypothesize that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could be associated with the levels of MPs in the air. Our goal was to quantify the SARS-CoV-2 RNA and MPs present in the total suspended particles (TSP) collected in the area surrounding the largest medical centre in Latin America and to elucidate a possible association among weather variables, MPs, and SARS-CoV-2 in the air. TSP were sampled from three outdoor locations in the areas surrounding a medical centre. MPs were quantified and measured under a fluorescence microscope, and their polymeric composition was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) microspectroscopy coupled with attenuated total reflectance (ATR). The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 was quantified by an in-house real-time PCR assay. A generalized linear model (GzLM) was employed to evaluate the effect of the SARS-CoV-2 quantification on MPs and weather variables. TSP samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 22 out of 38 samples at the three sites. Polyester was the most frequent polymer (80%) found in the samples. The total amount of MPs was positively associated with the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 envelope genes and negatively associated with weather variables (temperature and relative humidity). Our findings show that SARS-CoV-2 aerosols may bind to TSP, such as MPs, and facilitate virus entry into the human body.},

abstract = {Background
Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening condition. Few studies have evaluated the relationship between air pollution and PE, and these results have been inconsistent. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the association between air pollutant exposure and the risk of hospitalization due to PE.
Materials and methods
Daily PE admissions, meteorological data, and ambient pollution data from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2018, were collected in Beijing. A quasi-Poisson regression model combined with time-stratified case-crossover design and a distributed lag nonlinear model was used to determine the effect of air pollutant exposure on PE admission. To examine the stability of air pollutants' effects, multi-pollutant analyses were performed. Stratified analyses by age and sex were further conducted.
Results
There were 5060 PE admissions during the study period, with an estimated incidence of 6.5 per 100,000. PM2.5, PM10, SO2, O3 and CO exposures were significantly associated with elevated risk of PE hospitalization. The highest cumulative risks were observed at a lag of 0–28 days for PM2.5 (relative risk [RR] = 1.056, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.015–1.098), PM10 (RR = 1.042, 95%CI: 1.010–1.075), and CO (RR = 1.466, 95%CI: 1.127–1.906), at a lag of 0–27 days for SO2 (RR = 1.674, 95%CI: 1.200–2.335), and at a lag of 0–4 days for O3 (RR = 1.019, 95%CI: 1.001–1.038). All associations mentioned above except O3 remained significant in multi-pollutant models. Stratified analyses showed that women and those aged ≥65 years people were more sensitive to PM10 and CO exposure than men and those aged <65 years. The effect of PM2.5 exposure was statistically significant in all subgroups.
Conclusions
Exposure to PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and CO showed a positive association with PE hospitalization. High-risk PE groups should take special precautions on days with poor air quality.},

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between short-term ambient CO exposure and hospitalization costs for bronchitis patients in Chongqing, China. Baseline data for 3162 hospitalized bronchitis patients from November 2013 to December 2019 were collected. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the association, delayed and cumulative, between short-term CO exposure and hospitalization costs. Additionally, subgroup analyses were performed by gender, age, season, and comorbidity. Positive association between CO and hospitalization costs for bronchitis patients was observed. The strongest association was observed at lag 015 days, with per 1 mg/m3 increase of CO concentrations corresponded to 5834.40 Chinese Yuan (CNY) (95% CI: 2318.71, 9350.08; P < 0.001) (845.97 US dollars) increment in hospitalization costs. Stratified analysis results showed that the association was more obvious among those males, elderly, with comorbidities, and in warm seasons. More importantly, there was strongest correlation between CO and bronchitis patients with coronary heart disease. In summary, short-term exposure to ambient CO, even lower than Chinese and WHO standards, can be associated with increased hospitalization costs for bronchitis. Controlling CO exposure can be helpful to reduce medical burden associated with bronchitis patients. The results also suggest that when setting air quality standards and formulating preventive measures, susceptible subpopulations ought to be considered.},

abstract = {The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and subsequent spread of the disease COVID-19 became classified as a pandemic in March of 2020, leading to global safety measures introduced to limit the impact of the virus. This combination of safety measures has become commonly referred to as “lockdown”. The associated industry and lifestyle changes led to reductions in the anthropogenic emission of atmospheric pollutants such as black carbon (BC), which is transported from the mid-latitudes into the Arctic during the winter and spring. Measurements of BC and other anthropogenic pollutants are of increasing importance in the Arctic due to the rapid warming observed there in the past few decades. It is believed that BC has a significant role in this warming, and so understanding the Arctic's response to reduced BC emissions at lower latitudes will provide insight into how future changes might mitigate further warming. Reductions in BC have been reported worldwide, and so in this study, the impact of these reductions on BC concentrations at the High Arctic site Villum Research Station was investigated. The effect was examined from March 2020, around when global lockdowns began, to June 2020, when the Arctic haze period ended and BC levels were once again low. Firstly, the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) was used to assess this impact on BC concentrations by adjusting global anthropogenic pollution emission inventories to simulate those observed during the lockdown period and comparing the results to a similar model run with standard emission inventories. Secondly, equivalent BC data from an aethalometer at Villum Research Station were analysed, comparing the concentrations during the lockdown period to both aethalometer data from previous years and DEHM results from the lockdown period. It was found that when adjusted DEHM emission inventories were introduced from the 1st of March, the model predicted a reduction in BC concentrations beginning on the 10th of March and reached a 10% reduction by the 1st of April. This reduction fluctuated around 10% until the end of the Arctic haze period. Aethalometer data did not show any significant change from previous years, and no concentration reduction could be concluded from its comparison with DEHM results. This is likely because the predicted reduction of 10% is smaller than both the inter-annual and intra-annual variability of measured BC concentrations at Villum.},

We performed stratified analyses for gender and age. Age stratification included <18 years old group, 19–64 years old group and >64 years old group and gender stratification included male group and female group, and then we performed a sensitivity analysis to test the stability of the results. The overall effect values of PM2.5 and PM10 were RR = 1.031 (95%CI: 1.019–1.043) and RR = 1.023 (95%CI: 1.016–1.030), respectively. Estimation for individual cities showed that the strongest association between PM2.5 and the risk of TB outpatient visits was observed in Tongling, with an RR of 1.136 (95%CI: 1.0261–1.2583), also the PM10 in Suzhou, with an RR of 1.0629 (95%CI: 1.0421–1.0842). Stratified analysis showed that particulate matter exposure had a more significant impact on males and the elderly, and that there was little association between particulate matter exposure and TB risk in children and adolescents. Exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 increases the risk of TB outpatient visits. Males and the elderly are vulnerable groups, and different prevention and control strategies should be developed for different groups to reduce the burden of TB.},

abstract = {Air pollution exposure has been found to be associated with epigenetic modification of the mitochondrial genome, which could subsequently induce adverse health outcomes. However, very limited studies exist regarding the association between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure and pulmonary function at the molecular level of mitochondrial epigenetic changes. This study aimed to investigate the association of platelet mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) methylation with occupational PM2.5 exposure and pulmonary function. First, 768 participants were occupationally exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-enriched PM2.5 in a coke-oven plant in East China. The levels of PM2.5, PAH components bound to PM2.5, and urinary PAH metabolites in the workplace environment were measured as an internal dose, respectively. mtDNA methylation was measured by bisulfite pyrosequencing of two genes of ATP synthase (MT-ATP6 and MT-ATP8). Mediation analysis was conducted to evaluate the role of mtDNA methylation in pulmonary alteration induced by PAH. A decreasing trend of platelet mtDNA methylation was observed with increase in PM2.5 exposure across all participants. As an important PAH metabolite in urine, 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) was significantly negatively associated with FEV1/FVC (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1s/Forced Vital Capacity) ratio. The participants with high serum folate levels (≥10 nmol/L) showed positive association between MT-ATP6 methylation and FEV1/FVC ratio. Mediation analysis suggested that MT-ATP6 methylation mediated the significant association of urinary 1-OHP with FEV1/FVC. Our findings suggested the methylation of platelet mitochondrial gene MT-ATP6 and FEV1/FVC to be negatively associated with PM exposure. Platelet mtDNA methylation acted as an intermediary between PAH exposure and lung function decline. The mitochondrial epigenetic regulation in platelets, in response to PM exposure, might be involved in subsequent progress of abnormal pulmonary function.},

However, the cumulative and interactive effects of the mixture of size-fractioned PMs and BC on cardiopulmonary function are not well understood, and the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. This repeated-measure study was conducted to assess the joint cardiopulmonary effect and metabolic mechanisms of multiple-size particles and BC among 46 children. PM0.5, PM1, PM2.5, PM5, PM10 and BC were monitored for 5 weekdays. Cardiorespiratory function measurements and urine samples collection were conducted three times. Untargeted-metabolomics and meet-in-metabolite approach were applied to mechanism investigation. Bayesian machine kernel regression was adopted to analyze associations among PMs, cardiopulmonary function and metabolites. Lung function and heart rate variability significantly decreased with the increased PMs and BC co-exposure (p < 0.05). The effective particles were BC, PM1-2.5 and PM0.5 in turn. No interaction effects of different particles on cardiopulmonary function were observed at different lag days. BC-related glucose and fatty acid increase, and PM1-2.5-related branched-chain amino acid degradation were primarily observed. Other metabolisms were successively disturbed. The greatest joint effects of PMs and BC on metabolism were mainly at lag0 and lag01 day. They occurred earlier than the strongest effects on cardiopulmonary function, which were at lag01 and lag02 day. BC, PM1-2.5 and PM0.5 were mainly associated with cardiorespiratory indices by disturbing amino acids, glucose, lipid, isoflavone and purine metabolism. Mitochondrial productivity and antioxidation reduction are pivotal to the relevant metabolic alterations. More attention should be paid to BC and smaller-size PMs to control indoor PM pollution and its adverse effect on children.},

The study aimed to investigate whether the relationship between short-term temperature exposure and childhood asthma hospitalization was modified by particulate matter (PM). Data on childhood asthma hospitalization, meteorological factors, and air pollutants during 2013–2016 in Hefei, China, were collected. First, a basic Poisson regression model combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model was used to assess the temperature-childhood asthma hospitalization relationship. Then, two interactive strategies were applied to explore the modification effect of PM on the temperature-childhood asthma hospitalization association. We found a greater effect of cold (5th percentile of temperature) on asthma during days with higher PM2.5 (RR: 2.16, 95% CI: 1.38, 3.38) or PM10 (RR: 1.87, 95% CI:1.20, 2.91) than that during days with lower PM2.5 (RR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.06, 2.54) or PM10 (RR: 1.52, 95% CI: 0.98, 2.36). In addition, we observed a greater modification effect of PM2.5 on the cold-asthma association than did PM10, with a per 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase in PM2.5 and PM10 associated with increases of 0.065 and 0.025 for the RR corresponding to the 5th temperature percentile, respectively. For the temperature-related AF, moderate cold showed the largest change magnitude with the PM levels rising compared with other temperature ranges. For the subgroup, Females and those aged 6–18 years were more sensitive to the modification effect of PM2.5 or PM10 on the cold-asthma association. Our findings demonstrated that particulate matter could modify the associations between temperature and childhood asthma hospitalization.},

abstract = {Rationale
Evidence regarding the role of long-term exposure to ultrafine particles (<0.1 $\mu$m, UFP) in asthma onset is scarce.
Objectives
We examined the association between exposure to UFP and asthma development in the Dutch PIAMA (Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy) birth cohort and assessed whether there is an association with UFP, independent of other air pollutants.
Methods
Data from birth up to age 20 years from 3687 participants were included. Annual average exposure to UFP at the residential addresses was estimated with a land-use regression model. Overall and age-specific associations of exposure at the birth address and current address at the time of follow-up with asthma incidence were assessed using discrete-time hazard models adjusting for potential confounders. We investigated both single- and two-pollutant models accounting for co-exposure to other air pollutants (PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentrations, nitrogen dioxide, and PM2.5 absorbance).
Measurements and main results
A total of 812 incident asthma cases were identified. Overall, we found that higher UFP exposure was associated with higher asthma incidence (adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.08 (1.02,1.14) and 1.06 (1.00, 1.12) per interquartile range increase in exposure at the birth address and current address at the time of follow-up, respectively). Age-specific associations were not consistent. The association was no longer significant after adjustment for other traffic-related pollutants (nitrogen dioxide and PM2.5 absorbance).
Conclusions
Our findings support the importance of traffic-related air pollutants for asthma development through childhood and adolescence, but provide little support for an independent effect of UFP.},

Consequently, here we evaluated the status of air quality during the 8th phase of unlocking of COVID-19 lockdown (January 2021) at three locations of North India. The first site (S1) was located at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana-PPCB; the second site (S2) at Yamunapuram, Bulandshahr-UPPCB; and the third site (S3) at Okhla Phase-2, Delhi-DPCC. The levels of PM2.5 showed a significant increase of 525.2%, 281.2%, and 185.0% at sites S1, S2 and S3, respectively in the unlock 8 (January 2021), in comparison to its concentration in the lockdown phase. Coherently, the levels of PM10 also showed a prominent increase of 284.5%, 189.1%, and 103.9% at sites S3, S1, and S2, respectively during the unlock 8 as compared to its concentration in the lockdown phase. This rise in the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 could be primarily attributed to the use of biomass fuel, industrial and vehicular emissions, stubble burning considering the agricultural activities at sites S1 and S2. Site S3 is a major industrial hub and has the highest population density among all three sites. Consequently, the maximum increase (295.7%) in the NO2 levels during the unlock 8 was witnessed at site S3. The strong correlation between PM2.5, PM10, and CO, along with the PM2.5/PM10 ratio confirmed the similar origin of these pollutants at all the three sites. The improvements in the levels of air quality during the COVID-19 lockdown were major overtaken during the various phases of unlocking consequent to the initiation of anthropogenic processes.},

In this study we quantified the associations between residential mobility index (RMI), air pollution, meteorology, and daily cases and deaths of COVID-19 in S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil. We applied a semiparametric generalized additive model (GAM) to estimate: 1) the association between RMI and COVID-19, accounting for ambient particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), relative humidity, temperature and delayed exposure between 4 and 21 days, and 2) the association between COVID-19 and exposure to for ambient particulate matter (PM2.5), ozone (O3), accounting for relative humidity, temperature and mobility. We found that an RMI of 45.28% results in 1212 cases (95% CI: 1189 to 1235) and 44 deaths (95% CI: 40 to 47). Increasing the isolation from 45.28% to 50% would avoid 438 cases and 21 deaths. Also, we found that an increment of 10 $\mu$g⋅m−³ of PM2.5 results in a risk of 1.140 (95% CI: 1.021 to 1.274) for cases and 1.086 (95% CI: 1.008 to 1.170) for deaths, while O3 produces a relative risk of 1.075 (95% CI: 1.006 to 1.150) for cases and 1.063 (95% CI: 1.006 to 1.124) for deaths, respectively. We compared our results with observations and literature review, finding well agreement. Policymakers can use such mobility indices as tools to control social distance activities. Spatial distancing is an important factor to control COVID-19, however, measuring face-mask usage would enhance the understanding the pandemic dynamic. Small increments of air pollution result in an increased number of COVID-19 cases and deaths.},

abstract = {Early life environmental influences such as exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) can disturb molecular processes of lung development and thereby increase the risk for later development of chronic respiratory diseases. Among the latter, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the most common. The airway epithelium plays a key role in their disease pathophysiology but how CS exposure in early life influences airway developmental pathways and epithelial stress responses or survival is poorly understood. Using Drosophila melanogaster larvae as a model for early life, we demonstrate that CS enters the entire larval airway system, where it activates cyp18a1 which is homologues to human CYP1A1 to metabolize CS-derived polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and further induces heat shock protein 70. RNASeq studies of isolated airways showed that CS dysregulates pathways involved in oxidative stress response, innate immune response, xenobiotic and glutathione metabolic processes as well as developmental processes (BMP, FGF signaling) in both sexes, while other pathways were exclusive to females or males. Glutathione S-transferase genes were further validated by qPCR showing upregulation of gstD4, gstD5 and gstD8 in respiratory tracts of females, while gstD8 was downregulated and gstD5 unchanged in males. ROS levels were increased in airways after CS. Exposure to CS further resulted in higher larval mortality, lower larval-pupal transition, and hatching rates in males only as compared to air-exposed controls. Taken together, early life CS induces airway epithelial stress responses and dysregulates pathways involved in the fly's branching morphogenesis as well as in mammalian lung development. CS further affected fitness and development in a highly sex-specific manner.},

For public health surveillance, identification of factors affecting the transmission dynamics concerning the endemic (persistent sporadic) and epidemic (rapidly clustered) component of infection can help to implement intervention strategies to reduce the disease burden. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of long-term residential exposure to outdoor PM ≤ 10 $\mu$m (PM10) concentrations on SARS-CoV-2 incidence and on its spreading dynamics in Marche region (Central Italy) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (February to May 2020), using the endemic-epidemic spatio-temporal regression model for individual-level data. Environmental and climatic factors were estimated at 10 km2 grid cells. 10-years average exposure to PM10 was associated with an increased risk of new endemic (Rate Ratio for 10 $\mu$g/m3 increase 1.14, 95%CI 1.04–1.24) and epidemic (Rate Ratio 1.15, 95%CI 1.08–1.22) infection. Male gender, older age, living in Nursing Homes and Long-Term Care Facilities residence and socio-economic deprivation index increased Rate Ratio (RR) in epidemic component. Lockdown increased the risk of becoming positive to SARS-CoV-2 as concerning endemic component while it reduced virus spreading in epidemic one. Increased temperature was associated with a reduction of endemic and epidemic infection. Results showed an increment of RR for exposure to increased levels of PM10 both in endemic and epidemic components. Targeted interventions are necessary to improve air quality in most polluted areas, where deprived populations are more likely to live, to minimize the burden of endemic and epidemic COVID-19 disease and to reduce unequal distribution of health risk.},

Lung is one of the primary target organs of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and styrene (BTEXS). Small airways dysfunction (SAD) might be a sensitive indicator of early chronic respiratory disease. Here, we explored the relationships between exposure to BTEXS and small airways function, and identified the priority control pollutants in BTEXS mixtures.
Methods
635 petrochemical workers were recruited. Standard spirometry testing was conducted by physicians. The cumulative exposure dose (CED) of BTEXS for each worker was estimated. The peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory flow between 25 and 75% of forced vital capacity (FEF25∼75%), and the expiratory flow rate found at 25%, 50%, and 75% of the remaining exhaled vital capacity (MEF25%, MEF50%, and MEF75%) were measured. SAD was also evaluated based on measured parameters. The associations between exposure to BTEXS individuals or mixtures and small airways function were evaluated using generalized linear regression models (GLMs) and quantile g-computation models (qgcomp). Meanwhile, the weights of each homolog in the association were estimated.
Results
The median CED of BTEXS are 9.624, 19.306, 24.479, 28.210, and 46.781 mg/m3{\textperiodcentered}years, respectively. A unit increase in ln-transformed styrene CED was associated with a decrease in FEF25∼75% and MEF50% based on GLMs. One quartile increased in BTEXS mixtures (ln-transformed) was significantly associated with a 0.325-standard deviation (SD) [95% confidence interval (CI): −0.464, −0.185] decline in FEF25∼75%, a 0.529-SD (95%CI: −0.691, −0.366) decline in MEF25%, a 0.176-SD (95%CI: −0.335, −0.017) decline in MEF75%, and increase in the risk of abnormal of SAD [risk ratios (95%CI): 1.520 (95%CI: 1.143, 2.020)]. Benzene and styrene were the major chemicals in BTEXS for predicting the overall risk of SAD.
Conclusion
Our novel findings demonstrate the significant association between exposure to BTEXS mixture and small airways function decline and the potential roles of key homologs (benzene and styrene) in SAD.},

Therefore, this research aimed to evaluate the effects of biomass-related PM2.5 (BRPM2.5) exposure on 16HBE human airway epithelial cells and in mice with regard to mitochondrial dysfunction. Our study indicated that BRPM2.5 exposure of 16HBE cells resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction, including decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased expression of fission proteins-phospho-DRP1, increased mitochondrial ROS (mtROS), and decreased levels of ATP. BRPM2.5 altered the mitochondrial metabolism of 16HBE cells by decreasing mitochondrial oxygen consumption and glycolysis. However, Mitochondria targeted peptide SS-31 eliminated mitochondrial ROS and alleviated the ATP deficiency and proinflammatory cytokines release. BRPM2.5 exposure resulted in abnormal mitochondrial morphological alterations both in 16HBE and in lung tissue. Taken together, these results suggest that BRPM2.5 has detrimental effects on human airway epithelial cells, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, abnormal mitochondrial metabolism and altered mitochondrial dynamics. The present study provides the first evidence that disruption of mitochondrial structure and mitochondrial metabolism may be one of the mechanisms of BRPM2.5-induced respiratory dysfunction.},

Streptococcus pyogenes, also known as Group A Streptococcus (GAS), is a gram-positive opportunistic pathogen that causes a wide range of diseases, especially in children and immunosuppressed individuals. Diesel exhaust particle (DEP), a significant constituent of particulate matter (PM), are considered a prominent risk factor for respiratory illness and circulatory diseases worldwide. Several clinical and epidemiological studies have identified a close association between PM and the prevalence of viral and bacterial infections. This study investigated the role of DEP exposure in increasing pulmonary and blood bacterial counts and mortality during GAS M1 strain infection in mice. Thus, we characterized the upregulation of reactive oxygen species production and disruption of tight junctions in the A549 lung epithelial cell line due to DEP exposure, leading to the upregulation of GAS adhesion and invasion. Furthermore, DEP exposure altered the leukocyte components of infiltrated cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as determined by Diff-Quik staining. The results highlighted the DEP-related macrophage dysfunction, neutrophil impairment, and imbalance in pro-inflammatory cytokine production via the toll-like receptor 4/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling axis. Notably, the tolerance of the GAS biofilms toward potent antibiotics and bacterial resistance against environmental stresses was also significantly enhanced by DEP. This study aimed to provide a better understanding of the physiological and molecular interactions between exposure to invasive air pollutants and susceptibility to invasive GAS infections.},

Using measurements from the 87 participants in the Multicenter Ozone Study of oldEr Subjects (MOSES), we examined whether personal and ambient pollutant exposures before the controlled exposure sessions would be associated with adverse changes in pulmonary and cardiovascular function.
Methods
We used mixed effects linear regression to evaluate associations between increased personal exposures and ambient pollutant concentrations in the 96 h before the pre-exposure visit, and 1) biomarkers measured at pre-exposure, and 2) changes in biomarkers from pre-to post-exposure.
Results
Decreases in pre-exposure forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were associated with interquartile-range increases in concentrations of particulate matter ≤2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5) 1 h before the pre-exposure visit (−0.022 L; 95% CI -0.037 to −0.006; p = 0.007), carbon monoxide (CO) in the prior 3 h (−0.046 L; 95% CI -0.076 to −0.016; p = 0.003), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the prior 72 h (−0.030 L; 95% CI -0.052 to −0.008; p = 0.007). From pre-to post-exposure, increases in FEV1 were marginally significantly associated with increases in personal ozone exposure (0.010 L; 95% CI 0.004 to 0.026; p = 0.010), and ambient PM2.5 and CO at all lag times. Ambient ozone concentrations in the prior 96 h were associated with both decreased pre-exposure high frequency (HF) heart rate variability (HRV) and increases in HF HRV from pre-to post-exposure.
Conclusions
We observed associations between increased ambient PM2.5, NO2, and CO levels and reduced pulmonary function, and increased ambient ozone concentrations and reduced HRV. Pulmonary function and HRV increased across the exposure sessions in association with these same pollutant increases, suggesting a “recovery” during the exposure sessions. These findings support an association between short term increases in ambient PM2.5, NO2, and CO and decreased pulmonary function, and increased ambient ozone and decreased HRV.},

However, limited information is available on the impact of a mixture of PAHs in air-borne PM2.5 on lung function. We conducted a repeated-measures pilot study for four seasons during the period of 2014–2015, monitored the concentrations of 13 PAHs in PM2.5 samples from the outdoor and indoor microenvironments using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry, estimated inhaled dose of PM2.5-bound PAHs based on the outdoor and indoor PM2.5-bound PAHs concentrations as well as individual time-activity diary, and analyzed independent and joint effects of PM2.5-bound 13 PAHs on lung function by linear mixed effect (LME) and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) models, respectively. LME models indicated the negative association of phenanthrene or benzo[a]pyrene with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) or forced vital capacity (FVC) in warm season. BKMR models revealed that an overall negative association of the mixture of 13 PAHs in PM2.5 with FVC, FEV1, PEF or MVV values in warm season but only overall negative association of the mixture of 13 PAHs in PM2.5 with MVV values in cold season. In warm season, young adults with higher exposure to certain PAHs or the mixture of 13 PAHs in PM2.5 showed significant impairment in lung function, implying that health risk assessment of the mixture of PAHs in PM2.5 attributed to PM2.5 from traffic emission.},

abstract = {Inhalation is the most frequent route and the lung is the primary damaged organ for human exposure to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and styrene (BTEXS). However, there is limited information on the risk and dose-effect of the BTEXS mixture on pulmonary function, particularly the overall effect. We conducted a cross-sectional study in a petrochemical plant in southern China. Spirometry and cumulative exposure dose (CED) of BTEXS were used to measure lung function and exposure levels for 635 workers in 2020, respectively. Forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were tested and interpreted as percentages to predicted values [FVC or FEV1% predicted], and FEV1 to FVC ratio [FEV1/FVC (%)]. We found the reduction in FVC% predicted and the risk of lung ventilation dysfunction (LVD) and its two subtypes (mixed and restrictive ventilation dysfunction, MVD, and MVD) were significantly associated with BTEXS individuals. In addition, pulmonary function damage associated with BTEXS was modified by the smoking status and age. Generalized weighted quantile sum (gWQS) regressions were used to estimate the overall dose-effect on lung function damage induced by the BTEXS mixture. Our results show wqs, an index of weighted quartiles for BTEXS, was potentially associated with the reduction in FVC and FEV1% predicted with the coefficients [95% confidence intervals (CI)] between −1.136 (−2.202, −0.070) and −1.230 (−2.265, −0.195). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for the wqs index of LVD, MVD, and RVD were 1.362 (1.129, 1.594), 1.323 (1.084, 1.562), and 1.394 (1.096, 1.692), respectively. Furthermore, xylene, benzene, and toluene in the BTEXS mixture potentially contribute to the development of lung function impairment. Our novel findings demonstrated the dose-response relationships between pulmonary function impairment and the BTEXS mixture and disclosed the potential key pollutants in the BTEXS mixture.},

abstract = {Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic many studies investigated the correlation between climate variables such as air quality, humidity and temperature and the lethality of COVID-19 around the world. In this work we investigate the use of climate variables, as additional features to train a data-driven multivariate forecast model to predict the short-term expected number of COVID-19 deaths in Brazilian states and major cities. The main idea is that by adding these climate features as inputs to the training of data-driven models, the predictive performance improves when compared to equivalent single input models. We use a Stacked LSTM as the network architecture for both the multivariate and univariate model. We compare both approaches by training forecast models for the COVID-19 deaths time series of the city of S{\~{a}}o Paulo. In addition, we present a previous analysis based on grouping K-means on AQI curves. The results produced will allow achieving the application of transfer learning, once a locality is eventually added to the task, regressing out using a model based on the cluster of similarities in the AQI curve. The experiments show that the best multivariate model is more skilled than the best standard data-driven univariate model that we could find, using as evaluation metrics the average fitting error, average forecast error, and the profile of the accumulated deaths for the forecast. These results show that by adding more useful features as input to a multivariate approach could further improve the quality of the prediction models.},

abstract = {Health effects of particulate matter (PM) from aircraft engines have not been adequately studied since controlled laboratory studies reflecting realistic conditions regarding aerosols, target tissue, particle exposure and deposited particle dose are logistically challenging. Due to the important contributions of aircraft engine emissions to air pollution, we employed a unique experimental setup to deposit exhaust particles directly from an aircraft engine onto reconstituted human bronchial epithelia (HBE) at air-liquid interface under conditions similar to in vivo airways to mimic realistic human exposure. The toxicity of non-volatile PM (nvPM) from a CFM56-7B26 aircraft engine was evaluated under realistic engine conditions by sampling and exposing HBE derived from donors of normal and compromised health status to exhaust for 1 h followed by biomarker analysis 24 h post exposure. Particle deposition varied depending on the engine thrust levels with 85% thrust producing the highest nvPM mass and number emissions with estimated surface deposition of 3.17 × 109 particles cm−2 or 337.1 ng cm−2. Transient increase in cytotoxicity was observed after exposure to nvPM in epithelia derived from a normal donor as well as a decrease in the secretion of interleukin 6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1. Non-replicated multiple exposures of epithelia derived from a normal donor to nvPM primarily led to a pro-inflammatory response, while both cytotoxicity and oxidative stress induction remained unaffected. This raises concerns for the long-term implications of aircraft nvPM for human pulmonary health, especially in occupational settings.},

abstract = {Ambient air pollutants are well-known risk factors for childhood asthma and asthma exacerbation. It is unknown whether different air pollutants individually or jointly affect pathophysiological mechanisms of asthma. In this study, we aim to integrate transcriptome and untargeted metabolome to identify dysregulated genetic and metabolic pathways that are associated with exposures to a mixture of ambient and traffic-related air pollutants among adults with asthma history. In this cross-sectional study, 102 young adults with childhood asthma history were enrolled from southern California in 2012. Whole blood transcriptome was measured with 20,869 expression signatures, and serum untargeted metabolomics including 937 metabolites were analyzed by Metabolon, Inc. Participants' exposures to regional air pollutants (NO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5) and near-roadway air pollutants averaged at one month and one year before study visit were estimated based on residential addresses. xMWAS network analysis and joint-pathway analysis were performed to identify subnetworks and genetic and metabolic pathways that were associated with exposure to air pollutants adjusted for socio-characteristic covariates. Network analysis found that exposures to air pollutants mixture were connected to 357 gene markers and 92 metabolites. One-year and one-month averaged PM2.5 and NO2 were associated with several amino acids related to serine, glycine, and beta-alanine metabolism. Lower serum levels of carnosine and aspartate, which are involved in the beta-alanine metabolic pathway, as well as choline were also associated with worse asthma control (p < 0.05). One-year and one-month averaged PM10 and one-month averaged O3 were associated with higher gene expression levels of HSPA5, LGMN, CTSL and HLA-DPB1, which are involved in antigen processing and presentation. These results indicate that exposures to various air pollutants are associated with altered genetic and metabolic pathways that affect anti-oxidative capacity and immune response and can potentially contribute to asthma-related pathophysiology.},

abstract = {Exposure to particulate matter (PM) could increase both susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19 disease. Prior studies investigating associations between PM and COVID-19 morbidity have only considered PM2.5 or PM10, rather than PM1. We investigated the associations between daily-diagnosed COVID-19 morbidity and average exposures to ambient PM1 starting at 0 through 21 days before the day of diagnosis in 12 cities in China using a two-step analysis: a time-series quasi-Poisson analysis to analyze the associations in each city; and then a meta-analysis to estimate the overall association. Diagnosed morbidities and PM1 data were obtained from National Health Commission in China and China Meteorological Administration, respectively. We found association between short-term exposures to ambient PM1 with COVID-19 morbidity was significantly positive, and larger than the associations with PM2.5 and PM10. Percent increases in daily-diagnosed COVID-19 morbidity per IQR/10 PM1 for different moving averages ranged from 1.50% (−1.20%, 4.30%) to 241% (95%CI: 80.7%, 545%), with largest values for exposure windows starting at 17 days before diagnosis. Our results indicate that smaller particles are more highly associated with COVID-19 morbidity, and most of the effects from PM2.5 and PM10 on COVID-19 may be primarily due to the PM1. This study will be helpful for implementing measures and policies to control the spread of COVID-19.},

abstract = {Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid element that causes lung cancer and multiple non-malignant respiratory diseases. The toxicity of arsenic is mediated in part by epigenetic mechanisms, such as alterations in DNA methylation. While increasing studies have highlighted the potential importance of arsenic exposure to DNA methylation patterns and the subsequent risks for arsenic toxicity, there has been little focus on DNA hydroxymethylation—a negative regulation mechanism of DNA methylation. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between genomic DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation and lung injury in arsenicosis populations. First, an increased risk of lung injury and exacerbation of lung function impairment in the arsenicosis population was confirmed. Levels of 5-methylcytosine/deoxycytidine (5 mC/dC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine/deoxycytidine (5 hmC/dC) and 5 hmC/5 mC in genomic DNA of peripheral blood were decreased in the arsenicosis population compared to in the control. Additionally, multivariate logistic regression models showed an increased risk of chest digital radiography (DR) abnormalities when 5 hmC/dC and 5 hmC/5 mC levels were lower (OR = 3.12 and 3.96, all P < 0.001). For 3 years follow-up, regression analysis showed that a decline in 5 hmC/dC was significantly associated with the decline of lung function parameters [forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMEF); $\beta$ = 0.167, 0.122 and 0.073, respectively; all P < 0.05]. Using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, a combination of 5 hmC/5 dC and 5 hmC/5 mC obtained the highest value for distinguishing lung injury in all subjects (AUC = 0.82, P < 0.01). In contrast, in arsenicosis subjects, 5 hmC/dC was better at distinguishing lung injury (AUC = 0.84, P < 0.01). Together, the results revealed that a decrease in genomic DNA hydroxymethylation markers was associated with lung injury in coal-burning arsenicosis populations. Genomic DNA hydroxymethylation could be a novel biomarker for identifying the risk of lung injury caused by coal-burning arsenicosis.},

abstract = {Objectives
Evidence of childhood asthma hospitalizations associated with temperature variability (TV) and the attributable risk are limited in China. We aim to use a comprehensive index that reflected both intra- and inter-day TV to assess the TV-childhood asthma relationship and disease burden, further to identify seasonality vulnerable populations, and to explore the effect modification of PM2.5.
Methods
A quasi-distributed lagged nonlinear model (DLNM) combined with a linear threshold function was applied to estimate the association between TV and childhood asthma hospitalizations during 2013–2016 in Hefei, China. Subgroup analysis was conducted by age and sex. Disease burden is reflected by the attributable fraction and attributable number. Besides, modifications of PM2.5 were tested by introducing the cross-basis of TV and binary PM2.5 as an interaction term.
Results
The risk estimates peaked at TV0-3 and TV0-4 in the cool and the warm season separately, with RR of 1.051 (95%CI: 1.021–1.081) and 1.072 (95%CI: 1.008–1.125), and the effects lasted longer in the cool season. The school-age children in the warm season and all subgroups except pre-school children in the cool season were vulnerable to TV. It is estimated that the disease burden related to TV account for 6.2% (95% CI: 2.7%–9.4%) and 4% (95% CI: 0.6%–7.1%) during the cool and warm seasons in TV0-3. In addition, the risks of TV were higher under the high PM2.5 level compared with the low PM2.5 level in the cool season, although no significant differences between them.
Conclusions
TV exposure significantly increases the risk and disease burden of childhood asthma hospitalizations, especially in the cool season. More medical resources should be allocated to school-age children. Giving priority to pay attention to TV in the cool season in practice could obtain the greatest public health benefits and those days with high TV and high PM2.5 need more attention.},

abstract = {The potential effect of gestational exposure to phthalates on the lung function levels during childhood is unclear. Therefore, we examined this association at different ages (from 4 to 11 years) and over the whole childhood. Specifically, we measured 9 phthalate metabolites (MEP, MiBP, MnBP, MCMHP, MBzP, MEHHP, MEOHP, MECPP, MEHP) in the urine of 641 gestating women from the INMA study (Spain) and the forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and FEV1/FVC in their offspring at ages 4, 7, 9 and 11. We used linear regression and mixed linear regression with a random intercept for subject to assess the association between phthalates and lung function at each study visit and for the overall childhood, respectively. We also assessed the phthalate metabolites mixture effect on lung function using a Weighted Quantile Sum (WQS) regression. We observed that the phthalate metabolites gestational levels were consistently associated with lower FVC and FEV1 at all ages, both when assessed individually and jointly as a mixture, although most associations were not statistically significant. Of note, a 10% increase in MiBP was related to lower FVC (−0.02 (−0.04, 0)) and FEV1 z-scores (−0.02 (−0.04, −0.01) at age 4. Similar significant reductions in FVC were observed at ages 4 and 7 associated with an increase in MEP and MnBP, respectively, and for FEV1 at age 4 associated with an increase in MBzP. WQS regression consistently identified MBzP as an important contributor to the phthalate mixture effect. We can conclude that the gestational exposure to phthalates was associated with children's lower FVC and FEV1, especially in early childhood, and in a statistically significant manner for MEP, MiBP, MBzP and MnBP. Given the ubiquity of phthalate exposure and its established endocrine disrupting effects in children, our findings support current regulations that limit phthalate exposure.},

In this study, we aimed to assess the impact of acute or prolonged exposure to water-insoluble fractions of PM2.5 (PM2.5 particulate) on lung injury and its molecular mechanisms. Balb/c mice were randomly exposed to PM2.5 once (acute exposure) or once every three days for a total of 6 times (prolonged exposure). Lung, BALF and blood samples were collected, and pulmonary pathophysiological alterations were analyzed. Nrf2 knockout mice were adapted to assess the involvement of Nrf2 in lung injury, and transcriptomic analysis was performed to delineate the mechanisms. Through transcriptomic analysis and validation of Nrf2 knockout mice, we found that acute exposure to PM2.5 insoluble particulates induced neutrophil infiltration-mediated airway inflammation, whereas prolonged exposure to PM2.5 insoluble particulate triggered lung fibrosis by decreasing the transcriptional activity of Nrf2, which resulted in the downregulated expression of antioxidant-related genes. In response to secondary LPS exposure, prolonged PM2.5 exposure induced more severe lung injury, indicating that prolonged PM2.5 exposure induced Nrf2 inhibition weakened its antioxidative defense capacity against oxidative stress injury, leading to the formation of pulmonary fibrosis and increasing its susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection.},

abstract = {Black carbon (BC) is one of the main components of ambient particulate matter. Previous studies have suggested that BC is more toxic than PM2.5 (mass concentration of all sub-2.5 $\mu$m particles). One possible reason for the greater toxicity is that BC is typically in a size range which penetrates easily into lung alveoli and BC particles have a large surface area due to their fractal structure. Due to these properties, toxic gaseous compounds can condensate on the surface of BC particles and then be transported effectively into human lungs, causing a large lung-depositing surface area (LDSA) of particles. In this study, we investigated the relationship between BC and LDSA concentrations in street canyon, highway, and harbour environments in the Helsinki Metropolitan area. In all the studied environments, BC and LDSA concentrations were strongly correlated. In the harbour, cases where marine traffic was considered as the main emission source, the average LDSA per BC mass was 2.4–2.7 times higher than in the road traffic environments. This result was linked to a larger lung depositing size of BC, suggesting that condensation and coagulation of other co-emitted compounds can have a major role in the lung deposition of BC. Thus, BC emissions from marine traffic can cause higher exposure of other co-emitted toxic compounds in the human lungs than the road traffic. The fraction of LDSA linked to BC emissions in the street canyon, the highway, and the harbour were 33%, 30%, and 47%, respectively, whereas the fractions of BC mass in PM1 concentration were 14%, 14%, and 7%, respectively. The results show that BC emissions contribute much more to LDSA than to mass concentration, which indicates that the possible strong negative health effects linked to ambient BC mass concentration could be related to the high LDSA concentration.},

abstract = {The main aim of the COVID-19 lockdown was to curtail the person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. However, it also acted as an air quality intervention. The effect of the lockdown has been extensively analysed on NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5, however, little has been done on how total (TPN) and nanoparticle numbers (NPN) have been affected by the lockdown. This paper quantifies the effect of the lockdown on TPN and NPN in the UK, and compares how the effect varies between rural, urban background and traffic sites. Furthermore, the effect on particle numbers is compared with particle mass concentrations, mainly PM10 and PM2.5. Two approaches are used: (a) comparing measured levels of the pollutants in 2019 with 2020 during the lockdown periods; and (b) comparing the predictions of machine learning with measured concentrations using business as usual (BAU) scenario during the lockdown period. P100 (particle size ≤100 nm) increased by 39% at Chilbolton Observatory (CHO) and decreased by 13% and 14% at London Honor Oak Park (LHO) and London Marylebone Road (LMR), respectively. Particles from 101 to 200 nm (P200) showed a similar trend to P100, however, average levels of particles 201–605 nm (P605) decreased at all sites. TPN, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations decreased at LMR and LHO sites. Estimated PM10, PM2.5 and TPN decreased at all three sites, however, the amount of change varied from site to site. Pollutant concentrations increased back the to pre-pandemic levels, suggesting more sustainable interventions for permanent air quality improvement.},

abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure is a significant cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but the detailed mechanisms involved in COPD remain unclear. In this study, we established PM2.5-induced COPD rat models and showed that PM2.5 induced pulmonary microvascular injury via accelerating vascular endothelial apoptosis, increasing vascular permeability, and reducing angiogenesis, thereby contributing to COPD development. Moreover, microvascular injury in COPD was validated by measurements of plasma endothelial microparticles (EMPs) and serum VEGF in COPD patients. We then performed m6A sequencing, which confirmed that altered N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification was induced by PM2.5 exposure. The results of a series of experiments demonstrated that the expression of methyltransferase-like protein 16 (METTL16), an m6A regulator, was upregulated in PM2.5-induced COPD rats, while the expression of other regulators did not differ upon PM2.5-induction. To clarify the regulatory effect of METTL16-mediated m6A modification induced by PM2.5 on pulmonary microvascular injury, cell apoptosis, permeability, and tube formation, the m6A level in METTL16-knockdown pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) was evaluated, and the target genes of METTL16 were identified from a set of the differentially expressed and m6A-methylated genes associated with vascular injury and containing predicted sites of METTL16 methylation. The results showed that Sulfatase 2 (Sulf2) and Cytohesin-1 (Cyth1) containing the predicted METTL16 methylation sites, exhibited higher m6A methylation and were downregulated after PM2.5 exposure. Further studies demonstrated that METTL16 may regulate Sulf2 expression via m6A modification and thereby contribute to PM2.5-induced microvascular injury. These findings not only provide a better understanding of the role played by m6A modification in PM2.5-induced microvascular injury, but also identify a new therapeutic target for COPD.},

@article{Coker2022,
abstract = {Background. There is currently a scarcity of air pollution epidemiologic data from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to the lack of air quality monitoring in these countries. Additionally, there is limited capacity to assess the health effects of wildfire smoke events in wildfire-prone regions like Brazil's Amazon Basin. Emerging low-cost air quality sensors may have the potential to address these gaps. Objectives. We investigated the potential of PurpleAir PM2.5 sensors for conducting air pollution epidemiologic research leveraging the United States Environmental Protection Agency's United States-wide correction formula for ambient PM2.5. Methods. We obtained raw (uncorrected) PM2.5 concentration and humidity data from a PurpleAir sensor in Rio Branco, Brazil, between 2018 and 2019. Humidity measurements from the PurpleAir sensor were used to correct the PM2.5 concentrations. We established the relationship between ambient PM2.5 (corrected and uncorrected) and daily all-cause respiratory hospitalization in Rio Branco, Brazil, using generalized additive models (GAM) and distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM). We used linear regression to assess the relationship between daily PM2.5 concentrations and wildfire reports in Rio Branco during the wildfire seasons of 2018 and 2019. Results. We observed increases in daily respiratory hospitalizations of 5.4% (95%CI: 0.8%, 10.1%) for a 2-day lag and 5.8% (1.5%, 10.2%) for 3-day lag, per 10 $\mu$g/m3 PM2.5 (corrected values). The effect estimates were attenuated when the uncorrected PM2.5 data was used. The number of reported wildfires explained 10% of daily PM2.5 concentrations during the wildfire season. Discussion. Exposure-response relationships estimated using corrected low-cost air quality sensor data were comparable with relationships estimated using a validated air quality modeling approach. This suggests that correcting low-cost PM2.5 sensor data may mitigate bias attenuation in air pollution epidemiologic studies. Low-cost sensor PM2.5 data could also predict the air quality impacts of wildfires in Brazil's Amazon Basin.},

abstract = {RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification regulates the cell stress response and homeostasis, but whether titanium dioxide nanoparticle (nTiO2)-induced acute pulmonary injury is associated with the m6A epitranscriptome and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, the potential association between m6A modification and the bioeffects of several engineered nanoparticles (nTiO2, nAg, nZnO, nFe2O3, and nCuO) were verified thorough in vitro experiments. nFe2O3, nZnO, and nTiO2 exposure significantly increased the global m6A level in A549 cells. Our study further revealed that nTiO2 can induce m6A-mediated acute pulmonary injury. Mechanistically, nTiO2 exposure promoted methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-mediated m6A signal activation and thus mediated the inflammatory response and IL-8 release through the degeneration of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and Mucin5B (MUC5B) mRNAs in a YTH m6A RNA-binding protein 2 (YTHDF2)-dependent manner. Moreover, nTiO2 exposure stabilized METTL3 protein by the lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS)-activated ERK1/2 pathway. The scavenging of ROS with ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) alleviates the ERK1/2 activation, m6A upregulation, and the inflammatory response caused by nTiO2 both in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that m6A is a potential intervention target for alleviating the adverse effects of nTiO2-induced acute pulmonary injury in vitro and in vivo, which has far-reaching implications for protecting human health and improving the sustainability of nanotechnology.},

abstract = {The Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was applied to evaluate the air quality in the coastal city of Kannur, India, during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown. From the Pre1 (March 1–24, 2020) period to the Lock (March 25–April 19, 2020) and Tri (April 20–May 9, 2020) periods, the Kerala state government gradually imposed a strict lockdown policy. Both the simulations and observations showed a decline in the PM2.5 concentrations and an enhancement in the O3 concentrations during the Lock and Tri periods compared with that in the Pre1 period. Integrated process rate (IPR) analysis was employed to isolate the contributions of the individual atmospheric processes. The results revealed that the vertical transport from the upper layers dominated the surface O3 formation, comprising 89.4%, 83.1%, and 88.9% of the O3 sources during the Pre1, Lock, and Tri periods, respectively. Photochemistry contributed negatively to the O3 concentrations at the surface layer. Compared with the Pre1 period, the O3 enhancement during the Lock period was primarily attributable to the lower negative contribution of photochemistry and the lower O3 removal rate by horizontal transport. During the Tri period, a slower consumption of O3 by gas-phase chemistry and a stronger vertical import from the upper layers to the surface accounted for the increase in O3. Emission and aerosol processes constituted the major positive contributions to the net surface PM2.5, accounting for a total of 48.7%, 38.4%, and 42.5% of PM2.5 sources during the Pre1, Lock, and Tri periods, respectively. The decreases in the PM2.5 concentrations during the Lock and Tri periods were primarily explained by the weaker PM2.5 production from emission and aerosol processes. The increased vertical transport rate of PM2.5 from the surface layer to the upper layers was also a reason for the decrease in the PM2.5 during the Lock periods.},

abstract = {Nitrophenols (NPs) are hazardous pollutants found in various environmental matrices, including ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5), agricultural residues, rainwater, wildfires, and industrial wastes. This study showed for the first time the effect of three pure nitrophenols and their mixture on human lung cells to provide basic understanding of the NP influence on cell elements and processes. We identified NPs in ambient PM2.5 and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles generated from the photooxidation of monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the U.S. EPA smog chamber. We assessed the toxicity of identified NPs and their equimolar mixture in normal bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) and alveolar epithelial cancer (A549) lung cell lines. The inhibitory concentration-50 (IC50) values were highest and lowest in BEAS-2B cells treated with 2-nitrophenol (2NP) and 4-nitrophenol (4NP), respectively, at 24 h of exposure. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay showed that 4NP, the most abundant NP we identified in PM2.5, was the most cytotoxic NP examined in both cell lines. The annexin-V/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) analysis showed that the populations of late apoptotic/necrotic BEAS-2B and A549 cells exposed to 3NP, 4NP, and NP equimolar mixture increased between 24 and 48 h. Cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) buildup led to cellular death post exposure to 3NP, 4NP and the NP mixtures, while 2NP induced the lowest ROS buildup. An increased mitochondrial ROS signal following NP exposure occurred only in BEAS-2B cells. The tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester, perchlorate (TMRM) assay showed that exposed cells exhibited collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential. TMRM signals decreased significantly only in BEAS-2B cells, and most strongly with 4NP exposures. Our results suggest that acute atmospheric exposures to NPs may be toxic at high concentrations, but not at ambient PM2.5 concentrations. Further chronic studies with NP and NP-containing PM2.5 are warranted to assess their contribution to lung pathologies.},
