The average mass concentration ratios of PM2.5 to TSP were 0.61 for Gulou sampling site and 0.50 for Pukou sampling site, respectively. Zn, Pb, Mn and Cu were the most abundant elements among the studied metal(loid)s in both TSP and PM2.5. The results of a simple bioaccessibility extraction test of the studied metal(loid)s varied among elements, with Cd, Zn, Mn, Pb and As showing the higher bioaccessibility. The carcinogenic risks of As, Cd, Co, Cr and Ni in both TSP and PM2.5 via dermal contact and inhalation exposure were within the acceptable level (<1 × 10−4) for both children and adults, but there was potential carcinogenic risk posed by Pb via ingestion to children and adults. The hazard index values for all of the studied elements suggested no non-carcinogenic health risks via ingestion and dermal contact, but a potential non-carcinogenic health risk via inhalation to adults. Values of hazard quotient and hazard index indicated the non-carcinogenic risks from the studied metal(loid)s to children via ingestion, dermal contact and inhalation pathways in Nanjing given the present air quality.},

   abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most toxic air pollutants in China. Efforts in assessing population inhalation exposure to PAHs, and its contribution to lung cancer risk for Chinese residents, have been limited due to insufficient data on measured indoor concentrations. A mass-balance model to predict indoor PAH concentrations was developed, along with estimated exposures and attributable lung cancer risks for residents in the Beijing region in 2006, with a 2-stage Monte Carlo simulation framework. The exposures and risks were split into three parts, based on the sources and places of exposure, to estimate the contributions of indoor and outdoor PAH sources and exposures, in order to better understand the source and place pattern of PAH exposure. PAHs bring considerable lung cancer risk to the population of Beijing region. The population attributable fraction (PAF) of lung cancer for Beijing's overall population is 2.99% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71%–4.26%]. Median contribution of indoor exposure to outdoor-originated PAHs (OUT–in) is 78% (CI: 73%–81%) in the overall population, for 97% (CI: 94%–99%) of whom OUT–in is the largest contributor. Rural residents are facing considerable exposure to indoor-originated PAHs (IN–in), which dominates the total exposure in 12% (CI: 2%–24%) of the rural population. This model framework could be used in quantitative comparison of different interventions on exposure to PAHs as well as other airborne pollutants.},

   abstract = {Asian dust (yellow sand) events are a frequent problem throughout Northeast Asia, where they produce a diverse range of health issues and symptoms in humans that have been widely reported. Asian dust includes soil-derived metals, anthropogenic metals, and many other air pollutants at various concentrations, depending on the atmospheric transport route. Here, we investigated the possible causes for the diversity in symptoms produced by Asian dust events, as reported in a questionnaire survey, on the basis of the dust components and estimated trajectories. Nine dust events were recorded and classified into three types on the basis of light detection and ranging (lidar) data: Type 1 events with high counts of non-mineral dust (spherical) particles, Type 2 events with high counts of mineral dust particles in comparison to non-mineral dust particles, and Type 3 events with very low counts of non-mineral dust particles as compared with other Asian dust events during the surveillance period. Ensemble backward trajectory analysis showed that the atmospheric transport route indeed accounted for the differences. Subjective symptom scores showed the greatest increase after exposure to Type 1 events and a decrease after exposure to Type 3 events. A variety of aerosols were detected concurrent with Asian dust events, and the link between health effects in humans and changes in pollutant levels was explored. The results suggest that the components of Asian dust should be considered when investigating related health effects.},

In this study, the main emission sources of 11 particle-phase PAHs listed as carcinogenic and mutagenic agents by the IARC were identified by a risk apportionment method. The contribution of sources to the total concentration of PAHs in the study area was also quantified. A receptor model based on factor and multiple linear regression analyses was applied to estimate the source-specific risk associated to PAH inhalation in an urban background area of a large city (Venice-Mestre, Northern Italy). The proposed approach has discriminated the sources of mutagenic and carcinogenic congeners and their role in determining a serious hazard for human health. Results, interpreted on the basis of seasonal variations and atmospheric conditions, have shown that even though domestic heating is the main source of total PAHs in winter, a background pollution including traffic mainly accounts for the carcinogenic and mutagenic risk during the whole year. The findings of this work and the approach used can be easily applied to other geographic areas and provide useful information for local and regional air pollution control strategies.},

   abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated that elevated concentrations of suspended atmospheric particulate matter (PM) are associated with adverse health effects. In order to minimize the adverse public health effects of atmospheric PM by exposure management, there is a need for a greater understanding of the toxic mechanisms and the components that are responsible for the toxic effects. The aim of this study was to utilize bioassay techniques to investigate these aspects. For this purpose a reporter panel of 9 genetically engineered bacterial (Escherichia coli) strains was composed. Each panel member was designed to report on a different stress condition with a measurable light signal produced by the luciferase enzyme. Toxic mechanisms and components were studied using six anthropogenic PM source samples, including two vehicle combustion particles, three coal fly ash (CFA) samples and an urban dust sample. The most prominent outcome of the panel exposure results were broad panel responses observed for two of the CFA samples, indicating oxidative stress, respiration inhibition and iron deficiency. These responses were relieved when the samples were treated with EDTA, a non-specific metal chelator, suggesting the involvement of metals in the observed effects. Bioavailability analysis of the samples suggests that chromium was related to the toxic responses induced by two of the CFA samples. Oxidative stress was also observed in several samples of ambient atmospheric aerosols and excess metal toxicity in an urban dust sample collected in a parking lot. The reporter panel approach, as demonstrated in this study, has the potential of providing novel insights as to the mechanisms of atmospheric PM toxicity. Furthermore, combining the panel's results with bioavailability data can enlighten about the role of different PM components in the observed toxicity.},

   abstract = {We aimed to investigate the effects of ambient air pollutants on daily mortality in a relatively stable and homogeneous population in Guangzhou, China. Daily mortality, air pollution, and weather data between 2006 and 2009 were collected. The generalized additive model with poison regression was used to estimate the excessive risks (ERs) of air pollutants (PM10, SO2, and NO2) on total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. The effects of lag0–1 were the greatest for total non-accidental and cardiovascular deaths. The increments of 10μgm−3 in SO2, NO2, and PM10 were associated with ERs of 1.54% (95%CI: 1.03–2.06%), 1.42% (95%CI: 1.06–1.78%), and 1.26% (95%CI: 0.86–1.66%) respectively for total non-accidental deaths, and 2.28% (95%CI: 1.40–3.16%), 1.81% (95%CI: 1.20–2.41%), and 1.79% (95%CI: 1.11–2.47%) respectively for cardiovascular deaths. For persons who died from respiratory disease, however, the maximum effects occurred at lag0. The ERs for SO2, NO2, and PM10 were 1.36% (95%CI: 0.23–2.50%), 1.47% (95%CI: 0.66–2.29%) and 0.93% (95%CI: 0.03–1.83%), respectively. The effects of the three air pollutants on mortality were stronger in elderly and in women. The ERs in the present study were higher than those reported in Europe, the U.S., and most other Asian cities. Our findings show relatively higher ERs of daily mortality by ambient air pollutants in the center of Guangzhou, China, compared with estimates in other cities. Further studies with accurate exposure measurement among homogeneous population are needed to evaluate the precise magnitudes of the effects of the air pollutants.},

In this study the monthly average concentration of SO2, NO2, PM10 and the monthly number of people who in hospital because of lower respiratory disease from January 2001 to December 2005 are grouped equidistant and considered as the terms of transactions. Then based on the relational algebraic theory we employed the optimization relation association rule to mine the association rules of the transactions. Based on the association rules revealing the effects of air pollutants on the lower respiratory disease, we forecast the number of person who suffered from lower respiratory disease by the group method of data handling (GMDH) to reveal the risk and give a consultation to the hospital in Xigu District, the most seriously polluted district in Lanzhou. The data and analysis indicate that individuals may be susceptible to the short-term effects of pollution and thus suffer from lower respiratory diseases and this effect presents seasonal.},

   abstract = {Using the data on all live births (∼400,000) and criteria pollutants from the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) between 2000 and 2004, this paper empirically demonstrates how mismatches in the spatiotemporal scales of health and air pollution data can result in inconsistency and uncertainty in the linkages between air pollution and birth outcomes. This paper suggests that the risks of low birth weight associated with air pollution exposure changes significantly as the distance interval (around the monitoring stations) used for exposure estimation changes. For example, when the analysis was restricted within 3 miles distance of the monitoring stations the odds of LBW (births <2500 g) increased by a factor of 1.045 (±0.0285 95% CI) with a unit increase in the average daily exposure to PM10 (in μg m−3) during the gestation period; the value dropped to 1.028 when the analysis was restricted within 6 miles distance of air pollution monitoring stations. The effect of PM10 exposure on LBW became null when controlled for confounders. But PM2.5 exposure showed a significant association with low birth weight when controlled for confounders. These results must be interpreted with caution, because the distance to monitoring station does not influence the risks of adverse birth outcomes, but uncertainty in exposure increases with the increase in distance from the monitoring stations, especially for coarse particles such as PM10 that settle with gravity within short distance and time interval. The results of this paper have important implications for the research design of environmental epidemiological studies, and the way air pollution (and potentially other environmental) and health data are collocated to compute exposure. While this paper challenges the findings of pervious epidemiological studies that have relied on coarse resolution air pollution data (such as county level aggregated data), the paper also calls for time-space resolved estimate of air pollution to minimize uncertainty in exposure estimation.},

Both are minority-dominant, impoverished communities. We collected 24-h integrated personal air samples from 54 WFS residents and 53 CDS residents, with one sample on a weekday and one on a weekend day during the summer and winter seasons of 2004–2006. Ambient air samples from the center of each community were also collected simultaneously during personal air sampling. Toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (TEX) presented higher (p < 0.05) ambient levels in WFS than in CDS, particularly during weekdays. A stronger association between personal and ambient concentrations of MTBE and TEX was found in WFS than in CDS. Fourteen to forty-two percent of the variation in personal MTBE, hexane, benzene, and TEX was explained by local outdoor air pollution. These observations indicated that local sources impacted the community air pollution and personal exposure in WFS. The estimated cancer risks resulting from two locally emitted VOCs, benzene and ethylbenzene, and non-cancer neurological and respiratory effects resulting from hexane, benzene, toluene, and xylenes exceeded the US EPA risk benchmarks in both communities. These findings emphasized the need to address disparity in health risks associated with ambient air pollution for the socio-economically disadvantaged groups. This study also demonstrated that air pollution hot spots similar to WFS can provide robust setting to investigate health effects of ambient air pollution.},

   abstract = {Background: The insecticide chlordecone was extensively used in the French West Indies to control banana root borer. Its persistence in soils has led to the widespread pollution of the environment, and human beings are still exposed to this chemical. Chlordecone has been shown to impair neurological and behavioural functions in rodents when exposed gestationally or neonatally. Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of prenatal and postnatal exposure to chlordecone on the cognitive, visual, and motor development of 7-month-old infants from Guadeloupe. Methods: Infants were tested at 7 months (n=153). Visual recognition memory and processing speed were assessed with the Fagan Tests of Infant Intelligence (FTII), visual acuity with the Teller Acuity Card, and fine motor development with the Brunet-Lezine. Samples of cord blood and breast milk at 3 months (n=88) were analyzed for chlordecone concentrations. Postnatal exposure was determined through breast feeding and frequency of contaminated food consumption by the infants. Results: Cord chlordecone concentrations in tertiles were associated with reduced novelty preference on the FTII in the highly exposed group (β=−0.19, p=0.02). Postnatal exposure through contaminated food consumption was marginally related to reduced novelty preference (β=−0.14, p=0.07), and longer processing speed (β=0.16, p=0.07). Detectable levels of chlordecone in cord blood were associated with higher risk of obtaining low scores on the fine motor development scale (OR=1.25, p<0.01). Conclusion: These results suggest that pre- and postnatal low chronic exposure to chlordecone is associated with negative effects on cognitive and motor development during infancy.},

   abstract = {Background
Cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles improve the burning efficiency of fuel, however, little is known about health impacts of altered emissions from the vehicles.
Methods
Atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE−/−) mice were exposed by inhalation to diluted exhaust (1.7mg/m3, 20, 60 or 180min, 5 day/week, for 4 weeks), from an engine using standard diesel fuel (DE) or the same diesel fuel containing 9ppm cerium oxide nanoparticles (DCeE). Changes in hematological indices, clinical chemistry, atherosclerotic burden, tissue levels of inflammatory cytokines and pathology of the major organs were assessed.
Results
Addition of CeO2 to fuel resulted in a reduction of the number (30%) and surface area (10%) of the particles in the exhaust, whereas the gaseous co-pollutants were increased (6–8%). There was, however, a trend towards an increased size and complexity of the atherosclerotic plaques following DE exposure, which was not evident in the DCeE group. There were no clear signs of altered hematological or pathological changes induced by either treatment. However, levels of proinflammatory cytokines were modulated in a brain region and liver following DCeE exposure.
Conclusions
These results imply that addition of CeO2 nanoparticles to fuel decreases the number of particles in exhaust and may reduce atherosclerotic burden associated with exposure to standard diesel fuel. From the extensive assessment of biological parameters performed, the only concerning effect of cerium addition was a slightly raised level of cytokines in a region of the central nervous system. Overall, the use of cerium as a fuel additive may be a potentially useful way to limit the health effects of vehicle exhaust. However, further testing is required to ensure that such an approach is not associated with a chronic inflammatory response which may eventually cause long-term health effects.},

We investigated whether mother's exposure to potassium (K) and titanium (Ti) components of airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during pregnancy was associated with birth weight or risk of low birth weight (<2500g) for term infants. The study population was 76,788 infants born in four counties in Connecticut and Massachusetts, US, for August 2000–February 2004. Both K and Ti were associated with birth weight. An interquartile range (IQR) increase K was associated with an 8.75% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24–16.8%) increase in risk of low birth weight. An IQR increase in Ti was associated with a 12.1% (95% CI: 3.55–21.4%) increase in risk of low birth weight, with an estimate of 6.41% (95% CI: −5.80–20.2%) for males and 16.4% (95% CI: 5.13–28.9%) for females. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis of first births only, but not adjustment by co-pollutants. Disentangling the effects of various chemical components is challenging because of the covariance among some components due to similar sources. Central effect estimates for infants of African–American mothers were higher than those of white mothers, although the confidence intervals overlapped. Our results indicate that exposure to airborne potassium and titanium during pregnancy is associated with lower birth weight. Associations may relate to chemical components of sources producing K and Ti.},

   abstract = {Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a major air pollutant and has significant impacts upon human health. Few multi-city studies in Asia have examined the acute health effects of SO2. As part of the China Air Pollution and Health Effects Study (CAPES), this study aimed at investigating the short-term association between SO2 and daily mortality in 17 Chinese cities. We applied two-stage Bayesian hierarchical models to obtain city-specific and national average estimates for SO2. In each city, we used Poisson regression models incorporating natural spline smoothing functions to adjust for long-term and seasonal trend of mortality, as well as other time-varying covariates. We examined the associations by age, gender and education status. As a result, the combined analysis showed that an increase of 10μg/m3 of two-day moving averaged SO2 was associated with 0.75% [95% posterior interval (PI), 0.47 to 1.02], 0.83% (0.95% PI, 0.47 to 1.19) and 1.25% (95% PI, 0.78 to 1.73) increase of total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, respectively. The effects of SO2 appeared more evident among the elderly. These associations were generally independent of particles with aerodynamic diameter <10μm (PM10) but did not persist after adjustment for nitrogen dioxide (NO2). In conclusions, this largest epidemiologic study of air pollution in China to date suggests that short-term exposure to SO2 is associated with increased mortality risk; however, these associations may be attributable to SO2 serving as a surrogate of other substances. Further studies are needed to tackle the independent health effect of SO2.},

Our objective was to investigate the correlation between air pollution and acute manifestations of blepharitis. Method: We recorded all cases of changes in the eyelids and ocular surface, and rated clinical findings on a scale from zero (normal) to two (severe alterations). Daily values of carbon monoxide, particulate matter smaller than 10μm in diameter and nitrogen dioxide concentrations and meteorological variables (temperature and relative humidity) in the vicinity of the medical service were obtained. Specific linear regression models for each outcome were constructed including pollutants as independent variables (single pollutant models). Temperature and humidity were included as confounding variables. Results: increases of 28.8μg/m3 in the concentration of particulate matter and 1.1ppm in the concentration of CO were associated with increases in cases of blepharitis on the day of exposure (5 cases, 95% CI: 1–10 and 6 cases, 95% CI: 1–12, respectively). Conclusion: Exposure to usual air pollutants concentrations present in large cities affects, in a consistent manner, the eyes of residents contributing to the increasing incidence of diseases of the eyelid margin.},

The values of concentration diagnostic ratios indicated a mixture of vehicular emissions, fuel evaporation, oil residues and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in outdoor and indoor samples. Particulate iso/anteiso-alkanes, specific tracers of ETS, were detected in both non-smoking and smoking households. The indoor-to-outdoor ratios of particulate iso/anteiso-alkanes and unresolved complex mixture (a tracer of outdoor air pollution) in non-smoking households were comparable to the measured air exchange rate. This suggested that penetration of outdoor air was solely responsible for the detection of tobacco smoke particulate tracers in indoor non-smoking environments. Overall, residential outdoor concentrations accounted for a large fraction (from 25 up to 79%) of indoor aliphatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Open windows/doors and the operation of an air condition unit yielded also in higher indoor concentrations than those measured outdoors.},

   abstract = {Background
Few studies have examined the acute cardiorespiratory effects of specific volatile organic compound (VOC) exposures from traffic pollution.
Methods
A cross-over study was conducted among 42 healthy adults during summer 2010 in Ottawa, Canada. Participants cycled for 1-h along high and low-traffic routes and VOC exposures were determined along each route. Lung function, exhaled nitric oxide, and heart rate variability were monitored before cycling and 1–4h after the start of cycling. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to examine the relationship between 26 VOCs and acute changes in clinical outcomes adjusted for potential confounding factors.
Results
Each inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in propane/butane exposure was associated with a 2.0millisecond (ms) (95% CI: 0.65, 3.2) increase in SDNN (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals), a 24ms2 (95% CI: 6.6, 41) increase in HF (high frequency power), and a 65ms2 (95% CI: 11, 118) increase in LF (low frequency power) in the hours following cycling. IQR increases in ethane and isoprene were associated with a 5.8ms (95% CI: −9.8, −1.7): decrease in SDNN and a 24ms2 (95% CI: −44, −7.9) decrease in HF, respectively. IQR increases in benzene exposure were associated with a 1.7ppb (95% CI: 1.1, 2.3) increase in exhaled nitric oxide and each IQR increase in 3-methylhexane exposure was associated with a 102mL (95% CI: −157, −47) decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1-s.
Conclusions
Exposure to traffic-related VOCs may contribute to acute changes in lung function, inflammation, or heart rate variability.},

Exposure to high levels of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5μm (PM2.5) resulting from biomass burning is frequent in the subequatorial Amazon region.
Objective
To investigate whether or not current exposure to PM2.5 in the Brazilian Amazon has adverse effects on the daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) of schoolchildren.
Methods
The study design consisted of a panel comprising 309 children aged 6 to 15 years from the same school. PEF was measured daily, except weekends and holidays, from August to December 2006. Each child contributed to the study up to 67 daily measurements. All together there were 19115 PEF measures. Participation rate was 90%. Daily measurements of PM2.5, temperature, and humidity as well as passive smoking, and subject features were regarded in the statistical analysis. Various exposures of PM2.5 were considered throughout the analysis, among them 24-hour, 12-hour, 6-hour, and 5-hour means. To account for subject responses to confounders, mixed effects models were applied. The effects were evaluated considering air pollution levels on the current day or at 1- or 2-day lags and the averages of 0–1-day lags, 1–2-day lags and 0-, 1-, and 2-day lags.
Results
The 24-hour PM2.5 means ranged from 6.39 to 99.91μg/m3. The adjusted models for the entire group of children revealed adverse effects. For instance, for an increase of 10μg/m3 in PM2.5, the reduction in the PEF average varied between 0.26l/min (95% Confidence Interval (CI): −0.49; −0.04) and 0.38l/min (95% CI: −0.71; −0.04). Restricted to the subgroup of non-asthmatic children, classified as such according to the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire, there was a reduction in the PEF ranging from 0.38l/min (95% CI: −0.63; −0.13) to 0.53l/min (95% CI: −0.90; −0.16) for an increase of 10μg/m3 in PM2.5. There was no significant effect in the asthmatic group. When stratified by time of the day children were at school, the concurrent effects of air pollution on PEF were not significant, whereas the 6-hour exposure from 0am to 5:30am was significant for both morning and afternoon groups. Finally, the 24-hour mean lagged effect was only significant for the afternoon group of children. For an increase of 10μg/m3 in PM2.5, there was a reduction in the PEF that ranged from 0.41l/min (95% CI: −0.76; −0.06) to 0.49l/min (95% CI: −0.91; −0.07).
Conclusion
Exposure to current levels of PM2.5 in the Brazilian Amazon was associated with reductions in the lung function of schoolchildren. The adverse effects were more consistent in non-asthmatic children and with respect to the 6-hour mean from 0am to 5.30am.},

   abstract = {Background
Asthma affects more than 17 million people in the United States;1/3 of these are children. Children are particularly vulnerable to airborne pollution because of their narrower airways and because they generally breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults, increasing their exposure to air pollutants. However, the results from previous studies on the association between motor vehicle emissions and the development of childhood wheeze and asthma are conflicting. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify their potential relationship.
Methods
MEDLINE, Highwire, and The Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant studies. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between traffic air pollutants and wheeze or asthma were retrieved from individual studies and pooled to generate summary effect estimates (meta-OR) in STATA 11.1.
Results
Nineteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide (meta-OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00–1.11), nitrous oxide (meta-OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00–1.04), and carbon monoxide (meta-OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01–1.12) were positively associated with a higher prevalence of childhood asthma. Exposure to sulfur dioxide (meta-OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01–1.07) was positively associated with a higher prevalence of wheeze in children. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide was positively associated with a higher incidence of childhood asthma (meta-OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.06–1.24), and exposures to particulate matter was positively associated with a higher incidence of wheeze in children (meta-OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.04–1.07).
Conclusions
Living or attending schools near high traffic density roads exposes children to higher levels of motor vehicle air pollutants, and increases the incidence and prevalence of childhood asthma and wheeze.},

   abstract = {Background
The use of biomass for cooking and heating is considered an important factor associated with respiratory diseases. However, few studies evaluate the amount of particulate matter less than 2.5μm in diameter (PM2.5), symptoms and lung function in the same population.
Objectives
To evaluate the respiratory effects of biomass combustion and compare the results with those of individuals from the same community in Brazil using liquefied petroleum gas (Gas).
Methods
1402 individuals in 260 residences were divided into three groups according to exposure (Gas, Indoor-Biomass, Outside-Biomass). Respiratory symptoms were assessed using questionnaires. Reflectance of paper filters was used to assess particulate matter exposure. In 48 residences the amount of PM2.5 was also quantified. Pulmonary function tests were performed in 120 individuals.
Results
Reflectance index correlated directly with PM2.5 (r=0.92) and was used to estimate exposure (ePM2.5). There was a significant increase in ePM2.5 in Indoor-Biomass and Outside-Biomass, compared to Gas. There was a significantly increased odds ratio (OR) for cough, wheezing and dyspnea in adults exposed to Indoor-Biomass (OR=2.93, 2.33, 2.59, respectively) and Outside-Biomass (OR=1.78, 1.78, 1.80, respectively) compared to Gas. Pulmonary function tests revealed both Non-Smoker-Biomass and Smoker-Gas individuals to have decreased %predicted-forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) as compared to Non-Smoker-Gas . Pulmonary function tests data was inversely correlated with duration and ePM2.5. The prevalence of airway obstruction was 20% in both Non-Smoker-Biomass and Smoker-Gas subjects.
Conclusion
Chronic exposure to biomass combustion is associated with increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms, reduced lung function and development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These effects are associated with the duration and magnitude of exposure and are exacerbated by tobacco smoke.},

Standardised modeling outputs from each group have been shared on the web-distributed ENSEMBLE system, which allows statistical and ensemble analyses to be performed. In this study, the one-year model simulations are inter-compared and evaluated with a large set of observations for ground-level particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and its chemical components. Modeled concentrations of gaseous PM precursors, SO2 and NO2, have also been evaluated against observational data for both continents. Furthermore, modeled deposition (dry and wet) and emissions of several species relevant to PM are also inter-compared. The unprecedented scale of the exercise (two continents, one full year, fifteen modeling groups) allows for a detailed description of AQ model skill and uncertainty with respect to PM. Analyses of PM10 yearly time series and mean diurnal cycle show a large underestimation throughout the year for the AQ models included in AQMEII. The possible causes of PM bias, including errors in the emissions and meteorological inputs (e.g., wind speed and precipitation), and the calculated deposition are investigated. Further analysis of the coarse PM components, PM2.5 and its major components (SO4, NH4, NO3, elemental carbon), have also been performed, and the model performance for each component evaluated against measurements. Finally, the ability of the models to capture high PM concentrations has been evaluated by examining two separate PM2.5 episodes in Europe and North America. A large variability among models in predicting emissions, deposition, and concentration of PM and its precursors during the episodes has been found. Major challenges still remain with regards to identifying and eliminating the sources of PM bias in the models. Although PM2.5 was found to be much better estimated by the models than PM10, no model was found to consistently match the observations for all locations throughout the entire year.},

   abstract = {The rapid increase of the vehicle population makes the transport sector a significant contributor to China’s BC emissions. In this study, we developed an inventory to estimate emissions, reductions, and projections of BC from on-road vehicles. Total emissions of on-road vehicles were 15.0 Gg in 1990 and 64.0 Gg in 2009. Diesel vehicles were the biggest contributor, emitting 83%–95% of total emissions. Results of provincial-level analysis showed that Guangdong, Shandong, and Hebei had higher emissions than other provinces. Emission standards introduced by the government to reduce particulate matter (PM) resulted in decreased BC emissions. Total reductions were up to 375.8 Gg in the period of 1999–2009, equivalent to 270 Tg CO2 (100-year). Projections show that emissions continue to decline from 2010 but start to increase from 2015 under a BAU scenario. If EURO V/VI emission standards are implemented, emissions will decline steadily until 2025. Further reductions of BC can be achieved by using biodiesel and low-sulfur fuels.},

   abstract = {PM10 speciation data from various sites in Switzerland for two time periods (January 1998–March 1999 and August 2008–July 2009) have been analysed for major sources by receptor modelling using Positive Matrix Factorisation (PMF). For the 2008/2009 period, it was found that secondary aerosols (sulphate- and nitrate-rich secondary aerosols, SSA and NSA) are the most abundant components of PM10 at sites north of the Alps. Road traffic and wood combustion were found to be the largest sources of PM10 at these sites. Except at the urban roadside site where road traffic is dominating (40% of PM10 – including road salt), the annual average contribution of these two sources is of similar importance (17% and 14% of PM10, respectively). At a rural site south of the Alps wood combustion and road traffic contributions to PM10 were higher (31% and 24%, respectively), and the fraction of secondary aerosols lower (29%) than at similar site types north of the Alps. Comparison of PMF analyses for the two time periods (1998/1999 and 2008/2009) revealed decreasing average contributions of road traffic and SSA to PM10 at all sites. This indicates that the measures that were implemented in Switzerland and in neighbouring countries to reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide and PM10 from road traffic were successful. On the other hand, contributions of wood combustion did not change during this ten year period, and the contribution of nitrate-rich secondary aerosols has even increased. It is shown that PMF can be a helpful tool for the assessment of long-term changes of source contributions to ambient particulate matter.},

   abstract = {Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and black carbon (BC) emission factors (EF) of 440 on-road diesel trucks were determined by conducting on-road chasing studies in Beijing and Chongqing, China, in the winter 2010. NOx and BC EF distributions are reported. The median NOx EFs for trucks sampled on level roads in Chongqing and Beijing are 40.0 and 47.4g kg-fuel−1, respectively. The median BC EFs are 1.1 and 0.4g kg-fuel−1in Chongqing and Beijing, respectively. In addition, a clear downward trend of BC EFs of on-road diesel trucks sampled in Beijing since 2008 is observed. Moreover, Beijing-registered trucks had the lowest BC EFs among the entire sample. These observations appear to reflect the effectiveness of emission standard and fuel quality standard implemented in Beijing (China IV) and nationwide (China III) in reducing BC (and likely overall particulate matter) emission. However, NOx EFs for Beijing-registered trucks did not show lower value than those from other regions. Unlike black carbon, there is no clear correlation between emission controls and NOx emissions from the sampled on-road trucks. Further analysis shows that trucks with high BC EFs do not usually have high NOx EFs, and vice versa, indicating that the current emission standards implemented in Beijing and nationwide have only limited impact on NOx emissions control. Therefore, effective multi-pollutant control strategies and in-use compliance programs are imperative to reduce the overall emissions from the transportation sector.},

   abstract = {We can control asthma through proper clinical and environmental management and education. The U.S. population is growing, urbanizing and aging; seniors of low-to-middle income families are working and living longer. We conducted community-based participatory research in Visalia, Tulare County, California with a prospective, cross-sectional repeated measures design and quantitative and qualitative process; home environment and health-related outcomes data were collected. In this paper, we presented results of the air quality sampling—pollen, carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulate matter (PM) outdoors away from most major sources (agricultural fields, large pollinating trees, etc)—at a community central site close to a mobile line source and participant homes in the cooling season, July, 2009. Weather was hot and dry with light winds; diurnal variation ranged between 65–107°F (18–42°C) and 12–76% relative humidity at the study’s central site. Co-located active (reference) and passive (PAAS) samplers were used for pollen; passive monitoring for CO2 (Telaire 7001) and active sampling for PM were conducted. Overall, we observed spatial variability in CO2, fine PM (PM2.5), and pollen counts. Weekday and study week average CO2 and PM2.5 concentrations were higher near study homes compared to central site sampling points, but peak measures and overnight/pre-dawn time period averages were elevated at the central site. Pollen counts were typically lower at homes—even if grass, trees, flowers or potted plants were present—compared to the central site closer to and generally downwind from commercial agricultural tree production. Data are new; the nine-county San Joaquin Valley has one pollen count station in the national network, and two of four government outdoor air monitoring stations in the county are in national parks. We suggest—given poor air quality in large part due to PM—adding routine pollen counts to regional/state agency air monitoring sites and more CO2 and PM monitoring.},

   abstract = {In this study, the chemical composition of PM10 at various sites in Switzerland during a one year period in 2008/2009 and changes since the time of a similar characterisation campaign in 1998/1999 are investigated. The concentrations of main components of PM10 were found to be similar at different site types north of the Alps (i.e. urban background, suburban and rural sites). Secondary inorganic PM10 components (nitrate, sulphate and ammonium) constituted the largest PM10 mass fraction, followed by carbonaceous matter (OM and EC), while the abundance of mineral dust and trace elements was small (both <10%). At a rural site south of the Alps the concentrations of secondary inorganic components were much lower and the concentrations of OM and EC clearly higher than north of the Alps. Enhanced concentrations of EC, trace elements and to a lesser extent of OM and mineral dust were found at an urban roadside site. At this site, typical traffic related trace elements like Cu, Fe, Mo, Sb and Ba were highly enriched. This paper indicates clear positive effects of emission reduction strategies for PM10 and precursors implemented during the past ten and more years. The concentrations of sulphate and EC declined during the considered time period, EC reductions were especially strong at the urban roadside site (−2.4μgm−3). In contrast, the concentration of nitrate slightly increased at all of the considered sites (0.2–0.5μgm−3). Large reductions in the concentrations of many trace elements in PM10 during the past ten years are evident. As an example, the observed relative decrease of Pb is about −80%, which is a success of the ban of leaded gasoline in Switzerland and in the EU.},

This study is the first work that reported individual intake fraction of PM2.5 and NOX from vehicle emissions based on personal exposure data in China. We employed PM2.5 and NOX measurement data from 24-h personal exposure sampling and concentration monitoring in traffic environments in the urban area of Beijing to estimate the individual intake fraction (iFi). iFi distributions are presented in microenvironments (traffic, work, home) for adults and children. The individual results are used to calculate the intake fraction for the children group and the adults group in the urban area of Beijing. The iF of PM2.5 for the whole population of these two groups in Beijing is 153 per million, which is significantly higher than those estimates in the United States (1–50 per million) and Mexico (23–120 per million). The iF of NOX is 70 per million, among which the intake in the traffic micro-environment ranks first compared to the iF in the home and office due to a high accumulation of NOX concentration in vehicles. PM2.5 and NOX intake fraction values from vehicle emissions in this study are from at least several times to one order of magnitude higher than those from other industry sources in China. This strongly suggests the health risk from vehicle emissions is significantly higher. Therefore, to protect human health, especially for the large number of people living in the cities of China, controlling vehicle emissions should be the highest priority.},

   abstract = {The rapid increase in anthropogenic nitrogen emissions to the atmosphere is matter of concern for the environment, as these may lead to photochemical air pollution, reduced visibility, eutrophication of surface waters, changes in biodiversity, acid rain, stratospheric ozone depletion, and global warming. In this study, ambient emissions of reactive nitrogen (ammonia and nitrous oxide) from animal and crop farming are analyzed for the base year 2003. This objective was achieved by the systematic development of a spatially resolved emissions inventory on a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform. Emissions of ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were estimated: (i) from livestock; 1705 Gg/yr and 214 Gg yr−1 and (ii) fertilizer applications; 2697 Gg yr−1 and 326 Gg yr−1. These estimated emissions were compared and contrasted with global, U.S., and European emissions of reactive nitrogen; emissions from India were second only to China. From the spatially resolved emission inventory, it was observed that the state of Uttar Pradesh has the highest NH3 emission (522 Gg yr−1) followed by the state of Maharashtra (425 Gg yr−1) both from animal and crop farming. Similarly the State of Uttar Pradesh has the highest N2O emission (70 Gg yr−1) followed by the state of Maharashtra (47 Gg yr−1).},

   abstract = {Episodes of exceptionally high surface ozone (O3) levels were measured in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) from July 6 to July 8. During the episode period, the 1-h average O3 concentration exceeded the daily maximum of 80 ppb over three consecutive days. In order to understand the mechanisms behind the increased O3 concentrations on consecutive days, several numerical experiments were conducted using the atmospheric dynamic model WRF for assessing the atmospheric flow as well as CMAQ for the estimation of the amount of photochemical ozone. Gradually increasing ozone concentration during episode period in SMA depends not only on the variation of meteorological conditions and the emission rate of precursors but also on the accompanying precursors within the air mass recirculation that are emitted from the SMA and its surrounding areas. The impact from the recirculation of precursors responsible for the increased ozone concentration was clarified for numerical studies using the particle dispersion model FLEXPART. Results obtained from our experimental model also demonstrated that recirculated O3 precursors such as nitrogen oxide (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) significantly influenced O3 levels. During the episode period, NOx and VOCs concentrations in the PBL increased by an average of 2.9% and 19.7%, respectively, through recirculation. The recirculated precursors also are involved in the activation of photochemical reactions responsible for the formation of O3, leading to an average increase in the local O3 production of 10.9 ppb. And overall effect due to recirculation is dependent on the actual path and direction of recirculation.},

   abstract = {The impact of ambient temperature on the levels and chemical composition of aerosols over the Eastern Mediterranean in July 2004 is investigated using the WRF/CMAQ model system coupled with the MEGAN biogenic emissions model. CMAQ is able to capture the observed mean aerosol concentrations over the studied period. Non-sea-salt sulfate (nss-SO42−) is calculated to be the major aerosol component contributing by 63%, 16% and 40% to the fine (PM2.5), coarse (PM2.5–10) and total particulate matter mass (PM10), respectively. PM2.5 to PM10 mass ratios reach more than 80% over the large urban agglomerations but decrease to 45% at downwind locations suggesting coagulation and condensation on coarse particles. Higher temperatures increase biogenic emissions, enhance spatially-averaged biogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA, by 0.01 ± 0.00 μg m−3 K−1) and nitrate (NO3−) aerosol concentrations (by 0.02 ± 0.02 μg m−3 K−1). They reduce nss-SO42− (by −0.04 ± 0.07 μg m−3 K−1), induced by significant reduction in the cloud cover (90% K−1) and subsequent aqueous-phase production. The PM2.5 concentrations show a very small positive response to temperature changes, increasing by 0.003 ± 0.042 μg m−3 K−1 (0.04% K−1) due to the compensation of organic carbon increases by nss-SO42− reductions. Locally, larger changes are computed, with nss-SO42− and NO3− in fine aerosols reduced by up to 0.62 μg m−3 K−1 and 0.80 μg m−3 K−1, respectively. Increases as high as 0.097 μg m−3 K−1 and 0.034 μg m−3 K−1 are calculated for organic and elemental carbon, respectively. Results show that changes in temperature modify not only the aerosol mass but also its chemical composition.},

The preliminary conclusion is that when dry haze occurs in the Shanghai vicinity, smoke and maritime aerosols are the major types in summer and autumn and aerosols might be affected by long-distance transport of dust in spring; lower troposphere below 2 km is the layer polluted most severely and aerosol scattering with relatively irregular shape is much stronger than that of aerosols with relatively regular shape within 2–10 km in middle and upper troposphere; relatively large aerosols appear more frequently in lower (0–2 km) and middle troposphere (2–6 km) than those in upper troposphere (6–10 km). In addition, HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) model is applied to analyze the aerosol sources during two typical episodes. The results indicate that the middle and upper troposphere in the Shanghai vicinity are affected by the long-distance transport of dusts from northwest of China or other upstream regions. The high aerosol concentrations in the Shanghai vicinity are mainly caused not only by local human activities but also by the long-distance transport from other places.},

The operation principle of air cleaner based on plasma ion is that hydrogen atoms and oxygen ions combine to form hydroperoxyl radicals (HOO−), which surround and attach to surface of airborne microorganisms and eliminate them by breaking the hydrogen bond in their protein structure. In gaseous pollutants, it was found that there is no reduction effect of the air cleaner on ammonia and hydrogen sulfide (p > 0.05). In particulate pollutants, the air cleaner showed mean 79%(±6.1) and 78%(±3.0) of reduction efficiency for PM2.5. and PM1, respectively, compared to the control without air cleaner (p < 0.05). However, there is no significant difference in TSP and PM10 between the treatment with air cleaner and the control without air cleaner (p > 0.05). In biological pollutants, the mean reduction efficiencies for airborne bacteria and fungi by application of air cleaner were 22%(±6.6) and 25%(±8.7), respectively (p < 0.05). Based on the results obtained from this study, it was concluded that the air cleaner had a positive reduction effect on PM2.5, PM1, airborne bacteria and airborne fungi among airborne pollutants distributed in pig building while it did not lead to significant reduction of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide.},

Analytic methodology was optimized for 23 VOCs (n-alkanes, cycloalkanes, aromatic and chlorinated compounds, ketones and terpenes compounds) by determining the recovery factor and detection limit for each analyte. Different recovery values were obtained by desorbing with a mixture of dichloromethane: methanol (50:50), with a standard deviation lower than 5%. Enterprise analyzed included chemical analysis laboratories, sewing workrooms, electromechanical repair and car painting centers, take away food shops, and a photocopy center. The highest levels of VOCs were found to be in electromechanical repair and car painting centers (hexane, BTEX, CHCl3, CCl4) followed by chemical analysis laboratories and sewing workrooms. Cancer and noncancer risks were assessed using conventional approaches (HQ and LCR, US EPA) using the benzene, trichloroethylene, chloroform for cancer risk, and toluene, xylene and n-hexane, for noncancer risks as markers. The results showed different LCR for benzene and trichloroethylene between the different indoor environments analyzed (electromechanical repair and car painting center≫others) and chloroform (laboratory>others), but comparing with the results obtained by other research, are in similar order of magnitude for equivalents activities. Similar finding were founded for HQ. Comparing these results with the worker protection legislation the electromechanical repair and car painting center and chemical analysis laboratories are close to the limits advised by OSHA and ACGIH. These facts show the importance of the use of abatement technologies for the complete reduction of VOCs levels, to mitigate their impact in the worker’s health and their venting to the atmosphere.},

   abstract = {Accurate monitoring of indoor mass concentrations of particulate matter is very important for health risk assessment as people in developed countries spend approximately 90% of their time indoors. The direct reading, aerosol monitoring device, Turnkey, OSIRIS Particle Monitor (Model 2315) and the European reference low volume sampler, LVS3 (Sven/Leckel LVS3) with size-selective inlets for PM10 and PM2.5 fractions were used to assess the comparability of available optical and gravimetric methods for particulate matter characterization in indoor air. Simultaneous 24-hour samples were collected in an indoor environment for 60 sampling periods in the town of Bor, Serbia. The 24-hour mean PM10 levels from the OSIRIS monitor were well correlated with the LVS3 levels (R2=0.87) and did not show statistically significant bias. The 24-hour mean PM2.5 levels from the OSIRIS monitor were moderately correlated with the LVS3 levels (R2=0.71), but show statistically significant bias. The results suggest that the OSIRIS monitor provides sufficiently accurate measurements for PM10. The OSIRIS monitor underestimated the indoor PM10 concentrations by approximately 12%, relative to the reference LVS3 sampler. The accuracy of PM10 measurements could be further improved through empirical adjustment. For the fine fraction of particulate matter, PM2.5, it was found that the OSIRIS monitor underestimated indoor concentrations by approximately 63%, relative to the reference LVS3 sampler. This could lead to exposure misclassification in health effects studies relying on PM2.5 measurements collected with this instrument in indoor environments.},

   abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most toxic air pollutants in China. Efforts in assessing population inhalation exposure to PAHs, and its contribution to lung cancer risk for Chinese residents, have been limited due to insufficient data on measured indoor concentrations. A mass-balance model to predict indoor PAH concentrations was developed, along with estimated exposures and attributable lung cancer risks for residents in the Beijing region in 2006, with a 2-stage Monte Carlo simulation framework. The exposures and risks were split into three parts, based on the sources and places of exposure, to estimate the contributions of indoor and outdoor PAH sources and exposures, in order to better understand the source and place pattern of PAH exposure. PAHs bring considerable lung cancer risk to the population of Beijing region. The population attributable fraction (PAF) of lung cancer for Beijing's overall population is 2.99% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71%–4.26%]. Median contribution of indoor exposure to outdoor-originated PAHs (OUT–in) is 78% (CI: 73%–81%) in the overall population, for 97% (CI: 94%–99%) of whom OUT–in is the largest contributor. Rural residents are facing considerable exposure to indoor-originated PAHs (IN–in), which dominates the total exposure in 12% (CI: 2%–24%) of the rural population. This model framework could be used in quantitative comparison of different interventions on exposure to PAHs as well as other airborne pollutants.},

   abstract = {Indoor air quality in mosques during prayers may be of concern for sensitive/susceptible sub-groups of the population. However, no indoor air pollutant levels of potentially toxic agents in mosques have been reported in the literature. This study measured PM concentrations in a mosque on Friday when the mid-day prayer always receives high attendance. Particle number and CO2 concentrations were measured on nine sampling days in three different campaigns before, during, and after prayer under three different cleaning schedules: vacuuming a week before, a day before, and on the morning of the prayer. In addition, daily PM2.5 concentrations were measured. Number concentrations in 0.5–1.0, 1.0–5.0, and>5.0μm diameter size ranges were monitored. In all campaigns the maximum number concentrations were observed on the most crowded days. The lowest number concentrations occurred when vacuuming was performed a day before the prayer day in two of the three size ranges considered. PM2.5 concentrations (four-hour samples that integrated before, during, and after the prayer) were comparable to the other indoor environments reported in the literature. CO2 concentrations suggested that ventilation was not sufficient in the mosque during the prayers. The results showed that better ventilation, a preventive cleaning strategy, and a more detailed study are needed.},

(2009) showed that in the pre-sunrise hours, with stable, nocturnal meteorological conditions, the vehicle-related pollution from a freeway in southern California extended more than 2 km downwind. This was in striking contrast to earlier studies in the U.S. and Australia showing that during the daytime pollutant concentrations extended no more than ∼300 m downwind of major roadways. The present study was designed to explore the variability of the large downwind pollutant impact zone observed by Hu et al. (2009) in the pre-sunrise hours on a wider geographic scale. An instrumented mobile platform was employed to measure vehicle-related pollutant concentrations on transects running upwind and downwind of four freeways in the coastal, central and eastern areas of the California South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) during the pre-sunrise period (04:30–06:30). Extended freeway plumes were observed for ultrafine particles (UFP), nitric oxide and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) at all four sites during stable pre-sunrise periods. Plume lengths were measured to be ∼2 km or more with a dilution rate coefficient about a factor of ten lower than commonly observed for daytime. An average of 39 and 19% (±8–9%) of freeway plume peak concentrations of UFP remained 500 and 1500 m downwind, respectively, from the freeways for the four transects studied here. Because a large fraction of UFP and other vehicle related pollutants typically penetrate into indoor environments, and nocturnal surface inversions are widespread across the globe, our findings have significant implications for more extensive human exposures to vehicle-related pollutants than previously indicated based on daytime measurements of roadway plumes.},

The Pb concentrations (annual average: 0.306 μg m−3, range: below detection limit to 2.631 μg m−3) have declined after the phasing out of leaded gasoline, but the concentrations were still higher than those reported in many other cities. Seasonal variations of Pb were significant, with high concentrations in winter, presumably due to the burning of coal, and low concentrations in summer, due to a deep mixed layer and scavenging of aerosols by precipitation. Correlation analyses and enrichment factor calculations both indicated that anthropogenic sources had a large influence on atmospheric Pb. The lead isotope ratios were low in winter (the average 207Pb/206Pb ratio was 0.843 ± 0.032; 208Pb/206Pb was 1.908 ± 0.058) and high in summer (207Pb/206Pb was 0.860 ± 0.032; 208Pb/206Pb was 2.039 ± 0.057), suggesting that coal combustion was the major Pb source in winter and vehicular emission was the major Pb source in summer. Positive Matrix Factorization receptor model indicated that there were five major sources for Pb in PM2.5. Coal combustion was the major contributor, accounting for 39.0% PM2.5 mass, followed by vehicular emissions (30.4%). Other contributors included 17.8% from industrial emissions, 11.6% from biomass burning, and 1.2% from fugitive dust.},

The average PM2.5 concentration (41.9 ± 9.0 μg m−3) exceeded the annual level set by the United States' National Ambient Air Quality Standards (15 μg m−3). The major fraction of PM2.5 consisted of ionic species (accounting for 38.9 ± 8.8%), such as NO3−, SO42−, and NH4+, as well as organic carbon (OC) (accounting for 18.9 ± 5.1%). We also analyzed the seasonal variation in PM2.5 and secondary aerosols such as NO3− and SO42− in PM2.5. While SO42− concentrations were higher in spring and summer, the concentration of PM2.5 and NO3− were the highest in winter. SO42− concentrations were higher during the spring and summer, but PM2.5 and NO3− were highest during the winter. As an important aerosol indicator, water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) (mean 4.7 ± 0.8 μg m−3, 58.9 ± 10.7% of total OC) showed a strong relationship with NO3−, SO42−, and SOC (R2 = 0.56, 0.67, and 0.65, respectively), which was indicative of favorable conditions for SOC formation during the sampling period. Among the individual organic aerosols measured, n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids, levoglucosan, and phthalates were major components, whereas PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), oxy-PAHs, hopanes, and cholestanes were minor components. The concentration of organic compounds during smoggy periods was higher than during non-event periods. The n-alkane and n-alkanoic acid species during the smoggy periods were 10–14 times higher than during the normal period. Using principal component analysis coupled with multiple linear regression analysis, we identified the primary sources of PM2.5 to be motor vehicle/sea salt, secondary organic aerosols, combustion, biogenic/meat cooking, and soil sources.},

   abstract = {Particle number concentration (PNC) and transition metal content are implicated in the health effects of airborne particulate matter (PM) but they are difficult to measure so consequently their temporal and spatial variations are not well characterized. Daily concentrations of PNC and particle-bound water-soluble metals (V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, As, Cd and Pb) were measured at background and kerbside sites in Glasgow and London to examine if other metrics of air pollution such as optical darkness (absorbance) of collected filter samples of PM, gravimetric PM, and NO, NO2 and CO gas concentrations, can be used as surrogates for the temporal and spatial variations of the former. NO2 and NOx exhibited a high degree of within-site correlation and with PNC and water-soluble metals (Fe, Cu, As, Cd, Pb) at background sites in both cities. There is therefore potential to use NO2 and NOx as surrogates for PNC and water-soluble metal at background sites. However, correlation was weaker in complex street canyon environments where pollutant concentrations are strongly affected by local sources and the small-scale variations in pollutant dispersion induced by the wind regimes within street canyons. The corollary of the high correlation between NO2 and PNC and water-soluble metals at the background sites is that the latter pollutants may act as confounders for health effects attributed to NO2 from such sites. Concentrations of CO cannot be used as a surrogate for PNC. Increments in daily NOx and NO2 concentrations between trafficked and background sites were shown to be a simple and novel surrogate for daily spatial variation of PNC; for example, increments in NOx explained 78–79% of the variance in PNC at the paired sites in both Glasgow and London, but relationships were city specific. The increments in NOx also explained 70% of the spatial variation in Cu and Ni in Glasgow but not in London. Weekly NO2 measurements derived from passive diffusion tubes were also shown to correlate well with increments in PNC. A high temporal correlation between PNC and 1,3-butadiene and benzene (which can also be measured by passive sampler) implies that passive sampler measurements may be a straightforward tool for deriving long-term spatial patterns in PNC.},

However, the physicochemical state of individual anthropogenic particulates in ADS including the average grain-size and volume concentrations, grain morphology, and the mixing states with natural minerals is not fully understood. Here we trace pollution features of ADS including the temporal atmospheric loadings of particulates carried by ADS using rock magnetic methods and intensive microscopic analyses. Magnetic concentration has coupled with the total suspended particulates in ADS and has increased ∼9% for the past four years (2004–2007), resulting mainly from the increasing fossil-fuel combustion in East Asia. Notably, most of the observed particles in ADS contain carbon as a major element and some also contain sulfur. In addition, other anthropogenic elemental signatures encompass iron-oxides of combustion origin and heavy metals (Cr, Pb and Zn). Based on the predominance of carbon contents, increasing the atmospheric temperature in East Asia by ADS loadings can be expected by absorbing solar radiation effectively.},

The non-refractory submicron aerosol (NR-PM1) species, i.e., organics, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and chloride were measured in situ at a time resolution of ∼15 min from 26 June to 28 August, 2011. The total NR-PM1 measured by the ACSM agrees well with the PM2.5 measured by a Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM). The average total NR-PM1 mass for the entire study is 50 ± 30 μg m−3 with the organics being the major fraction, accounting for 40% on average. High concentration and mass fraction of nitrate were frequently observed in summer in Beijing, likely due to the high humidity and excess gaseous ammonia that facilitate the transformation of HNO3 to ammonium nitrate particles. Nitrate appears to play an important role in leading to the high particulate matter (PM) pollution since its contribution increases significantly as a function of aerosol mass loadings. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) of ACSM organic aerosol (OA) shows that the oxygenated OA (OOA) – a surrogate of secondary OA dominates OA composition throughout the day, on average accounting for 64%, while the hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) shows a large increase at meal times due to the local cooking emissions. Our results suggest that high PM pollution in Beijing associated with stagnant conditions and southern air masses is characterized by the high contribution of secondary inorganic species and OOA from regional scale, whereas the aerosol particles during the clean events are mainly contributed by the local emissions with organics and HOA being the dominant contribution.},

Asian dust includes soil-derived metals, anthropogenic metals, and many other air pollutants at various concentrations, depending on the atmospheric transport route. Here, we investigated the possible causes for the diversity in symptoms produced by Asian dust events, as reported in a questionnaire survey, on the basis of the dust components and estimated trajectories. Nine dust events were recorded and classified into three types on the basis of light detection and ranging (lidar) data: Type 1 events with high counts of non-mineral dust (spherical) particles, Type 2 events with high counts of mineral dust particles in comparison to non-mineral dust particles, and Type 3 events with very low counts of non-mineral dust particles as compared with other Asian dust events during the surveillance period. Ensemble backward trajectory analysis showed that the atmospheric transport route indeed accounted for the differences. Subjective symptom scores showed the greatest increase after exposure to Type 1 events and a decrease after exposure to Type 3 events. A variety of aerosols were detected concurrent with Asian dust events, and the link between health effects in humans and changes in pollutant levels was explored. The results suggest that the components of Asian dust should be considered when investigating related health effects.},

Results, interpreted on the basis of seasonal variations and atmospheric conditions, have shown that even though domestic heating is the main source of total PAHs in winter, a background pollution including traffic mainly accounts for the carcinogenic and mutagenic risk during the whole year.

   abstract = {Background
Several epidemiological studies have observed significant short-term associations between ozone and daily mortality. In a context of climate change, it is important to understand how this association is influenced by the meteorological conditions.
Objectives
We investigated how season and temperature modified the short-term effect of ozone on mortality by cause in nine French urban areas during the 1998–2006 period.
Methods
The relationship between daily max-8 h ozone and daily mortality was analysed in each city using a time-stratified case-crossover model for the whole year, by season, and by temperature strata. Sensitivity of the results to the statistical modelling strategy, to the choice of the temperature terms, and to the introduction of PM2.5 was examined.
Results
A 10 μg m−3 increase in daily ozone level was significantly associated with an increase in non-accidental (+0.3% [95% CI 0.1; 0.5]), cardiac (+0.7% [0.2; 1.1]) and cardiovascular mortality (+0.4% [0.0; 0.7]). The estimates were larger during summer (+0.8% [0.5; 1.2], +1.3% [0.6; 1.9] and +1.1% [0.3; 1.9] respectively) and for the warmest temperature strata (+0.9% [0.4; 1.3], +1.3% [0.6; 2.1] and +1.2% [0.3; 2.1] respectively). A significant interaction was found between ozone and warm days for non-accidental mortality. Results were robust to the sensitivity analyses.
Conclusions
This study provides evidences of a larger impact of ozone when the temperatures are warmer for non-accidental mortality and cardiovascular mortality.},

   abstract = {Accurate quantification of exposures to traffic-related air pollution in near-highway neighborhoods is challenging due to the high degree of spatial and temporal variation of pollutant levels. The objective of this study was to measure air pollutant levels in a near-highway urban area over a wide range of traffic and meteorological conditions using a mobile monitoring platform. The study was performed in a 2.3-km2 area in Somerville, Massachusetts (USA), near Interstate 93 (I-93), a highway that carries 150,000 vehicles per day. The mobile platform was equipped with rapid-response instruments and was driven repeatedly along a 15.4-km route on 55 days between September 2009 and August 2010. Monitoring was performed in 4–6-h shifts in the morning, afternoon, and evening on both weekdays and weekends in winter, spring, summer, and fall. Measurements were made of particle number concentration (PNC; 4–3000 nm), particle size distribution, fine particle mass (PM2.5), particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pPAH), black carbon (BC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NO and NOx). The highest pollutant concentrations were measured within 0–50 m of I-93 with distance-decay gradients varying depending on traffic and meteorology. The most pronounced variations were observed for PNC. Annual median PNC 0–50 m from I-93 was two-fold higher compared to the background area (>1 km from I-93). In general, PNC levels were highest in winter and lowest in summer and fall, higher on weekdays and Saturdays compared to Sundays, and higher during morning rush hour compared to later in the day. Similar spatial and temporal trends were observed for NO, CO and BC, but not for PM2.5. Spatial variations in PNC distance-decay gradients were non-uniform largely due to contributions from local street traffic. Hour-to-hour, day-to-day and season-to-season variations in PNC were of the same magnitude as spatial variations. Datasets containing fine-scale temporal and spatial variation of air pollution levels near highways may help to inform exposure assessment efforts.},

The monitoring data suggest, inter alia, that there is a change in the behaviour of the suburban-background station of Liossia at about year 2000, indicating that the exact location of this station may need to be reconsidered. Comparison of NOx concentrations in Athens with concentrations in urban areas of other countries reveal that the Patission urban-traffic station records very high NOx concentrations, while remarkably high is the ratio of NO2 concentrations recorded at the urban-traffic vs. the urban-background station in Athens, indicating the overarching role of vehicles and traffic congestion on NO2 formation. The NO2/NOx ratio in the urban-traffic station appears to be almost constant with time, while it has been increasing in other urban areas, such as London and Seoul, suggesting an increased effect of primary NO2 in these areas. Diesel passenger cars were only recently allowed in Athens and, therefore, NO2 trends should be carefully monitored since a possible increase in primary NO2 may affect compliance with NO2 air quality standards.},

   abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated that elevated concentrations of suspended atmospheric particulate matter (PM) are associated with adverse health effects. In order to minimize the adverse public health effects of atmospheric PM by exposure management, there is a need for a greater understanding of the toxic mechanisms and the components that are responsible for the toxic effects. The aim of this study was to utilize bioassay techniques to investigate these aspects. For this purpose a reporter panel of 9 genetically engineered bacterial (Escherichia coli) strains was composed. Each panel member was designed to report on a different stress condition with a measurable light signal produced by the luciferase enzyme. Toxic mechanisms and components were studied using six anthropogenic PM source samples, including two vehicle combustion particles, three coal fly ash (CFA) samples and an urban dust sample. The most prominent outcome of the panel exposure results were broad panel responses observed for two of the CFA samples, indicating oxidative stress, respiration inhibition and iron deficiency. These responses were relieved when the samples were treated with EDTA, a non-specific metal chelator, suggesting the involvement of metals in the observed effects. Bioavailability analysis of the samples suggests that chromium was related to the toxic responses induced by two of the CFA samples. Oxidative stress was also observed in several samples of ambient atmospheric aerosols and excess metal toxicity in an urban dust sample collected in a parking lot. The reporter panel approach, as demonstrated in this study, has the potential of providing novel insights as to the mechanisms of atmospheric PM toxicity. Furthermore, combining the panel's results with bioavailability data can enlighten about the role of different PM components in the observed toxicity.},

   abstract = {A common problem in epidemiological studies on air pollution is exposure misclassification, because investigators often assume exposure is equivalent to outdoor concentrations at participants’ homes or at the nearest urban monitor. The aims of this study were: (1) to develop a new microenvironmental exposure model (MEEM), combining time-activity data with modelled outdoor and indoor NO2 concentrations; (2) to evaluate MEEM against data collected with Ogawa™ personal samplers (OPS); (3) to compare its performance against datasets typically used in epidemiological studies. Schoolchildren wore a personal NO2 sampler, kept a time-activity diary and completed a questionnaire. This information was used by MEEM to estimate individuals’ exposures. These were then compared against concentrations measured by OPS, modelled outdoor concentrations at the children’s home (HOME) and concentrations measured at the nearest urban monitoring station (NUM). The mean exposure predicted by MEEM (mean = 19.6 μg m−³) was slightly lower than the mean exposure measured by OPS (mean = 20.4 μg m−³). The normalised mean bias factor (0.01) and normalised mean absolute error factor (0.25) suggested good agreement. In contrast, the HOME (mean = 31.2 μg m−³) and NUM (mean = 28.6 μg m−³) methods overpredicted exposure and showed systematic errors. The results indicate that personal exposure can be modelled by MEEM with an acceptable level of agreement, while methods such as HOME and NUM show a poorer performance.},

   abstract = {The ESCAPE study (European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects) investigates long-term effects of exposure to air pollution on human health in Europe. This paper documents the spatial variation of measured NO2 and NOx concentrations between and within 36 ESCAPE study areas across Europe. In all study areas NO2 and NOx were measured using standardized methods between October 2008 and April 2011. On average, 41 sites were selected per study area, including regional and urban background as well as street sites. The measurements were conducted in three different seasons, using Ogawa badges. Average concentrations for each site were calculated after adjustment for temporal variation using data obtained from a routine monitor background site. Substantial spatial variability was found in NO2 and NOx concentrations between and within study areas; 40% of the overall NO2 variance was attributable to the variability between study areas and 60% to variability within study areas. The corresponding values for NOx were 30% and 70%. The within-area spatial variability was mostly determined by differences between street and urban background concentrations. The street/urban background concentration ratio for NO2 varied between 1.09 and 3.16 across areas. The highest median concentrations were observed in Southern Europe, the lowest in Northern Europe. In conclusion, we found significant contrasts in annual average NO2 and NOx concentrations between and especially within 36 study areas across Europe. Epidemiological long-term studies should therefore consider different approaches for better characterization of the intra-urban contrasts, either by increasing of the number of monitors or by modelling.},

Water-soluble ions, EC, OC, and trace elements accounted for 45.0%, 1.6%, 14.7%, and 11.4% of the total particle mass (PM), respectively. Approximately 56%, 56%, 30%, 71% and 55% of the PM, water-soluble ions, trace elements, EC and OC, respectively, were associated with particles smaller than 2.1 μm. Sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium were the dominant ions, which together accounted for approximately 77% of total water-soluble ions. The crustal elements accounted for the majority of the trace elements present. Different sources showed different mass size distributions. Anthropogenic source compounds, such as sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, OC, EC, and toxic elements, were mainly present in fine mode aerosols, whereas crustal elements, such as Al, Fe, Ca, Mg and Ba, primarily occurred in the coarse mode. SO42− and NH4+ concentrations were strongly correlated (r2 = 0.90, slope = 1.63) in the fine mode, thereby indicating that SO42− was mainly present as (NH4)2SO4; in contrast, a weak correlation between SO42− and NH4+ (r2 = 0.18, slope = 0.54) was observed in the coarse mode, indicating that SO42− was associated with other ions. Similarly, SO42− and NO3− exhibited a stronger correlation in the fine mode than in the coarse mode, indicating that SO42− and NO3− were formed via the same in-cloud processes in fine particles. The OC/EC ratio and the correlations between EC and OC concentrations showed that the sources of carbonaceous species were secondary organic carbon from fine particles and the long-range transport of coarse carbonaceous particles from biomass burning. The concentrations of atmospheric pollutants declined during the 2008 Olympic Games, indicating that the pollution control measures were effective in decreasing particulate air pollution in Beijing.},

   abstract = {In recent years, artificial intelligence methods have been used for the treatment of environmental problems. This work, presents two models for assessment and prediction of air quality. First, we develop a new computational model for air quality assessment in order to evaluate toxic compounds that can harm sensitive people in urban areas, affecting their normal activities. In this model we propose to use a Sigma operator to statistically asses air quality parameters using their historical data information and determining their negative impact in air quality based on toxicity limits, frequency average and deviations of toxicological tests. We also introduce a fuzzy inference system to perform parameter classification using a reasoning process and integrating them in an air quality index describing the pollution levels in five stages: excellent, good, regular, bad and danger, respectively. The second model proposed in this work predicts air quality concentrations using an autoregressive model, providing a predicted air quality index based on the fuzzy inference system previously developed. Using data from Mexico City Atmospheric Monitoring System, we perform a comparison among air quality indices developed for environmental agencies and similar models. Our results show that our models are an appropriate tool for assessing site pollution and for providing guidance to improve contingency actions in urban areas.},

   abstract = {Yak dung is the primary source of energy for cooking and heating of nomadic Tibetan herders. Personal PM2.5 and indoor CO concentrations and time-activity patterns were investigated in nomadic tents with open stoves and locally available chimney stoves. Personal PM2.5 monitoring using a light-scattering datalogger was performed with women in five tents with open fires and four with chimney stoves over 3 days. Meanwhile, indoor CO variation was also measured. Results showed that 24 h average concentrations of PM2.5 and CO in the tents with open stoves were 1.42 mg m−3 (n = 5, SD = 3.26) and 6.69 mg m−3 (n = 4; SD = 9.11), respectively, which were significantly higher than the tents with chimney stoves having 0.14 mg m−3 (n = 4; SD = 0.65) and 0.12 mg m−3 (n = 4; SD = 1.01) of PM2.5 and CO, respectively. Although chimney stoves significantly reduced indoor air pollution, the concentration of PM2.5 was still higher than annual WHO Air Quality Guideline (0.035 mg m−3). Diurnal variability of PM2.5 and CO was similar and had multiple peaks. This phenomenon was closely connected with behaviors of the participants within the tents. Average 1-h peak concentrations of PM2.5 and CO exceed 24-h mean values by a factor of 5.0 and 4.3, respectively. Significant correlation between hourly PM2.5 and CO concentrations was revealed. Generally, women and children spent 7 h longer than other family members within the tent each day and were thus exposed to higher levels of pollutants. Secondhand tobacco smoke and burning of yak oil lamps are also present in many households, but are much smaller contributors to the exposures. Therefore, yak dung combustion contributes substantially to the personal exposure of householders in this setting even during the warmest time of year in this setting and that although exposures are greatly reduced with chimney stoves; they are still high by comparison to national standards or WHO guidelines.},

Daily mortality, air pollution, and weather data between 2006 and 2009 were collected. The generalized additive model with poison regression was used to estimate the excessive risks (ERs) of air pollutants (PM10, SO2, and NO2) on total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. The effects of lag0–1 were the greatest for total non-accidental and cardiovascular deaths. The increments of 10μgm−3 in SO2, NO2, and PM10 were associated with ERs of 1.54% (95%CI: 1.03–2.06%), 1.42% (95%CI: 1.06–1.78%), and 1.26% (95%CI: 0.86–1.66%) respectively for total non-accidental deaths, and 2.28% (95%CI: 1.40–3.16%), 1.81% (95%CI: 1.20–2.41%), and 1.79% (95%CI: 1.11–2.47%) respectively for cardiovascular deaths. For persons who died from respiratory disease, however, the maximum effects occurred at lag0. The ERs for SO2, NO2, and PM10 were 1.36% (95%CI: 0.23–2.50%), 1.47% (95%CI: 0.66–2.29%) and 0.93% (95%CI: 0.03–1.83%), respectively. The effects of the three air pollutants on mortality were stronger in elderly and in women. The ERs in the present study were higher than those reported in Europe, the U.S., and most other Asian cities. Our findings show relatively higher ERs of daily mortality by ambient air pollutants in the center of Guangzhou, China, compared with estimates in other cities. Further studies with accurate exposure measurement among homogeneous population are needed to evaluate the precise magnitudes of the effects of the air pollutants.},

   abstract = {Using the data on all live births (∼400,000) and criteria pollutants from the Chicago Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) between 2000 and 2004, this paper empirically demonstrates how mismatches in the spatiotemporal scales of health and air pollution data can result in inconsistency and uncertainty in the linkages between air pollution and birth outcomes. This paper suggests that the risks of low birth weight associated with air pollution exposure changes significantly as the distance interval (around the monitoring stations) used for exposure estimation changes. For example, when the analysis was restricted within 3 miles distance of the monitoring stations the odds of LBW (births <2500 g) increased by a factor of 1.045 (±0.0285 95% CI) with a unit increase in the average daily exposure to PM10 (in μg m−3) during the gestation period; the value dropped to 1.028 when the analysis was restricted within 6 miles distance of air pollution monitoring stations. The effect of PM10 exposure on LBW became null when controlled for confounders. But PM2.5 exposure showed a significant association with low birth weight when controlled for confounders. These results must be interpreted with caution, because the distance to monitoring station does not influence the risks of adverse birth outcomes, but uncertainty in exposure increases with the increase in distance from the monitoring stations, especially for coarse particles such as PM10 that settle with gravity within short distance and time interval. The results of this paper have important implications for the research design of environmental epidemiological studies, and the way air pollution (and potentially other environmental) and health data are collocated to compute exposure. While this paper challenges the findings of pervious epidemiological studies that have relied on coarse resolution air pollution data (such as county level aggregated data), the paper also calls for time-space resolved estimate of air pollution to minimize uncertainty in exposure estimation.},

The values of concentration diagnostic ratios indicated a mixture of vehicular emissions, fuel evaporation, oil residues and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in outdoor and indoor samples. Particulate iso/anteiso-alkanes, specific tracers of ETS, were detected in both non-smoking and smoking households. The indoor-to-outdoor ratios of particulate iso/anteiso-alkanes and unresolved complex mixture (a tracer of outdoor air pollution) in non-smoking households were comparable to the measured air exchange rate. This suggested that penetration of outdoor air was solely responsible for the detection of tobacco smoke particulate tracers in indoor non-smoking environments. Overall, residential outdoor concentrations accounted for a large fraction (from 25 up to 79%) of indoor aliphatic and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Open windows/doors and the operation of an air condition unit yielded also in higher indoor concentrations than those measured outdoors.},

The protein concentration in PM10 ranged from 2.08 to 36.71 μg m−3 with an average of 11.42 μg m−3. This was the highest value reported so far in the literature. The total protein was found to have a significant correlation with the air pollution index (API) and mean visibility (VV), indicating the potential influence of anthropogenic sources and/or crustal sources. The protein content displayed an obvious seasonal variation with respect to weather conditions. In the rainy season the level of protein was low, while in the dry season and foggy weather the level of protein was relatively high. A correlation analysis revealed that the relationship between total protein concentration and water-soluble ions K+ and NO3− in PM10 during the dry season is 0.92 and 0.66 (P < 0.05), respectively, suggesting that anthropogenic pollution and biomass burning are main contributors during this period.},

Toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (TEX) presented higher (p < 0.05) ambient levels in WFS than in CDS, particularly during weekdays. A stronger association between personal and ambient concentrations of MTBE and TEX was found in WFS than in CDS. Fourteen to forty-two percent of the variation in personal MTBE, hexane, benzene, and TEX was explained by local outdoor air pollution. These observations indicated that local sources impacted the community air pollution and personal exposure in WFS. The estimated cancer risks resulting from two locally emitted VOCs, benzene and ethylbenzene, and non-cancer neurological and respiratory effects resulting from hexane, benzene, toluene, and xylenes exceeded the US EPA risk benchmarks in both communities. These findings emphasized the need to address disparity in health risks associated with ambient air pollution for the socio-economically disadvantaged groups. This study also demonstrated that air pollution hot spots similar to WFS can provide robust setting to investigate health effects of ambient air pollution.},

We estimate the impact of these restrictions on the city's air quality using data collected by a network of monitoring stations. The estimates show that the restrictions do reduce the average concentrations of coarse and fine particulate matter, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide (both gases are emitted mainly by vehicles). However, no significant changes were found in the sulfur dioxide concentrations, which are primarily the result of industrial processes.},

The mean concentrations of trace metals were found in the order of Fe>Cu>Zn>Mn>Cr>Cd>Pb>Ni. Mean Pb concentrations were found to be ranging from 0.024μg/m3 to 0.32μg/m3, Ni 0.002μg/m3 to 0.02μg/m3, Cu 0.06μg/m3 to 6.32μg/m3 while Mn varied from 0.14μg/m3 to 1.9μg/m3. Fe, Zn, Cd and Cr varied from 1.43μg/m3 to 28.48μg/m3, 0.16μg/m3 to 2.55μg/m3, 0.03μg/m3 to 0.07μg/m3 and 0.11μg/m3 to 0.42μg/m3 respectively. Univariate (correlation study) and Multivariate statistical analysis were adopted including; factor analysis and enrichment factor analysis to identify the sources and their contributions to particulate matter. The major sources of airborne trace metals identified were mainly coal mining and associated activities, emissions from automobile exhaust and industries, resuspended soil dust and earth crust, biomass burning, oil combustion, and fugitive emissions.},

O3 and NOx were inversely related; the highest average NOx concentration (29ppb) occurred in winter while average O3 concentrations peaked in summer up to 36.2ppb. The seasonal variations of O3 were more distinct than NOx. In multiple linear and principal component regression analysis, ambient levels of NO2 and O3 were influenced primarily by wind speed. In time series and regression analysis, NO2 and O3 displayed an inverse relationship with wind speed but O3 paradoxically increased with wind speed downwind. The seasonality of O3 was amplified mainly by wind speed and temperature, while NOx displayed stronger dependence on diurnal source emissions. Concentrations of NOx and O3 were also influenced by differences in chemical processing through their complex emission–production and consumption mechanisms, making them interdependent. In intense solar radiation, O3 was NOx–dependent but as O3 levels were inhibited by lower temperatures, NOx concentrations increased. Higher O3 on weekends indicated an apparent sensitivity to VOC precursors. This study provides a basis for improved air quality standards primarily in summer and during daily O3 peaks. Additionally, plans for protection against health problems caused by O3 and NOX are feasible in this region.},

The overall mean mass concentration was 28.4±25.4μg m−3 for PM2.5 and 87.3±47.3μg m−3 for PM10, with significant temporal and spatial variability. The average ratio of PM2.5/PM10 was 0.33. Chemical composition data were modeled using factor analysis with Varimax orthogonal rotation to determine five and four particle source categories contributing significant amount of for PM2.5 and PM10 mass, respectively. In both PM2.5 and PM10 sources were (1) heavy oil combustion characterized by high Ni and V; (2) re-suspended soil characterized by high concentrations of Ca, Fe, Al, and Si; and (3) a mixed industrial source. The two other sources in PM2.5 were (4) traffic source identified by presence of Pb, Br, and Se; (5) other industrial source mixture; while in PM10 it was marine aerosol. To estimate the mass contributions of each individual source category, the PM mass concentration was regressed against the factor scores. Cumulatively, re-suspended soil and oil combustion contributed 77 and 82% mass of PM2.5 and PM10, respectively.},

   abstract = {Coal dust is a major pollutant in the ambient air of coal mining areas. The pollution due to open cast mining is more severe than pollution due to underground mining. Prediction of ambient concentration of pollutants should be known to implement any control techniques to reduce their concentrations. In this paper, three models were developed to predict the concentration of dust particles at various locations away from the source of pollution. These models are developed using Multilayer Perception Network and learning is done by back–propagation algorithm. The data for training and testing the network is collected from the field work done in North Karanpura Coal Mine in Jharkhand, India, which is an open cast mine. The meteorological data (wind velocity, dispersion coefficients, rain fall, cloud cover and temperature), geographical data (distance of the receptor point from the source in the direction of wind and distance of the receptor from source in the direction perpendicular to wind direction) and emission rate are used as inputs in the formation of models. The number of inputs for Model 1, Model 2, and Model 3 are six, seven, and nine, respectively. The output (dust concentration) is same for all the three models. The performance of the developed models was evaluated on the basis index of agreement and other statistical parameters i.e., the mean and the deviations of the observed and predicted concentrations, root mean square error, maximum deviation and minimum deviation, normalized mean square error, model bias and fractional bias. It was seen that the overall performance of Model 3 was better than Models 1 and 2. Artificial neural network (ANN) based dust concentration prediction model yielded a better performance than the Gaussian–Plume model.},

The purpose was to understand the pollution trends associated with the high density road traffic intersections considering the levels of particulate matter concentrations (PM10), representing the occupational and ambient air quality of the traffic police personnel of the Kathmandu valley, Nepal. The study indicates that the occupational PM10 play a significant dominant role in controlling ambient PM10 loads at the high density road traffic intersections. The occupational and ambient PM10 concentrations in high density traffic area and road intersection of Kathmandu Valley showed a marked monthly and seasonal variation. High density traffic areas and road intersection of the Kathmandu valley were seriously polluted by PM10. Monthly and yearly average occupational and ambient PM10 concentration at the high density traffic areas and road intersection greatly exceeded the 24–h average limit value (120μg m−3) in Nepal.},

An analysis reveals that the average concentrations of arsenic species in TSPs and dry deposits were highest at the Quan-xing sampling site, located in a severely polluted area where numerous industrial factories are located. The average seasonal concentrations of arsenic species in TSPs were highest in winter and fall in all instances. Analytical results reveal that low-wind conditions increased the concentrations of arsenic species in fall and winter at the five study sampling sites. Finally, Noll and Fang's model yielded the best predictions of the dry-deposited ambient air arsenic species (As, As(III), and As(V)) dry deposition for when the particles were larger than 5.6μm, while Baklanov and Sorensen's model yielded the most accurate results when the particles were smaller than 5.6μm.},

The mass concentrations of PM2.5 ranged from 18.45 to 78.89μg/m3, with the average value of 44.33±16.30μg/m3. The elemental compositions were dominated by Si, Ca, Fe, K, and Al. SO42−, NO3−, and NH4+ were the major ions, contributing 24.3%, 9.9%, and 8.8% to the total PM2.5 mass. The concentrations of above ions showed distinct seasonality of 2.2, 8.0, and 5.9 times higher in winter than those in summer, respectively. (NH4)2SO4 and NH4NO3 were the main forms in summer and winter and NH4NO3 mainly existed in autumn, while (NH4)2SO4, NH4HSO4 and NH4NO3 existed in spring. The high NO3−/SO42− ratio suggested that vehicular exhaust made an important contribution to atmospheric pollution. TC occupied 24.1% of PM2.5 mass, with a distribution of 19.2% OC and 4.9% EC. OC and EC had the common dominant sources in spring due to their strong correlation. The OC/EC ratio showed obviously seasonal distribution of 5.0 in spring, 2.7 in summer, 3.6 in autumn, and 4.2 in winter.

These effects were stronger in fall, winter and spring for upper respiratory infections while for lower respiratory infections the association was significant only during spring. Low socio-economic conditions and low education levels increased the risk of respiratory infections.

   abstract = {The aim of this novel research was to determine the toxic burden of increased elements in water resources on the inhabitant wild animals (squirrels, turtles, bats), using particle induced x-ray emission (PIXE) and histopathological approaches. PIXE analysis of skin, muscle, lung, liver and kidney revealed significant increase in Al, Cl, Fe, Mg, Mn, Si and V. Moreover, data clearly reflect a significant (P < 0.001) deposition of toxic elements (Al, Cl, Fe and K) in the lung producing interstitial/proliferative pneumonitis, intra-alveolar hemorrhages, and thickening of alveolar capillary walls. The results obtained from the liver samples emphasized that majority of the animals were intoxicated with Cl, Mg, S, Si and V, which have produced profound deterioration and swelling of the hepatocytes. Likewise, histopathology of the kidney sections spotlighted severe nephritis and degenerative changes, which could be associated with the elevated amount of Al, Cl and Mg. This data undoubtedly provide relevant information on the heavy burden of toxic elements and their pathological outcomes in wild animals and highlight their potential risks for human exposure. Thus, the information provided is critical for developing effective strategies in dealing with health hazards associated with elemental exposures.},

   abstract = {Background: The insecticide chlordecone was extensively used in the French West Indies to control banana root borer. Its persistence in soils has led to the widespread pollution of the environment, and human beings are still exposed to this chemical. Chlordecone has been shown to impair neurological and behavioural functions in rodents when exposed gestationally or neonatally. Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of prenatal and postnatal exposure to chlordecone on the cognitive, visual, and motor development of 7-month-old infants from Guadeloupe. Methods: Infants were tested at 7 months (n=153). Visual recognition memory and processing speed were assessed with the Fagan Tests of Infant Intelligence (FTII), visual acuity with the Teller Acuity Card, and fine motor development with the Brunet-Lezine. Samples of cord blood and breast milk at 3 months (n=88) were analyzed for chlordecone concentrations. Postnatal exposure was determined through breast feeding and frequency of contaminated food consumption by the infants. Results: Cord chlordecone concentrations in tertiles were associated with reduced novelty preference on the FTII in the highly exposed group (β=−0.19, p=0.02). Postnatal exposure through contaminated food consumption was marginally related to reduced novelty preference (β=−0.14, p=0.07), and longer processing speed (β=0.16, p=0.07). Detectable levels of chlordecone in cord blood were associated with higher risk of obtaining low scores on the fine motor development scale (OR=1.25, p<0.01). Conclusion: These results suggest that pre- and postnatal low chronic exposure to chlordecone is associated with negative effects on cognitive and motor development during infancy.},

   abstract = {Background
Cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles improve the burning efficiency of fuel, however, little is known about health impacts of altered emissions from the vehicles.
Methods
Atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE−/−) mice were exposed by inhalation to diluted exhaust (1.7mg/m3, 20, 60 or 180min, 5 day/week, for 4 weeks), from an engine using standard diesel fuel (DE) or the same diesel fuel containing 9ppm cerium oxide nanoparticles (DCeE). Changes in hematological indices, clinical chemistry, atherosclerotic burden, tissue levels of inflammatory cytokines and pathology of the major organs were assessed.
Results
Addition of CeO2 to fuel resulted in a reduction of the number (30%) and surface area (10%) of the particles in the exhaust, whereas the gaseous co-pollutants were increased (6–8%). There was, however, a trend towards an increased size and complexity of the atherosclerotic plaques following DE exposure, which was not evident in the DCeE group. There were no clear signs of altered hematological or pathological changes induced by either treatment. However, levels of proinflammatory cytokines were modulated in a brain region and liver following DCeE exposure.
Conclusions
These results imply that addition of CeO2 nanoparticles to fuel decreases the number of particles in exhaust and may reduce atherosclerotic burden associated with exposure to standard diesel fuel. From the extensive assessment of biological parameters performed, the only concerning effect of cerium addition was a slightly raised level of cytokines in a region of the central nervous system. Overall, the use of cerium as a fuel additive may be a potentially useful way to limit the health effects of vehicle exhaust. However, further testing is required to ensure that such an approach is not associated with a chronic inflammatory response which may eventually cause long-term health effects.},

   abstract = {The massive increase in emissions of air pollutants due to economic and industrial growth in developing countries has made air quality a crucial health problem in this continent. Hence, it is somewhat critical to have a better knowledge on the air pollution in Sub-Saharan Africa countries. Three air pollution PM2.5 samples were also collected in two urban sites (i.e. Fann and Faidherbe) in Dakar (Senegal) and in a rural site near Dakar (i.e. Ngaparu). The two urban sites mainly differ in the type of used vehicles: in Fann, most of the traffic is made of buses, which are absent, in Faidherbe. The physicochemical characteristics of the three PM2.5 samples revealed their high heterogeneities and complexities, related to the multiple natural and anthropogenic emission sources. Results from 5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation into DNA, mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, and extracellular lactate dehydrogenase activity in PM2.5-exposed BEAS-2B cells suggested the exposure conditions (i.e. 3 and 12μg PM/cm² during 24, 48, and 72h) to further consider. The organic fractions (i.e. mainly PAHs) of the PM2.5 samples were able to induce a time and/or concentration-dependent gene expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, and, to a lesser extent, NQO1. There was a time and/or dose-dependent increase of both the gene expression and/or protein secretion of inflammatory mediators (i.e. TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and/or IL-8) in PM2.5-exposed BEAS-2B cells. In agreement with the physicochemical characterization, urban PM2.5 samples caused greater biological responses in BEAS-2B cells than the rural one. Variable concentrations of transition metals (i.e. Fe, Al, Pb, Mn, Zn) and organic compounds (i.e. PAHs) founded in the three PM2.5 samples might be firmly involved in a time- and/or dose-dependent toxicity, relying on inflammatory processes.},

   abstract = {Extreme cold and heat waves, characterized by a number of cold or hot days in succession, place a strain on people's cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The increase in deaths due to these waves may be greater than that predicted by extreme temperatures alone. We examined cold and heat waves in 99 US cities for 14 years (1987–2000) and investigated how the risk of death depended on the temperature threshold used to define a wave, and a wave's timing, duration and intensity. We defined cold and heat waves using temperatures above and below cold and heat thresholds for two or more days. We tried five cold thresholds using the first to fifth percentiles of temperature, and five heat thresholds using the 95–99 percentiles. The extra wave effects were estimated using a two-stage model to ensure that their effects were estimated after removing the general effects of temperature. The increases in deaths associated with cold waves were generally small and not statistically significant, and there was even evidence of a decreased risk during the coldest waves. Heat waves generally increased the risk of death, particularly for the hottest heat threshold. Cold waves of a colder intensity or longer duration were not more dangerous. Cold waves earlier in the cool season were more dangerous, as were heat waves earlier in the warm season. In general there was no increased risk of death during cold waves above the known increased risk associated with cold temperatures. Cold or heat waves earlier in the cool or warm season may be more dangerous because of a build up in the susceptible pool or a lack of preparedness for extreme temperatures.},

   abstract = {Indoor air quality (IAQ) has been understudied in day-care centres (DCCs), even though it can affect the respiratory health of children. This study was undertaken to assess IAQ in a randomly selected sample of 21 DCCs having space for at least 40 children in Montréal, Canada, and to determine associations between building characteristics and IAQ. Questionnaires on building characteristics and operation of the DCC were administered to managers. Temperature, relative humidity, and concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds were measured in January and February 2008 in rooms attended by children aged between 18 and 60 months. Most DCCs (81%) had a mechanical ventilation system. Over 85% of the DCCs had a mean CO2 concentration higher than 1000ppm, the value generally targeted for comfort in buildings. Mean CO2 concentrations were significantly lower in DCCs having a floor space meeting the provincial standards. The mean (standard deviation–SD) formaldehyde concentration was 22.9 (8.2)μg/m3, with all participating DCCs being within Health Canada's Residential IAQ Guideline of 50μg/m3. The presence of a mechanical ventilation system and a large surface of play area per child were significantly associated with lower CO2 levels, explaining 44% of the variance in indoor CO2 concentrations. The presence of a mechanical ventilation system was also associated with significantly lower formaldehyde and acetaldehyde levels. Moreover, 68% of the variance in indoor acetaldehyde concentrations was explained by CO2 levels, indicating that CO2 was a better proxy of ventilation than the presence of a ventilation system, as this latter variable did not imply that the ventilation system was running or functioning adequately. These results demonstrate the need for on-going efforts to ensure sufficient floor space and adequate ventilation in DCCs to maintain good IAQ.},

Most studies of particles examined total mass, although the chemical structure of particles varies widely. We investigated whether mother's exposure to potassium (K) and titanium (Ti) components of airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during pregnancy was associated with birth weight or risk of low birth weight (<2500g) for term infants. The study population was 76,788 infants born in four counties in Connecticut and Massachusetts, US, for August 2000–February 2004. Both K and Ti were associated with birth weight. An interquartile range (IQR) increase K was associated with an 8.75% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.24–16.8%) increase in risk of low birth weight. An IQR increase in Ti was associated with a 12.1% (95% CI: 3.55–21.4%) increase in risk of low birth weight, with an estimate of 6.41% (95% CI: −5.80–20.2%) for males and 16.4% (95% CI: 5.13–28.9%) for females. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis of first births only, but not adjustment by co-pollutants. Disentangling the effects of various chemical components is challenging because of the covariance among some components due to similar sources. Central effect estimates for infants of African–American mothers were higher than those of white mothers, although the confidence intervals overlapped. Our results indicate that exposure to airborne potassium and titanium during pregnancy is associated with lower birth weight. Associations may relate to chemical components of sources producing K and Ti.},

Few studies have examined the acute cardiorespiratory effects of specific volatile organic compound (VOC) exposures from traffic pollution.
Methods
A cross-over study was conducted among 42 healthy adults during summer 2010 in Ottawa, Canada. Participants cycled for 1-h along high and low-traffic routes and VOC exposures were determined along each route. Lung function, exhaled nitric oxide, and heart rate variability were monitored before cycling and 1–4h after the start of cycling. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to examine the relationship between 26 VOCs and acute changes in clinical outcomes adjusted for potential confounding factors.
Results
Each inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in propane/butane exposure was associated with a 2.0millisecond (ms) (95% CI: 0.65, 3.2) increase in SDNN (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals), a 24ms2 (95% CI: 6.6, 41) increase in HF (high frequency power), and a 65ms2 (95% CI: 11, 118) increase in LF (low frequency power) in the hours following cycling. IQR increases in ethane and isoprene were associated with a 5.8ms (95% CI: −9.8, −1.7): decrease in SDNN and a 24ms2 (95% CI: −44, −7.9) decrease in HF, respectively. IQR increases in benzene exposure were associated with a 1.7ppb (95% CI: 1.1, 2.3) increase in exhaled nitric oxide and each IQR increase in 3-methylhexane exposure was associated with a 102mL (95% CI: −157, −47) decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1-s.
Conclusions
Exposure to traffic-related VOCs may contribute to acute changes in lung function, inflammation, or heart rate variability.},

   abstract = {Most of the studies differentiating the effect of size-classified particulate matter (PM) exposure have been carried out in cities where the average levels of fine particles (PM2.5) were higher than those of coarse particles (PM10–2.5). These studies have suggested that PM2.5 is associated with daily mortality, but there is only limited evidence that PM10–2.5 is independently associated with mortality. The citizens of the Canary Islands are exposed to PM which is highly influenced by mineral dust because of the islands’ proximity to the Western Coast of Morocco. This offers an excellent opportunity to analyze in detail the short-term association between PM size fractions and total, respiratory and heart disease mortality. A time-series study from 2001 to 2004 was carried out. For each PM size fraction and mortality outcome, Generalized Additive Poisson Model was performed controlling for potential confounding. Different lag structures, unconstrained distributed lag models and two-pollutant models were examined. After assessing the linearity in the relationship, a piecewise linear analysis for exploring the existence of different slopes for different ranges of PM was carried out. The 10μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and PM10–2.5 levels was associated with a 7.5% (95% confidence interval=0.4–15.0) and a 7.4 (95% CI=1.5–13.7) increase in heart and respiratory disease mortality, respectively. Spline curves were quite linear over the PM concentrations seen on most days (dominated by combustion sources) in these cities, meanwhile on days with higher particulate levels (natural sources) a risk increase above certain PM levels was found, suggesting a curvilinear association and that, at least in some locations, PM10–2.5 can play an important role in PM-related toxicity. The overall findings suggest that the establishment of new air quality standards for the short-term effect of PM2.5 and PM10–2.5 and further limiting levels of PM10 in European Union is advisable.},

   abstract = {Background
Exposure to high levels of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5μm (PM2.5) resulting from biomass burning is frequent in the subequatorial Amazon region.
Objective
To investigate whether or not current exposure to PM2.5 in the Brazilian Amazon has adverse effects on the daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) of schoolchildren.
Methods
The study design consisted of a panel comprising 309 children aged 6 to 15 years from the same school. PEF was measured daily, except weekends and holidays, from August to December 2006. Each child contributed to the study up to 67 daily measurements. All together there were 19115 PEF measures. Participation rate was 90%. Daily measurements of PM2.5, temperature, and humidity as well as passive smoking, and subject features were regarded in the statistical analysis. Various exposures of PM2.5 were considered throughout the analysis, among them 24-hour, 12-hour, 6-hour, and 5-hour means. To account for subject responses to confounders, mixed effects models were applied. The effects were evaluated considering air pollution levels on the current day or at 1- or 2-day lags and the averages of 0–1-day lags, 1–2-day lags and 0-, 1-, and 2-day lags.
Results
The 24-hour PM2.5 means ranged from 6.39 to 99.91μg/m3. The adjusted models for the entire group of children revealed adverse effects. For instance, for an increase of 10μg/m3 in PM2.5, the reduction in the PEF average varied between 0.26l/min (95% Confidence Interval (CI): −0.49; −0.04) and 0.38l/min (95% CI: −0.71; −0.04). Restricted to the subgroup of non-asthmatic children, classified as such according to the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire, there was a reduction in the PEF ranging from 0.38l/min (95% CI: −0.63; −0.13) to 0.53l/min (95% CI: −0.90; −0.16) for an increase of 10μg/m3 in PM2.5. There was no significant effect in the asthmatic group. When stratified by time of the day children were at school, the concurrent effects of air pollution on PEF were not significant, whereas the 6-hour exposure from 0am to 5:30am was significant for both morning and afternoon groups. Finally, the 24-hour mean lagged effect was only significant for the afternoon group of children. For an increase of 10μg/m3 in PM2.5, there was a reduction in the PEF that ranged from 0.41l/min (95% CI: −0.76; −0.06) to 0.49l/min (95% CI: −0.91; −0.07).
Conclusion
Exposure to current levels of PM2.5 in the Brazilian Amazon was associated with reductions in the lung function of schoolchildren. The adverse effects were more consistent in non-asthmatic children and with respect to the 6-hour mean from 0am to 5.30am.},

   abstract = {Parks and green space areas are important to human health for psychological and physiological reasons. There have been few evaluations of access to green space on mortality. This paper describes a cohort study of approximately 575,000 adults, 35 years of age and older, who resided in 10 urban areas in Ontario, Canada, between 1982 and 1986. Individuals were identified from income tax filings, and vital status was determined up to December 31, 2004 through record linkage to the Canadian Mortality Data Base. Place of residence was defined by postal code data that were extracted from income tax filings. Urban green space was defined by Landsat satellite retrievals with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and this was assigned to individuals' place of residence at inception into the cohort using both a 30m grid cell and a 500m buffer. The proportional hazards model was used to estimate rate ratios (RRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for selected underlying causes of death. The rate ratios were adjusted for income, marital status, ambient air pollution, and contextual neighborhood characteristics. About 187,000 subjects died during follow-up. An increase in the interquartile range of green space, using a 500m buffer, was associated with reduced non-accidental mortality (RR=0.95, 95% CI=0.94–0.96). Reductions in mortality with increased residential green space were observed for each underlying cause of death; the strongest association was found for respiratory disease mortality (RR=0.91, 95% CI=0.89–0.93). Risk estimates were essentially unchanged after adjusting for ambient air pollution. Our study suggests that green space in urban environments was associated with long-term reduction in mortality although this finding should be interpreted cautiously as this association may be influenced by residual confounding of sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Further research is needed to: confirm these findings, better understand the relationships between access to green space and behavioral risk factors for mortality, and identify what green space characteristics may confer the greatest health benefit.},

As part of the China Air Pollution and Health Effects Study (CAPES), this study aimed at investigating the short-term association between SO2 and daily mortality in 17 Chinese cities. We applied two-stage Bayesian hierarchical models to obtain city-specific and national average estimates for SO2. In each city, we used Poisson regression models incorporating natural spline smoothing functions to adjust for long-term and seasonal trend of mortality, as well as other time-varying covariates. We examined the associations by age, gender and education status. As a result, the combined analysis showed that an increase of 10μg/m3 of two-day moving averaged SO2 was associated with 0.75% [95% posterior interval (PI), 0.47 to 1.02], 0.83% (0.95% PI, 0.47 to 1.19) and 1.25% (95% PI, 0.78 to 1.73) increase of total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, respectively. The effects of SO2 appeared more evident among the elderly. These associations were generally independent of particles with aerodynamic diameter <10μm (PM10) but did not persist after adjustment for nitrogen dioxide (NO2). In conclusions, this largest epidemiologic study of air pollution in China to date suggests that short-term exposure to SO2 is associated with increased mortality risk; however, these associations may be attributable to SO2 serving as a surrogate of other substances. Further studies are needed to tackle the independent health effect of SO2.},

   abstract = {Background
Asthma affects more than 17 million people in the United States;1/3 of these are children. Children are particularly vulnerable to airborne pollution because of their narrower airways and because they generally breathe more air per pound of body weight than adults, increasing their exposure to air pollutants. However, the results from previous studies on the association between motor vehicle emissions and the development of childhood wheeze and asthma are conflicting. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify their potential relationship.
Methods
MEDLINE, Highwire, and The Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant studies. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between traffic air pollutants and wheeze or asthma were retrieved from individual studies and pooled to generate summary effect estimates (meta-OR) in STATA 11.1.
Results
Nineteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide (meta-OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00–1.11), nitrous oxide (meta-OR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00–1.04), and carbon monoxide (meta-OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01–1.12) were positively associated with a higher prevalence of childhood asthma. Exposure to sulfur dioxide (meta-OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01–1.07) was positively associated with a higher prevalence of wheeze in children. Exposure to nitrogen dioxide was positively associated with a higher incidence of childhood asthma (meta-OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.06–1.24), and exposures to particulate matter was positively associated with a higher incidence of wheeze in children (meta-OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.04–1.07).
Conclusions
Living or attending schools near high traffic density roads exposes children to higher levels of motor vehicle air pollutants, and increases the incidence and prevalence of childhood asthma and wheeze.},

Our objective was to investigate the correlation between air pollution and acute manifestations of blepharitis. Method: We recorded all cases of changes in the eyelids and ocular surface, and rated clinical findings on a scale from zero (normal) to two (severe alterations). Daily values of carbon monoxide, particulate matter smaller than 10μm in diameter and nitrogen dioxide concentrations and meteorological variables (temperature and relative humidity) in the vicinity of the medical service were obtained. Specific linear regression models for each outcome were constructed including pollutants as independent variables (single pollutant models). Temperature and humidity were included as confounding variables. Results: increases of 28.8μg/m3 in the concentration of particulate matter and 1.1ppm in the concentration of CO were associated with increases in cases of blepharitis on the day of exposure (5 cases, 95% CI: 1–10 and 6 cases, 95% CI: 1–12, respectively). Conclusion: Exposure to usual air pollutants concentrations present in large cities affects, in a consistent manner, the eyes of residents contributing to the increasing incidence of diseases of the eyelid margin.},

The use of biomass for cooking and heating is considered an important factor associated with respiratory diseases. However, few studies evaluate the amount of particulate matter less than 2.5μm in diameter (PM2.5), symptoms and lung function in the same population.
Objectives
To evaluate the respiratory effects of biomass combustion and compare the results with those of individuals from the same community in Brazil using liquefied petroleum gas (Gas).
Methods
1402 individuals in 260 residences were divided into three groups according to exposure (Gas, Indoor-Biomass, Outside-Biomass). Respiratory symptoms were assessed using questionnaires. Reflectance of paper filters was used to assess particulate matter exposure. In 48 residences the amount of PM2.5 was also quantified. Pulmonary function tests were performed in 120 individuals.
Results
Reflectance index correlated directly with PM2.5 (r=0.92) and was used to estimate exposure (ePM2.5). There was a significant increase in ePM2.5 in Indoor-Biomass and Outside-Biomass, compared to Gas. There was a significantly increased odds ratio (OR) for cough, wheezing and dyspnea in adults exposed to Indoor-Biomass (OR=2.93, 2.33, 2.59, respectively) and Outside-Biomass (OR=1.78, 1.78, 1.80, respectively) compared to Gas. Pulmonary function tests revealed both Non-Smoker-Biomass and Smoker-Gas individuals to have decreased %predicted-forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) as compared to Non-Smoker-Gas . Pulmonary function tests data was inversely correlated with duration and ePM2.5. The prevalence of airway obstruction was 20% in both Non-Smoker-Biomass and Smoker-Gas subjects.
Conclusion
Chronic exposure to biomass combustion is associated with increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms, reduced lung function and development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These effects are associated with the duration and magnitude of exposure and are exacerbated by tobacco smoke.},

   abstract = {Background
Air pollutants in Iceland's capital area include hydrogen sulfide (H2S) emissions from geothermal power plants, particle pollution (PM10) and traffic-related pollutants. Respiratory health effects of exposure to PM and traffic pollutants are well documented, yet this is one of the first studies to investigate short-term health effects of ambient H2S exposure.
Objectives
The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between daily ambient levels of H2S, PM10, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3), and the use of drugs for obstructive pulmonary diseases in adults in Iceland's capital area.
Methods
The study period was 8 March 2006 to 31 December 2009. We used log-linear Poisson generalized additive regression models with cubic splines to estimate relative risks of individually dispensed drugs by air pollution levels. A three-day moving average of the exposure variables gave the best fit to the data. Final models included significant covariates adjusting for climate and influenza epidemics, as well as time-dependent variables.
Results
The three-day moving average of H2S and PM10 levels were positively associated with the number of individuals who were dispensed drugs at lag 3–5, corresponding to a 2.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4, 3.6) and 0.9% (95% CI 0.1, 1.8) per 10μg/m3 pollutant concentration increase, respectively.
Conclusion
Our findings indicated that intermittent increases in levels of particle matter from traffic and natural sources and ambient H2S levels were weakly associated with increased dispensing of drugs for obstructive pulmonary disease in Iceland's capital area. These weak associations could be confounded by unevaluated variables hence further studies are needed.},

Background
Patients who have asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations are at risk for recurrent exacerbation events. Our objectives were to assess whether receiving a controller medication at discharge affects risk of recurrence and whether delaying controller initiation alters this risk.
Methods
Asthma patients with an ED visit or inpatient (IP) stay who received a controller dispensing within 6 months were identified from healthcare claims. Cox proportional hazards of the time to first recurrence of an asthma-related ED or IP visit in the 6-month period following the initial event were constructed, with time following discharge without controller medication as the primary predictor.
Results
A total of 6139 patients met inclusion criteria, 78% with an ED visit and 22% with an IP visit; 15% had a recurrence within 6 months. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) associated with not having controller medication at discharge was 1.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.42–2.25). The controller-by-time interaction was significant (P<0.001), with hazard rising as time-to-controller initiation increased. Delaying initiation by 1 day approximately tripled the risk (HR 2.95; 95%CI 1.48–5.88). Sensitivity analyses, including accounting for controller fills prior to the index event, did not substantially alter these results.
Conclusions
This observational study shows that the risk of a recurrent asthma-related ED visit or IP stay increased as the time to initiate a controller increased. Our findings support the importance of early controller initiation following an asthma-related ED or IP visit in reducing risk of recurrence.},

Particle exposure is known to have negative health effects. In Stockholm the environment in the subway has been reported to have higher particle exposure levels, measured as PM2.5 and PM10, than roads with intense traffic in the inner city area. We have recently shown that healthy volunteers exposed to subway environment had statistically significant increase of fibrinogen and CD4 cells expressing regulatory T-cell marker CD25bright/FOXP3 in blood. The aim of the present study was to find out whether a more vulnerable population, asthmatics, would demonstrate similar or other changes in the lungs or in the peripheral blood. Sixteen mild asthmatics were exposed to a subway and a control environment for 2 h while being monitored by measurements of lung function, and inflammatory response in the lower airways evaluated by bronchoscopy and in peripheral blood. An attempt to standardize the exposures was done, by letting the volunteers alternate 15 min intervals of moderate exercise on a bicycle ergometer with 15 min of rest. We found a statistically significant increased frequency of CD4 cells expressing T-cell activation marker CD25 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, but no significant increase of regulatory T-cells in blood as was found in healthy volunteers. Our study shows that airway inflammatory responses after exposure in subway environment differ between asthmatic and healthy humans.},

Background
Autopsy studies show that smoking contributes to airway wall hyperplasia and narrowing of the airway lumen. Studies of smoking and airway measures on computed tomography (CT) scan are limited to case-control studies of measures that combine airway lumen and wall thickness.
Objectives
We hypothesized that cumulative cigarette smoking would be associated with increased airway wall thickness in a large, population-based cohort.
Methods
The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis enrolled participants age 45–84 years from the general population. Smoking history was assessed via standardized questionnaire items; current smoking was confirmed in half the cohort with cotinine. Airway lumen and wall thickness were measured in two dimensions in posterior basal segmental bronchi on cardiac-gated CT scans. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, genetic ancestry, education, height, weight, asthma history, particulate matter, scanner type, and scanner current.
Results
Half of the 7898 participants had smoked and 14% were current smokers. Pack-years of smoking were associated with thicker airway walls (mean increase 0.002 mm per ten pack-years [95% CI: 0.00002, 0.004] p = 0.03). Current smoking was associated with narrower airway lumens (mean decrease −0.11 mm [95% CI: −0.2, −0.02] p = 0.02). There was no evidence that either association was modified by genetic ancestry, and findings persisted among participants without clinical disease.
Conclusions
Long-term cigarette smoking was associated with subclinical increases in wall thickness of sub-segmental airways whereas current smoking was associated with narrower airway lumen diameters. Smoking may contribute to airway wall thickening prior to the development of overt chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.},

Background
New lymphatic vessels are associated with tissue injury and repair. Recent studies have shown increased lymphatic follicles formation in the lungs of COPD patients. We hypothesized that lymphatic vascular remodeling could be part of COPD pathogenesis.
Aim
To investigate the lymphangiogenetic process in COPD we measured the lymphatic microvessel density (LMVD), the lymphatic invasion (L.I), and their correlation with clinical and laboratory parameters.
Methods
Lung tissue from 20 COPD patients and 20 non-COPD smokers was immunohistochemically stained for D2-40 (lymphatic endothelial cell marker), and LYVE-1 (lymphatic endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1). Both groups had similar age and smoking history.
Results
D2-40 and LYVE-1 were expressed in all specimens. Lymphatic invasion was presented only in COPD specimens. Lymphatic microvessel density (LMVD) as revealed by D2-40 and LYVE-1 markers was statistically significantly higher in COPD patients when compared with non-COPD smokers. Both markers (D2-40, LYVE-1) were correlated with FEV1 (% pred) (R2 = 0.415, R2 = 0.605, respectively).
Conclusions
We report for the first time high lymphatic microvessel density and lymphatic invasion in COPD patients, related to the degree of airway obstruction. Our findings could provide novel insights in the pathogenesis of the disease.},

The impact of occupational dust and gas/fume exposure on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in developing countries has not been quantified. We examined the relationship between past dust and fume exposure and prevalence of COPD and respiratory symptoms in a cross-sectional analysis of a large Chinese population sample. Participants in the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (n = 8216; 27.3% men, mean age 61.9 ± 6.8 years) had spirometry and a structured interview including exposures, symptoms, and lifestyle. Self-reported intensity and duration of dust and gas/fume exposure was used to derive cumulative exposure. COPD was diagnosed from spirometry using lower limit of normal based on prediction equations. COPD was associated with high exposure to dust or gas/fume (exposed: 87/1206 v non-exposed: 191/3853; adjusted odds ratio: 1.41; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06, 1.87) with no evidence of effect modification by smoking. Respiratory symptoms were associated with exposures to dust and gas/fume, with adjusted odds ratios for chronic cough/phlegm of 1.57 (1.13, 2.17) and 1.39 (1.20, 1.60) for dyspnoea. The overall population attributable fraction for COPD due to occupational exposure was 10.4% (95% CI -0.9%, 19.5%). Occupational dust and gas/fume exposure is associated with an increased prevalence of COPD in this Chinese sample, independent of smoking. The population attributable fraction in Chinese is similar to that in Western populations.},

Although COPD is a debilitating pulmonary condition, many studies have shown awareness of the disease to be low. This article presents data on attitudes and beliefs about COPD in subjects with respiratory symptoms participating in the BREATHE study in the Middle East and North Africa region. This study was a large general population survey of COPD conducted in ten countries of the region (Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey and United Arab Emirates), together with Pakistan, using a standardised methodology. A total of 62,086 subjects were screened, of whom 2,187 fulfilled the “epidemiological” definition of COPD. A detailed questionnaire was administered to these subjects, which documented knowledge about the disease, attitudes to care, beliefs about COPD and satisfaction with treatment. 1,392 subjects were analysable. Overall, 58.6% of subjects claimed to be very well or adequately informed about their respiratory condition. Two-thirds of subjects reported receiving information about COPD from their physician and 10.6% from television; the internet was cited by 6% and other health professionals or patient associations by < 1%. Several inappropriate beliefs were identified, with 38.9% of respondents believing that there were no truly effective treatments, 73.7% believing that their respiratory condition would get progressively worse regardless of treatment and 29.6% being unsure what had caused their respiratory problems. Although 81% of respondents believed that smoking was the cause of most cases of COPD in general, only 51% accepted that it was the cause of their own respiratory problems. Treatment satisfaction was relatively high, with 83.2% of respondents somewhat or very satisfied with their physician's management, in spite of the fact that only 47.5% considered that their physician's advice had helped them manage their respiratory symptoms a lot. In conclusion, awareness of COPD in the region is suboptimal and treatment expectations are undervalued. Better patient education and more effective patient–physician communication are clearly required.},

Metals concentrations in different fractions and locations were studied. Metals sources were identified by cluster and primary component analysis. The potential risk to human health was assessed by human exposure model. Results showed that Zn, Mn, Pb and Cu were higher in all the three fractions. V, Cr, Mn and Co ranged close to the background values of Chinese soil indicating that they were mainly from crustal materials. Concentrations of Zn, Mn, Pb, V, Cr, Ni, Co and Cd were higher in old district than that in new district for the three fractions. The PM2.5/PM10, PM10/PM100 and PM2.5/PM100 ratios were higher for Zn, Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, As and Cr (all higher than 1.0), and lower for Co, Mn and V (all less than or close to 1.0) which meant that anthropologic sources associated metals were more easily accumulated in finer particles than metals from crustal materials. Spatial variations indicated that the ten metals peaked at surroundings near railway station, gas stations, industrial boilers and machine manufacturing plant implying the influence of local vehicle emission, fossil fuel combustion and industrial activities as well as crustal materials which was verified by cluster analysis and primary component analysis results. Ingestion of dust particles appeared to be the main route of exposure to re-suspended dust. Hazard Indexes of As were both highest for children and adult which could be a potential threat to human health for non-cancer effect and it also exhibited the highest values for cancer effect as 1.01E-06, 7.04E-07 and 7.21E-07 for PM2.5, PM10 and PM100, respectively.},

Additionally, particulate matter smaller than 2.5μm (PM2.5) was included in the study (February 2005–September 2007, n=32). A chemical sequential extraction scheme according to Fernández Espinosa et al. (2002) was applied to assess the speciation and potential mobility of the elements. Four different fractions were distinguished, which can be classified as: (f1) water-extractable, (f2) bound to carbonates, oxides and reducible metals, (f3) bound to organic matter, oxidisable and sulfidic metals, and (f4) residual fraction. The chemical speciation results illustrated that potential toxic metals like Zn (41%), Cd (40%), Mn (32%), and As (29%) were detectable to a high percentage in the water-soluble fraction (f1) of TSP samples and consequently are especially harmful to the environment and exposed people. Lead and Cu in TSP samples showed highest extractability in fraction f2 (53% and 23%, respectively) and can also be considered as mobile with a negative impact on the environment and the human health. Fine particles (PM2.5) showed comparable results with sometimes higher percentages in the highly mobile fraction f1, for example for As (52%). Anthropogenic sources, such as industry and traffic, played an important role for overall atmospheric pollution throughout the year. Additionally, these more or less constant emissions were superimposed by seasonal sources, especially coal combustion in winter and geogenic dust in spring. Coal combustion proved to be a source especially relevant for the toxic and mobile elements Cd, As and Pb.

   abstract = {Evidence continues to emerge showing that poor Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) can cause illness requiring absence from schools, and can cause acute health symptoms that decrease students’ performance. Since children spend on average 7–11 h per weekday at school, the IAQ in classrooms is expected to play a key role in the assessment of the effects of their personal exposure to air pollution. Within this context the present study was conducted in order to fulfill three primary objectives 1) to measure the levels and the element composition of PM2.5 and PM2.5–10, in three primary schools placed in Lisbon, in order to assess the children exposure to these pollutants; 2) to study the relationship between indoor and outdoor atmospheric particles concentrations and 3) to investigate the sources of high aerosols concentrations in classrooms. In the studied classrooms, the concentrations of coarse particles significantly exceeded the ambient levels. Element concentrations suggested that the physical activity of students highly contributed to the re-suspension of sedimented particles. The high levels of CO2 indicated that in these schools the ventilation was inadequate. This fact contributed to the establishment of poor IAQ.},

Air pollution data, collected at 113 sites (spread across Delhi and its neighboring areas) from July–December 2003, were used to compute exposure at the place of residence of 3989 subjects. A socio-economic and respiratory health survey was administered in 1576 households. This survey collected time-use, residence histories, demographic information, and direct measurements of lung function with subjects. The optimal interpolation methods were used to link air pollution and respiratory health data at the place of their residence. Resident histories, in combination with secondary data, were used to impute cumulative exposure prior to the air-quality interventions, and the effects of recent air quality measures on lung function were then evaluated. Three important findings emerge from the analysis. First, the interventions were associated with a significant improvement in respiratory health. Second, the effect of these interventions varied significantly by gender and income. Third, consistent with a causal interpretation of these results, effects were the strongest among those individuals who spend a disproportionate share of their time out-of-doors.},

   abstract = {Particulate pollution is an environmental concern that is widespread and difficult to resolve. Recently various regulatory improvements around the world have been agreed upon to tackle this problem, especially as related to the fine fraction of particulates, which more closely correlates to human health effects than other fractions. The size-fractionation of inhalable particles and their organic composition represent a new area of research that has been poorly explored thus far. Endotoxins are a type of natural organic compound that can be found in particulate matter. They are correlated with Gram-negative bacterial contamination. Health outcomes associated with exposure to these toxins are not specific and often overlap with the health effects of PM (Particulate Matter) exposure, including asthma, bronchitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and organic dust toxic syndrome. Very little information is available on the endotoxin distribution in different PM10 size fractions. This study examined PM10 size fractions and their endotoxin content. Sampling was conducted at five different locations: one urban, two rural and two rural sites that were highly influenced by large-scale farm animal production facilities. For each location, six different PM10 fractions were evaluated. PM10 sub-fractions were categorised as follows: PM10–7.2 (1.15–31.30 μg m−3); PM7.2–3.0 (1.86–30.73 μg m−3); PM3.0–1.5 (1.74–13.90 μg m−3); PM1.5–0.95 (0.24–10.57 μg m−3); PM0.95–0.49 (1.22–14.33 μg m−3) and PM<0.49 (13.15–85.49 μg m−3). The ranges of endotoxin levels determined were: PM10–7.2 (0.051–5.401 endotoxin units (EU) m−3); PM7.2–3.0 (0.123–7.801 EU m−3); PM3.0–1.5 (0.057–1.635 EU m−3); PM1.5–0.95 (0.040–2.477 EU m−3); PM0.95–0.49 (0.007–3.159 EU m−3) and PM<0.49 (0.039–3.975 EU m−3). Our results indicated consistency of the PM1 fraction at all of the sites and the predominant presence of endotoxins in the coarse fraction. The observed abatement of the PM10 and endotoxin levels was very high (above 1:10) as little as 50 m from the pollution source. This kind of model is useful to both improve our knowledge about PM10 endotoxin distribution and to evaluate the potential risks for the health of neighbouring populations.},

   abstract = {The “Provence Alpes Côte d’Azur” (PACA) region, in the South East of France, is one of Europe’s regions most influenced by the atmospheric pollution. During the last 15 years, the industrial emissions decrease caused an evolution of the atmospheric pollution nature. Nowadays, atmospheric pollution is more and more influenced by the road traffic, the dominating pollution source in urban zones for the PACA region. Combined with this intense road traffic, the strong hot season of the Mediterranean climate contributes to the region bad air quality; it is known to be one of the worse in Europe. The recognized air pollution effects over public health include increased risk of hospital admissions and mortality by respiratory or cardiovascular diseases. The combination of these serious pollution related health hazards with senior and children vulnerabilities leads to serious sanitary concerns. Over the 1990–2005 period, we obtained, using the non-parametric Mann–Kendall test from annual mortality dataset (CépiDC), decreasing trends for Asthma (−5.00%year−1), Cardiovascular (−0.73%year−1), Ischemic (−0.69%year−1) and cerebrovascular diseases (−3.10%year−1). However, for “Other heart diseases” (+0.10%year−1) and “Respiratory” (+0.10%year−1) an increase was observed. The development of an adequate tool to understand impacts of pollution levels is of utmost importance. Different pollutants have different health endpoints, information may be lost through the use of a single index consequently, in this study we present the modified formula of air quality index, based on Cairncross’s concept the Aggregate Risk Index (ARI). ARI is based on the relative risk of the well-established increased daily mortality, or morbidity, enabling an assessment of additive effects of short-term exposure to the main air pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, SO2, O3 and NO2 in order to account for the reality of the multiple exposures impacts of chemical agents. The ARI, developed per pathology, takes into account the possible adverse effects associated with the coexistence of all pollutants. This index will enable to communicate the health risks associated, from modelled or monitored pollutant concentrations, to the general population. The second step will consist in the construction of a prediction model of this sanitary index.},

   abstract = {Development of strategies to control urban air pollution is a complex and multi–disciplinary process. In most real life cases, relevant policy making is characterised by the lack of information related to the economic value of the health consequences attributed to air pollution. This information is important to possess reliable economic estimates for the benefit arising from the application of the proposed strategies. This paper presents a contingent valuation approach in order to elicit the willingness–to–pay (WTP) for reducing the risk of premature mortality attributed to air pollution based on an easy–to–comprehend questionnaire. The economic value of increasing life expectancy by saving one year of life loss through improving air quality is estimated for Thessaloniki, Greece, which is considered one of the most polluted –if not the most polluted– cities within Europe, especially with respect to airborne particles. A sample of approximately 800 residents was chosen and a face–to–face interview was conducted using a hypothetical open–ended question designed to elicit the respondents WTP. Change in life expectancy was well understood and the results showed that 78.2% of respondents were able to express their WTP. The mean WTP to save one Year of Life Loss (YOLL) is approximately 920 € per person per year, which corresponds to a Value of a Life Year (VOLY) that is approximately 41 000 €.},

In particular, differences in the response to elevated temperatures between urban and rural areas were investigated. Generalized additive models (GAMs) for daily death counts, adjusted for trend, season, day of the month and age were separately fitted for urban and rural areas. Breakpoint models were applied for determining the increase in mortality above and below a threshold (equivalent) temperature. Generally, a ’V’-shaped (equivalent) temperature–mortality curve with increasing mortality at low and high temperatures was observed. Particularly, urban areas suffered from heat-related mortality with a steep increase above a specific threshold. This adverse heat effect may well increase with ongoing urbanization and the intensification of the urban heat island due to the densification of building structures. Moreover, rising temperatures due to climate change could aggravate thermal stress.},

The effects of prenatal exposure to environmental levels of dioxins on immune function during infancy have not been clarified, although dioxins induce immunosuppression in offspring of animals. Moreover, human studies have not assessed the effects of gender- or congener-specific differences. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between dioxin levels in maternal blood and the risk of infection and allergies in infancy. We examined 364 mothers and their infants enrolled in a Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health between 2002 and 2005 in Sapporo, Japan. Relevant information was collected from a baseline questionnaire during pregnancy, medical records at delivery, and a follow-up questionnaire when the child was 18 months of age that assessed development of allergies and infections in infancy. Dioxin-like compound levels in maternal blood were measured with high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. Relatively higher levels of polychlorinated dibenzofuran were associated with a significantly increased risk of otitis media, especially among male infants (odds ratio=2.5, 95% confidence interval=1.1–5.9). Relatively higher levels of 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran were also associated with a significantly increased risk of otitis media (odds ratio=5.3, 95% confidence interval=1.5–19). However, we observed a weak association between dioxin-like compound levels and allergic symptoms in infancy. At environmental levels, prenatal exposure to dioxin-like compounds may alter immune function and increase the risk of infections in infancy, especially among males. The compound 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran may be responsible for this.},

   abstract = {The Talamanca County in Costa Rica has large-scale banana and small-scale plantain production, probably causing pesticide exposure in indigenous children. We explored to what extent different community actors are aware of children's pesticide hazards and how their awareness related to socio-economical and cultural conditions. Methods comprised eight focus groups with fathers and mothers separately, 27 semi-structured interviews to key actors, and field observations. As a whole, the indigenous plantain farmers and banana plantation workers had some general knowledge of pesticides concerning crop protection, but little on acute health effects, and hardly any on exposure routes and pathways, and chronic effects. People expressed vague ideas about pesticide risks. Inter-community differences were related to pesticide technologies used in banana and plantain production, employment status on a multinational plantation versus smallholder status, and gender. Compared to formalized practices on transnational company plantations, where workers reported to feel protected, pesticide handling by plantain smallholders was not perceived as hazardous and therefore no safety precautions were applied. Large-scale monoculture was perceived as one of the most important problems leading to pesticide risks in Talamanca on banana plantations, and also on neighboring small plantain farms extending into large areas. Plantain farmers have adopted use of highly toxic pesticides following banana production, but in conditions of extreme poverty. Aerial spraying in banana plantations was considered by most social actors a major determinant of exposure for the population living nearby these plantations, including vulnerable children. We observed violations of legally established aerial spraying distances. Economic considerations were most mentioned as the underlying reason for the pesticide use: economic needs to obtain the production quantity and quality, and pressure to use pesticides by other economic agents such as middlemen. Risk perceptions were modulated by factors such as people's tasks and positions in the production process, gender, and people's possibilities to define their own social conditions (more fatalistic perceptions among banana workers). The challenge for the future is to combine these insights into improved health risk assessment and management that is culturally adequate for each particular community and agricultural context.},

We included 41 schoolchildren, 8–12 years old, who had been diagnosed with atopic dermatitis. For 67 consecutive days, all of them measured their symptoms in a diary. To assess exposure, the daily ambient mass concentrations of particulate matter less than 10, 2.5 and 1μm (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1, respectively) and concentrations of submicron particles (0.01–1μm) were measured at a local school. The mean mass concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 were 74.0, 57.8 and 50.8μg/m3, respectively. The mean concentrations were 41,335/cm3 ultrafine particles (UFPs) and 8577/cm3 accumulation mode (0.1–1μm) particles. Significant associations were found between the concentrations of ultrafine particles and the itchiness symptom in children with atopic dermatitis. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in previous day ultrafine particles concentration (IQR: 28–140/m3) was significantly associated with a 3.1% (95% confidence interval, 0.2–6.1) increase in the itch symptom score for children with atopic dermatitis. The results suggested that the concentration of ambient ultrafine particles may exacerbate skin symptoms in children with atopic dermatitis.},

We studied 749 school beginners living in four Ni-polluted industrial areas of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. We assessed Ni in ambient air, Ni in urine from children and mothers, and Ni in tap water, conducted patch tests in children (including the NiSO4-dilution test) and collected questionnaire data. Statistics were done by linear and logistic regression analyses, adjusted for covariates. At increased Ni concentration in ambient air (unit of increase: 10ng/m3), urinary Ni concentrations rose in both mothers (9.1%; 95% CI: 6.8–11.4%) and children (2.4%; 95% CI: 0.4–4.4%). The prevalence of Ni sensitization in children was associated with increased Ni from ambient air (unit of increase: 18ng/m3; odds ratio 1.28; 95% CI: 1.25–1.32) and urinary Ni concentration (unit of increase: 7.1μg/L; odds ratio 2.4; 95% CI: 1.20–4.48).

In vitro studies of the effects of air pollution on human cells help to establish conditions for the analysis of cause–effect relationships. One of the major challenges is to test native atmosphere in its complexity, rather than the various components individually. We have developed an in vitro system in which human monocyte-macrophage U937 cells are directly exposed to filters containing different amounts of PM10 collected in the city of Rome. Transcriptional profiling obtained after short exposure (1h) of cells to a filter containing 1666μg PM10 (77.6μg/cm2) using a macroarray panel of 1176 genes reveals a significant change in the mRNA level (>2 fold) for 87 genes relative to cells exposed to a control filter. Overall, 9 out of 87 modulated genes were annotated as “lung cancer”. qRT-PCR confirmed the induction of relevant genes involved in DNA repair and apoptosis, specifically: ERCC1, TDG, DAD1 and MCL1. In cells exposed for 10min, 1h and 3h to different amounts of PM10, transcription of TNFα and TRAP1, which code for a key pro-inflammatory cytokine and a mitochondrial protein involved in cell protection from oxidative stress, respectively, was shown to be modulated in a time-dependent, but not a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these data indicate that it is possible to analyze the effects of untreated particulate matter on human cells by the direct-exposure approach we have developed, possibly providing new clues to traffic-related health hazard.},

Municipal solid waste landfills are sources of air pollution that may affect the health and quality of life of neighboring communities.
Objectives
To investigate health and quality of life concerns of neighbors related to landfill air pollution.
Methods
Landfill neighbors were enrolled and kept twice-daily diaries for 14d about odor intensity, alteration of daily activities, mood states, and irritant and other physical symptoms between January and November 2009. Concurrently, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) air measurements were recorded every 15-min. Relationships between H2S, odor, and health outcomes were evaluated using conditional fixed effects regression models.
Results
Twenty-three participants enrolled and completed 878 twice-daily diary entries. H2S measurements were recorded over a period of 80d and 1-h average H2S=0.22ppb (SD=0.27; range: 0–2.30ppb). Landfill odor increased 0.63 points (on 5-point Likert-type scale) for every 1ppb increase in hourly average H2S when the wind was blowing from the landfill towards the community (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.29, 0.91). Odor was strongly associated with reports of alteration of daily activities (odds ratio (OR)=9.0; 95% CI: 3.5, 23.5), negative mood states (OR=5.2; 95% CI: 2.8, 9.6), mucosal irritation (OR=3.7; 95% CI=2.0, 7.1) and upper respiratory symptoms (OR=3.9; 95% CI: 2.2, 7.0), but not positive mood states (OR=0.6; 95% CI: 0.2, 1.5) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (OR=1.0; 95% CI: 0.4, 2.6).
Conclusions
Results suggest air pollutants from a regional landfill negatively impact the health and quality of life of neighbors.},

The objectives of the present study were to provide quantitative data on the impact of air pollution on the health of people living in two small municipalities in a highly industrialized, densely populated area of Northern Italy. We applied the approach proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) using the AirQ 2.2.3 software developed by the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health, Bilthoven Division. Daily concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter ≤10μm (PM10) and ≤2.5μm (PM2.5) were used to assess human exposure and health effects in terms of attributable proportion of the health outcome, annual number of excess cases of mortality for all causes, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Long-term effects were estimated for PM2.5 as years of life lost. Considering short-term effects, PM2.5 had the highest health impact on the 24,000 inhabitants of the two small towns, causing an excess of total mortality of 8 out of 177 in a year. Ozone and nitrogen dioxide each caused about three excess cases of total mortality. Results on long-term effects showed, respectively, 433, 180, and 72 years of life lost for mortality for all causes, cardiopulmonary diseases and lung cancer, in a year. These results are consistent with other reports of the impact of air quality on human health and the AirQ software seems an effective and easy tool, helpful in decision-making.},

   abstract = {Background
El Paso County (Texas) is prone to still air inversions and is one of the dust “hot spots” in North America. In this context, we examined the sub-lethal effects of airborne dust and low wind events on human respiratory health (i.e., asthma and acute bronchitis) between 2000 and 2003, when 110 dust and 157 low wind events occurred. Because environmental conditions may not affect everyone the same, we explored the effects of dust and low wind within three age groups (children, adults, and the elderly), testing for effect modifications by sex and insurance status, while controlling for weather and air pollutants.
Methods
We used a case-crossover design using events matched with referent days on the same day-of-the-week, month, and year with conditional logistic regression to estimate the probability of hospital admission, while controlling for apparent temperature (lag 1), nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter of 2.5μm or less.
Results
Children (aged 1–17) were 1.19 (95% confidence interval: 1.00–1.41) times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma three days after a low wind event, and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.01–1.75) times more likely to be hospitalized for acute bronchitis one day after a dust event than on a clear day. Girls were more sensitive to acute bronchitis hospitalizations after dust events (1.83, 95% CI: 1.09–3.08) than boys, but less sensitive than boys to acute bronchitis hospitalizations after low wind events (0.68, 95% CI: 0.46−1.00). We found general trends with regard to dust and low wind events being associated with increased odds of hospitalization for asthma and bronchitis amongst all ages and adults (aged 18–64). Adults covered by Medicaid and adults without health insurance had higher risks of hospitalization for asthma and acute bronchitis after both low wind and dust events.
Conclusions
Results suggest that there were respiratory health effects associated with dust and low wind events in El Paso, with stronger impacts among children and poor adults. Girls and boys with acute bronchitis were differentially sensitive to dust and low wind events.},

Urban air pollutants are associated with cardiovascular events. Traffic controllers are at high risk for pollution exposure during outdoor work shifts.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between air pollution and systemic blood pressure in traffic controllers during their work shifts.
Methods
This cross-sectional study enrolled 19 male traffic controllers from Santo André city (São Paulo, Brazil) who were 30–60 years old and exposed to ambient air during outdoor work shifts. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were measured every 15min by an Ambulatory Arterial Blood Pressure Monitoring device. Hourly measurements (lags of 0–5h) and the moving averages (2–5h) of particulate matter (PM10), ozone (O3) ambient concentrations and the acquired daily minimum temperature and humidity means from the São Paulo State Environmental Agency were correlated with both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Statistical methods included descriptive analysis and linear mixed effect models adjusted for temperature, humidity, work periods and time of day.
Results
Interquartile increases of PM10 (33μg/m3) and O3 (49μg/m3) levels were associated with increases in all arterial pressure parameters, ranging from 1.06 to 2.53mmHg. PM10 concentration was associated with early effects (lag 0), mainly on systolic blood pressure. However, O3 was weakly associated most consistently with diastolic blood pressure and with late cumulative effects.
Conclusions
Santo André traffic controllers presented higher blood pressure readings while working their outdoor shifts during periods of exposure to ambient pollutant fluctuations. However, PM10 and O3 induced cardiovascular effects demonstrated different time courses and end-point behaviors and probably acted through different mechanisms.},

Extreme air pollution events due to bushfire smoke and dust storms are expected to increase as a consequence of climate change, yet little has been published about their population health impacts. We examined the association between air pollution events and mortality in Sydney from 1997 to 2004.
Methods
Events were defined as days for which the 24h city-wide concentration of PM10 exceeded the 99th percentile. All events were researched and categorised as being caused by either smoke or dust. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression modelling adjusted for influenza epidemics, same day and lagged temperature and humidity. Reported odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals are for mortality on event days compared with non-event days. The contribution of elevated average temperatures to mortality during smoke events was explored.
Results
There were 52 event days, 48 attributable to bushfire smoke, six to dust and two affected by both. Smoke events were associated with a 5% increase in non-accidental mortality at a lag of 1 day OR (95% confidence interval (CI)) 1.05 (95%CI: 1.00–1.10). When same day temperature was removed from the model, additional same day associations were observed with non-accidental mortality OR 1.05 (95%CI: 1.00–1.09), and with cardiovascular mortality OR (95%CI) 1.10 (95%CI: 1.00–1.20). Dust events were associated with a 15% increase in non-accidental mortality at a lag of 3 days, OR (95%CI) 1.16 (95%CI: 1.03–1.30).
Conclusions
The magnitude and temporal patterns of association with mortality were different for smoke and dust events. Public health advisories during bushfire smoke pollution episodes should include advice about hot weather in addition to air pollution.},

Maternal exposure to air pollution has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Few studies took into account the spatial and temporal variation of air pollution levels.
Objectives
To evaluate the impact of maternal exposure to traffic-related air pollution during pregnancy on preterm birth and term birth weight using a spatio-temporal exposure model.
Methods
We estimated maternal residential exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5) and soot during pregnancy (entire pregnancy, 1st trimester, and last month) for 3853 singleton births within the Dutch PIAMA prospective birth cohort study by means of temporally adjusted land-use regression models. Associations between air pollution concentrations and preterm birth and term birth weight were analyzed by means of logistic and linear regression models with and without adjustment for maternal physical, lifestyle, and socio-demographic characteristics.
Results
We found positive, statistically non-significant associations between exposure to soot during entire pregnancy and during the last month of pregnancy and preterm birth [adj. OR (95% CI) per interquartile range increase in exposure 1.08 (0.88–1.34) and 1.09 (0.93–1.27), respectively]. There was no indication of an adverse effect of air pollution exposure on term birth weight.
Conclusions
In this study, maternal exposure to traffic-related air pollution during pregnancy was not associated with term birth weight. There was a tendency towards an increased risk of preterm birth with increasing air pollution exposure, but statistical power was low.},

   abstract = {Background
Daily variations in the levels of air pollution are well known to be associated with daily variations in mortality counts. Given the large number of time-series studies, there is little need for simple replication of these results in additional locations. However, additional analyses of time-series data might be useful in elucidating remaining questions on the role of air pollution on mortality.
Objectives
Because of ongoing issues related to causality, changing toxicity, the difficulty in isolating the independent effects of individual pollutants, the availability of new methods to detect effect thresholds, and questions about the extent to which effects are restricted to frail members of the population, additional analyses of time-series data might be helpful in addressing these issues. We show an example where additional time-series analyses can be helpful in elucidating specific questions in the field of air pollution epidemiology.
Methods
We analysed daily mortality and air pollution data using Poisson regression in generalised additive models. Air pollution data for the overall period 1992–2006 and for four different periods were analysed to assess the overall risk estimates for the whole period and to assess variability over time for the different effect estimates.
Results and Conclusion
We found some statistically significant upward trends, but this was only the case for a few associations without a consistent pattern over the cause-specific deaths. Whether these findings are consistent over time or whether our findings are merely the result of statistical chance can only be elucidated by continuation of monitoring of the relative risks over time in the future. Although these results may indicate that both photochemical and particulate matter air pollution might have become more toxic, the lack of a clear pattern in the results makes these conclusions speculative.},

   abstract = {Exposures to ambient air traffic-related pollutants and their sources have been associated with respiratory and asthma morbidity in children. However, longitudinal investigation of the effects of traffic-related exposures during early childhood is limited. We examined associations of residential proximity and density of traffic and stationary sources of air pollution with wheeze, asthma, and immunoglobulin (Ig) E among New York City children between birth and age 5 years. Subjects included 593 Dominican and African American participants from the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health cohort. Prenatally, through age 5 years, residential and respiratory health data were collected every 3–6 months. At ages 2, 3, and 5 years, serum IgE was measured. Spatial data on the proximity and density of roadways and built environment were collected for a 250m buffer around subjects' homes. Associations of wheeze, asthma, total IgE, and allergen-specific IgE with prenatal, earlier childhood, and concurrent exposures to air pollution sources were analyzed using generalized estimating equations or logistic regression. In repeated measures analyses, concurrent residential density of four-way intersections was associated significantly with wheeze (odds ratio: 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.57). Age 1 exposures also were associated with wheeze at subsequent ages. Concurrent proximity to highway was associated more strongly with total IgE (ratio of the geometric mean levels: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.42) than were prenatal or earlier childhood exposures. Positive associations also were observed between percent commercial building area and asthma, wheeze, and IgE and between proximity to stationary sources of air pollution and asthma. Longitudinal investigation suggests that among Dominican and African American children living in Northern Manhattan and South Bronx during ages 0–5 years, residence in neighborhoods with high density of traffic and industrial facilities may contribute to chronic respiratory morbidity, and concurrent, prenatal, and earlier childhood exposures may be important. These findings may have broad implications for other urban populations that commonly have high asthma prevalence and exposure to a high density of traffic and stationary air pollution sources.},

We quantified the relative contributions to PM2.5 from both secondhand smoke and infiltrating outdoor sources in US casinos. We measured real-time PM2.5, particulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PPAH), and carbon dioxide (CO2) (as an index of ventilation rate) inside and outside 8 casinos in Reno, Nevada. We combined these data with data from previous studies, yielding a total of 66 US casinos with smoking in California, Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, developing PM2.5 frequency distributions, with 3 nonsmoking casinos for comparison. Geometric means for PM2.5 were 53.8μg/m3 (range 18.5–205μg/m3) inside smoking casinos, 4.3μg/m3 (range 0.26–29.7μg/m3) outside those casinos, and 3.1μg/m3 (range 0.6–9μg/m3) inside 3 nonsmoking casinos. In a subset of 21 Reno and Las Vegas smoking casinos, PM2.5 in gaming areas averaged 45.2μg/m3 (95% CI, 37.7–52.7μg/m3); adjacent nonsmoking casino restaurants averaged 27.2μg/m3 (95% CI, 17.5–36.9μg/m3), while PM2.5 outside the casinos averaged 3.9μg/m3 (95% CI, 2.5–5.3μg/m3). For a subset of 10 Nevada and Pennsylvania smoking casinos, incremental (indoor–outdoor) PM2.5 was correlated with incremental PPAH (R2=0.79), with ventilation rate-adjusted smoker density (R2=0.73), and with smoker density (R2=0.60), but not with ventilation rates (R2=0.15). PPAH levels in 8 smoking casinos in 3 states averaged 4 times outdoors. The nonsmoking casinos' PM2.5 (n=3) did not differ from outdoor levels, nor did their PPAH (n=2). Incremental PM2.5 from secondhand smoke in approximately half the smoking casinos exceeded a level known to produce cardiovascular morbidity in nonsmokers after less than 2h of exposure, posing acute health risks to patrons and workers. Casino ventilation and air cleaning practices failed to control secondhand smoke PM2.5. Drifting PM2.5 from secondhand smoke contaminated unseparated nonsmoking areas. Smoke-free casinos reduced PM2.5 to the same low levels found outdoors.},

In terms of tracheobronchial deposition, the corresponding values for daily particle number and surface area for all age groups was equal to 6.5 × 1010 particles and 9.9 × 1014 μm2, respectively.

The data set used covers a nine-year period (1999–2007) and is unique in the sense that it includes—besides the daily number of respiratory hospital admissions—not just the hourly mean concentrations of CO, PM10, NO, NO2, O3 and SO2 with meteorological variables (temperature, global solar flux, relative humidity, air pressure and wind speed), but two pollen variables (Ambrosia and total pollen excluding Ambrosia) as well. The analysis was performed using three age categories for the pollen season of Ambrosia and the pollen-free season. Meteorological elements and air pollutants are clustered in order to define optimum environmental conditions of high patient numbers. ANOVA was then used to determine whether cluster-related mean patient numbers differ significantly. Furthermore, two novel procedures are applied here: factor analysis including a special transformation and a time-varying multivariate linear regression that makes it possible to determine the rank of importance of the influencing variables in respiratory hospital admissions, and also compute the relative importance of the parameters affecting respiratory disorders. Both techniques revealed that Ambrosia pollen is an important variable that influences hospital admissions (an increase of 10 pollen grains m−3 can imply an increase of around 24% in patient numbers). The role of chemical and meteorological parameters is also significant, but their weights vary according to the seasons and the methods. Clearer results are obtained for the pollination season of Ambrosia. Here, a 10 μg m−3 increase in O3 implies a patient number response from −17% to +11%. Wind speed is a surprisingly important variable, where a 1 m s−1 rise may result in a hospital admission reduction of up to 42–45%.},

To access the relationship between the frequency of hospitalizations due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and air pollution.
Material-method
Time series study during a seven year period (2001–2007) in a semi-urban tourist Greek peninsula. Data were collected from the computerized database of Volos General Hospital and included on a daily basis all emergency admissions of adults (>14 years old) which required hospitalization due to respiratory or cardiovascular problems. Daily concentrations of ambient pollutants [particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mm (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NO, NO2, NOX) and ozone (O3)] were obtained from three monitoring stations. The impact of air pollutants on morbidity was studied through time series analysis. The effects of time trend, season, and other cyclical factors, temperature, and humidity were accounted for. Autocorrelation and overdispersion were corrected.
Results
There were significant associations between hospitalizations and all indicators of air pollution. Daily elevations in the concentrations of PM10, NO, CO and O3 increased significantly the number of hospitalizations for respiratory/cardiovascular causes both on the same day and at the next day (p < 0.05). Combined increase of CO and O3 and of PM10 and CO was associated with even higher hospitalization rates.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest a significant relationship between morbidity burden of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and the levels of air pollution; these results underline that reinforcement of measures which target to control ambient pollution, is necessary.},

The purpose of this survey was to compare the pulmonary function of children living in urban area of Tirana city with children living in suburban area of the city.
Material and methods
This survey is carried out during 2004–2005 period on 238 children living in urban area and in 72 children living in suburban area, measuring dynamic pulmonary function. A questionnaire was used to collect data on sex, current respiratory symptoms, allergy diagnosed by the physician, parent education and smoking habit of parents, presence of animals, synthetic carpets and moulds in their houses. The selection of schools, and children included in this survey was done by randomized method. Also, we have measured and classic air pollutants.
Results
Comparing the results of values of pulmonary function of two groups of children, we have shown that differences were significant (p 0.001), whereas comparing symptoms were for cough (p 0.011) and for phlegm (p 0.032). The level of particulate matter (PM10) and total suspended matter (TSP) were over the recommended limit values, whereas the levels of other pollutants have resulted within recommended levels of World Health Organization (WHO)
Conclusions
The results of this survey suggest that air pollution is associated with respiratory health of children causing a slight decrease in values of pulmonary function in children of urban area compared with those of suburban area.},

   abstract = {Biomass fuels are frequently used as a source of domestic energy in developing countries that may cause indoor air pollution. This study presents indoor and outdoor combustion pollutants (CO and NOx) and respirable particulate matter–RSPM (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0) concentrations measured during winter and summer seasons in 8 homes in Delhi, India. CO2 concentrations have been used to measure the outdoor airflow rates. This study further investigates variations in indoor/outdoor concentrations of the pollutants as a result of various activities in commercial (Site I) and institutional areas (Site II). The institutional area has been considered as the control site. Monitoring has been conducted at each site for 3 days in a week in both summer and winter seasons to investigate the diurnal variations of pollutant concentrations. Then, the I/O ratios have also been estimated. The correlation analysis of indoor pollutant concentrations with outdoor concentrations has been carried out. Winter/Summer (W/S) ratios have also been calculated and a two tailed t–test has been used to determine whether the winter and summer mean concentrations are significantly higher. The I/O ratios for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0 at Site I homes, in winter season, have been found to be 1.43±0.84, 2.72±1.94 and 3.21±2.39, respectively. I/O ratio for CO has been found to be 2.99±2.19 in winters at Site I. The linear regression analysis results have revealed that usage of biomass fuels for cooking has increased the concentrations of RSPM and CO indoors, considerably in winter. W/S ratios for RSPM have also been found to be higher than 1.0 at almost all the homes indicating that the concentration of RSPM is higher in winter season. Regression analysis results indicated that the major sources for RSPM and CO exist indoors and that is principally, cooking using the biomass as fuels and also cleaning of homes manually, particularly at commercial site (NZM site). The results of this study also suggest that the indoor RSPM concentrations are mainly composed of the finer range of particles.},

   abstract = {Human exposure to air pollution transported from the Midwest is evaluated in eight New York State (NYS) regions over ten summers (1997 – 2006) for association with respiratory–related hospital admissions. Days when pollution is transported into the Northeastern United States (U.S.) were identified by using back–trajectories from the eight regions. These back–trajectories help identify predominant meteorological patterns associated with “polluted” air parcels (originating in the Midwest where power plant emissions are known to be relatively high) and “clean” air parcels (originating from the North where pollution is known to be relatively low). Ambient ozone concentrations measurements were used to validate the classification of “polluted” and “clean” air parcels. These classifications were then used to define the days of high– versus low–exposure for populations residing within each region. The results of this analysis indicate that the risk of being hospitalized for respiratory–related illness in NYS is greater on those days when air is transported from the Midwest as compared to days when air is transported from the North. Using a refined method to examine air parcels moving through a boundary drawn around high–emitting power plants in the Midwestern U.S. resulted in stronger associations across more regions (significant odds ratios ranging from 1.06 to 1.16 for the entire study time period for six of the eight NYS regions). An assessment of temperature and its impact on the odds ratio calculation in the New York City metropolitan region indicates that temperature alone does not explain the increased association between air pollution and respiratory–related hospital admissions.},

   abstract = {Background
Asthma morbidity has been associated with ambient air pollutants in time-series and case-crossover studies. In such study designs, threshold effects of air pollutants on asthma outcomes have been relatively unexplored, which are of potential interest for exploring concentration–response relationships.
Methods
This study analyzes daily data on the asthma morbidity experienced by the pediatric Medicaid population (ages 2–18 years) of Detroit, Michigan and concentrations of pollutants fine particles (PM2.5), CO, NO2 and SO2 for the 2004–2006 period, using both time-series and case-crossover designs. We use a simple, testable and readily implementable profile likelihood-based approach to estimate threshold parameters in both designs.
Results
Evidence of significant increases in daily acute asthma events was found for SO2 and PM2.5, and a significant threshold effect was estimated for PM2.5 at 13 and 11μgm−3 using generalized additive models and conditional logistic regression models, respectively. Stronger effect sizes above the threshold were typically noted compared to standard linear relationship, e.g., in the time series analysis, an interquartile range increase (9.2μgm−3) in PM2.5 (5-day-moving average) had a risk ratio of 1.030 (95% CI: 1.001, 1.061) in the generalized additive models, and 1.066 (95% CI: 1.031, 1.102) in the threshold generalized additive models. The corresponding estimates for the case-crossover design were 1.039 (95% CI: 1.013, 1.066) in the conditional logistic regression, and 1.054 (95% CI: 1.023, 1.086) in the threshold conditional logistic regression.
Conclusion
This study indicates that the associations of SO2 and PM2.5 concentrations with asthma emergency department visits and hospitalizations, as well as the estimated PM2.5 threshold were fairly consistent across time-series and case-crossover analyses, and suggests that effect estimates based on linear models (without thresholds) may underestimate the true risk.},

We explored effect modification patterns by season, sex, age and by the presence of desert dust transported mainly from the Sahara area. We used daily time-series data provided by the children's hospitals and the fixed monitoring stations. The associations were investigated using Poisson regression models controlling for seasonality, weather, influenza episodes, day of the week and holiday effects. A 10μg/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with a 2.54% increase (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.06%, 5.08%) in the number of pediatric asthma hospital admissions, while the same increase in SO2 was associated with a 5.98% (95% CI: 0.88%, 11.33%) increase. O3 was associated with a statistically significant increase in asthma admissions among older children in the summer. Our findings provide limited evidence of an association between NO2 exposure and asthma exacerbation. Statistically significant PM10 effects were higher during winter and during desert dust days, while SO2 effects occurred mainly during spring. Our study confirms previously reported PM10 effects on emergency hospital admissions for pediatric asthma and further provides evidence of stronger effects during desert dust days. We additionally report severe effects of SO2, even at today's low concentration levels.},

Various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been related to respiratory health effects, but have generally been assessed individually without taking into account the fact that such pollutants are highly correlated to one other.
Aims
We investigated the effects of exposure to various VOC, and considered their combined effect on adult asthma and rhinitis.
Method
A national cross-sectional representative survey conducted by the Indoor Air Quality Observatory objectively assessed 20 VOCs in 490 main dwellings in France. A standardized questionnaire determined the prevalence of asthma and rhinitis among 1012 inhabitants of the dwellings (≥15 years). Marginal models for binary outcome were used to relate VOCs exposure to asthma and rhinitis, controlling for potential confounders. A global score representing the number of VOCs in each dwelling with an elevated concentration (using the 3rd quartile value of the distribution as a threshold value) was then derived as a measure of the combined effect of VOCs. Specific scores were built using a similar approach, grouping VOCs by family.
Results
Asthma (8.6%) was significantly associated with N-undecane and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and rhinitis (38.3%) with ethylbenzene, trichloroethylene, m/p- and o-xylene. The global VOC score was associated with a significant risk of asthma and rhinitis (odds ratio (OR) of 1.40 and 1.22, respectively, for 5 additional VOCs with high exposure level). Both specific scores for aromatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbons were associated with a significantly risk of asthma (OR=1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01–1.24 and OR=1.41; 95% CI=1.03–1.93, respectively). The specific VOC score for halogenated hydrocarbons was associated with a significant risk of rhinitis (OR=1.28; 95% CI: 1.07–1.54).
Conclusion
We have shown that high concentrations of VOCs in homes were associated with an increasing prevalence of asthma and rhinitis in adults.},

Air pollution has been associated with adverse cardiovascular effects.
Objective
To measure the association between air pollution, spirometry, blood pressure, and exercise capacity.
Methods
We used data from 5604 subjects collected during the Canada Health Measures Survey to test the association between air pollution measured on the day of the survey and spirometry (n=5011 subjects), blood pressure, and exercise capacity (n=3789 subjects).
Results
An interquartile range (IQR) increase in ozone (17.0ppb) was significantly associated with a 0.883% higher resting heart rate, a 0.718% higher systolic and 0.407% higher diastolic blood pressure, a 0.393% lower FEV1/FVC expressed as a percentage of predicted, and a 1.52% reduction in the aerobic fitness score (p<0.05). Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure were approximately 0.5mmHg higher for an (IQR 4.5μg/m3) increase in PM2.5 (IQR 4.5μg/m3) and 1mmHg higher for a 12.6ppb increase in NO2 (IQR 12.6ppb). An increase in PM2.5 was also associated with an approximate 0.4% decrease in percent predicted FEV1 and FVC (p<0.05).
Conclusion
Exposure to higher concentrations of air pollution was associated with higher resting blood pressure and lower ventilatory function. Ozone was associated with reduced exercise capacity.},

   abstract = {Summary
Background
Previously, we reported that prenatal exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and postnatal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in combination were associated with respiratory symptoms at ages 1 and 2 years. Here, we hypothesized that children exposed to both prenatal PAH and ETS may be at greater risk of asthma and seroatopy at ages 5–6 years, after controlling for current pollution exposure.
Methods
Prenatal PAH exposure was measured by personal air monitoring over 48 h. ETS exposure, respiratory symptoms and asthma at ages 5–6 years were assessed through questionnaire. Immunoglobulin (Ig) E was measured by Immunocap.
Results
A significant interaction between prenatal PAH and prenatal (but not postnatal) ETS exposure on asthma (p < 0.05), but not IgE, was detected. Among children exposed to prenatal ETS, a positive nonsignificant association was found between prenatal PAH exposure and asthma (OR 1.96, 95% CI [0.95–4.05]). Among children without exposure to prenatal ETS, a negative nonsignificant association was found between prenatal PAH exposure and asthma (OR 0.65, 95% CI [0.41–1.01]). Prenatal PAH exposure was not associated with asthma or IgE at age 5–6 years.
Conclusions
Combined prenatal exposure to PAH and ETS appears to be associated with asthma but not seroatopy at age 5–6. Exposure to PAH alone does not appear associated with either asthma or seroatopy at age 5–6 years. Discerning the differential effects between ETS exposed and ETS nonexposed children requires further study.},

The mean BC concentration at the site was 84 ng m−3 while monthly means varied from 25 to 144 ng m−3. Correcting for the impact of “mountain meteorology” yields an estimated surface equivalent annual mean concentration of 100 ng m−3. Periods of episodic high BC concentrations (>300 ng m−3), however, occurred throughout the year but were longer and more intense during the warmer months. We observed that the concentrations of O3, SO2, SO4, and PM2.5 mass, and to a lesser degree CO were often highly correlated with BC concentrations during the episodes, even when air trajectories indicated that the air masses reaching the site had passed through widely varied geographical regions. We report details of three specific BC episodes and examine the relationship between the co-measured species and air trajectories.},

   abstract = {This study examines the physicochemical and redox profiles of atmospheric semi-volatile compounds to evaluate their contribution to the oxidative potential of ambient particulate matter (PM). Concentrated ambient and thermodenuded quasi-ultrafine particles (<180 nm) were collected using the versatile aerosol concentration enrichment system (VACES) at an urban site near downtown Los Angeles. A thermodenuder (TD) was used to selectively remove the semi-volatile components of these aerosols over the temperature range of 50–200 °C. The oxidative potential of PM was measured by means of the DTT (dithiothreitol) assay. Detailed chemical analyses of PM samples, including organic and elemental carbon, water soluble elements, inorganic ions and PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), were conducted to quantify the volatility profiles of different PM species, and also to investigate their effect on measured oxidative potential. Refractory constituents, such as metals and elemental carbon, were marginally affected by heating, while labile species such as organic carbon and PAHs showed progressive loss in concentration with increase in TD temperature. The DTT-measured oxidative potential of PM was significantly decreased as the aerosols were heated and their semi-volatile components were progressively removed (42 ± 5%, 47 ± 8% and 66 ± 6% decrease at 50, 100 and 200 °C, respectively). Thus, semi-volatile compounds present in quasi-ultrafine urban aerosols constitute a significant fraction of PM oxidative potential, which is associated with the cellular generation of reactive oxygen species. Regression analysis performed between chemical constituents and DTT activity showed that the oxidative potential was strongly correlated with organic carbon and PAHs (R ≥ 0.80; p ≤ 0.05).},

NO concentrations decrease more rapidly than NO2 as NO is removed both by dilution and by chemical reaction with ozone. Whilst NO is the dominant form of NOx at the roadside, NO2 concentrations decay more slowly (due to chemical production and higher background levels) and NO2 typically forms the majority of NOx by 50–100 m from the source. For a majority of modelling studies the input NO and NO2 concentrations were set to match the experimental concentrations at the initial site. The measured decays of NO and NO2 can be accurately reproduced by the ADMS dispersion model only when chemical transformation is taken into account. When NOx is estimated directly from traffic flow measurements, the modelled NO2 tends to underestimate the measured value.},

This wood combustion can cause very high emissions of inhalable particles resulting in short and long-term health effects. The target of this study was to characterise particulate matter, emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their size distribution and to show that those emissions can be found in the ambient air of residential areas with wood-fired heating. Emission samples were collected from pellet stove and log wood boiler under different combustion conditions. Ambient PM10 sampling was performed during two winter seasons at two rural residential areas near Stuttgart in Germany. Samples were extracted using toluene with ultrasonic bath and analysed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Twenty-one PAH compounds including nine carcinogenic ones were detected and quantified. It was found that emission concentrations of carcinogenic PAHs were higher during incomplete combustion compared to complete combustion. Significant amounts of ambient PAHs were found in the residential villages, where the contribution of carcinogenic PAHs was 44% of total PAHs in the ambient air during winter 2009. The morphology and elemental analysis of ambient particles were also investigated. The findings indicate a rising concern to reduce emissions from wood-fired heating during winter in residential areas and underline the importance of using good wood combustion technologies to improve the air quality.},

Samples of nine typical building materials were tested individually and in combination, including carpet, ceiling material, gypsum board, linoleum, two paints, polyolefine, PVC and wood. Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions from each material were measured in a 50-liter small-scale chamber. Chamber air was sampled by PTR-MS to establish a database of emission signatures unique to each individual material. The same task was performed to measure combined emissions from material mixtures for the application and validation of the developed signal separation method. Results showed that the proposed method could identify the individual sources under laboratory conditions with two, three, five and seven materials present. Further experiments and investigation are needed for cases where the relative emission rates among different compounds may change over a long-term period.},

The positive matrix factorization (PMF) method was applied in source apportionment for daily PAH data combined with other pollutant data. A three-factor solution of the PMF analysis with 28 components was chosen. These three factors were identified as long-range transported secondary particles (F1), combustion (F2) and a sea-salt factor (F3). The conditional probability function (CPF) was used to combine wind direction sectors with the PMF factors. In cases F1 and F2, pollutants mainly originated from the south-east, whereas pollutants in F3 came from the south-western sector. PAHs entered into the combustion factor 2 together with SO2, NOx, black carbon and potassium. This suggests that the PAHs at Virolahti originated from traffic and industrial pollution, as well as biomass burning. Elevated concentrations occurred throughout the winter period and most frequently originated from the south-eastern sector between 90°–135°. This sector includes, among other transboundary areas, the metropolis of St. Petersburg at a distance of 160 km.},

   abstract = {The purpose of the study is to identify long-range transport patterns that may have an important influence on PM10 levels in three European cities at different latitudes, namely Thessaloniki, Szeged and Helsinki. A further aim is to separate medium- and long-range PM10 transport for these cities. 4-day, 6-hourly three-dimensional (3D) backward trajectories arriving at these locations at 1200 GMT were computed using the HYSPLIT model over a 5-year period from 2001 to 2005. A k-means clustering algorithm using the Mahalanobis metric was applied in order to develop trajectory types. The 3D delimination of the clusters by the function “convhull” is a novel approach. Two statistical indices were used to evaluate and compare critical daily PM10 exceedances corresponding to the trajectory clusters. For Thessaloniki, the major PM10 transport can be clearly associated with air masses arriving from Central and Southern Europe. Occasional North African dust intrusions over Greece are also found. The transport of particulate matter from North-western Europe to Thessaloniki is of limited importance. For Szeged, Central Europe, Southern Europe and Mid-eastern Europe are the most important sources of PM10. The occasional appearance of North African-origin dust over Hungary is also detected. Local PM10 levels tend to be diluted when air masses arrive at the Carpathian Basin from North-western Europe, the Mid-Atlantic – Western Europe and Northern Europe. For Helsinki, high PM10 concentrations are due to air masses coming from Northern and Eastern Europe including North-western Russia. An occasional Caspian Sea desert influence on particulate levels can also be identified. However, air currents coming from the Northern Atlantics, Northern and North-western Europe tend to dilute PM10 levels. A simple approach is developed in order to separate medium- and long-range PM10 transport for each city.},

   abstract = {As part of the MIRAGE (MILAGRO) study conducted 7–30 March 2006 in Mexico City and its Metropolitan Area (MCMA), fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was collected using two Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM) systems, and a Partisol instrument at the T1 super-site (Tecamac, State of Mexico). Inorganic analysis was performed on filter-based (PM1, PM2.5-URG) measurements also collected at this site. Measurements from the gravimetric (TEOMs, Partisol) and URG systems were inter-compared with chemical speciation measurements using a Particle Into Liquid Sampler (PILS) and Thermal Optical methods. Mass and chemical balances applied over the first part of the study (11–22 March) showed that a TEOM using a device (SES) which reduces particle-bound water and retains a fraction of semi-volatile compounds (SVM) gives readings ∼30% larger than a conventional TEOM. In the second part of the study (26–30 March), the loss of SVM during TEOM-heated filter collection (both systems) represented a significant fraction of PM2.5 mass due to changes in particle composition. Overall, when nonvolatile nitrate dominated (i.e., when associated with crustal species and not NH4+) and/or sulfate dominates (SO42−/NO3− molar ratio is >1), PM2.5 mass readings are in agreement with those reported for the T1 site if TEOM is using a SES device. However, when volatile nitrate dominates (i.e., NH4NO3) or SO42−/NO3− molar ratio is <1, a larger fraction is lost from both TEOMs (with or without the SES device). Under the latter regime, uncertainties are large and gravimetric losses may reach 30%–50%. The gravimetric PARTISOL instrument recorded lower readings under all of the aforementioned conditions with differences versus TEOMs decreasing with increasing RH. These findings call for a careful characterization of such volatilization biases to improve current PM (PM10, PM2.5) measurements/networks, especially in alkaline-rich environments that can favor such biases. With regards to PM1 and PM2.5 filter-based measurements, findings are: 1) crustal-related elements are important features in the PM2.5–1 size fraction; 2) a factor of ∼2 overestimation of SO42− concentrations is recorded on substrates during PM collection and 3) main elements of a typical urban aerosol size distribution are concentrated in the 1μm (versus 2.5μm) size fraction.},

The annual mean concentrations for PM10 and PM2.5 were 138.5 ± 40.4 μg m−3 and 50.6 ± 20.4 μg m−3, respectively, with higher concentrations during winter than summer period. Concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 have been found that were higher than the prescribed limits of the WHO and the NAAQS given by CPCB, India. The trace metals detected in the PM10 and PM2.5 were Al, Ca, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, V and Zn and their concentrations were similar to those observed in heavily polluted urban areas from local traffic and other anthropogenic emissions. Total PAH concentrations for PM10 and PM2.5 were much higher in winter (81.5 and 96 ng m−3, respectively) compared to summer (33.1 and 45.8 ng m−3, respectively) with high molecular weight homologues (4–6 ring PAHs), which account for 80–95.8% of total PAHs. In general, the PM2.5 PAH concentrations were higher than PM10 particles. The results of diagnostic ratio and enrichment factor analyses showed that vehicular and anthropogenic emissions related to combustion, industrial processes as well as natural sources associated with the transport of dust from the roadside area were the main pollutant sources for PAHs and trace metals.},

Metals concentrations in different fractions and locations were studied. Metals sources were identified by cluster and primary component analysis. The potential risk to human health was assessed by human exposure model. Results showed that Zn, Mn, Pb and Cu were higher in all the three fractions. V, Cr, Mn and Co ranged close to the background values of Chinese soil indicating that they were mainly from crustal materials. Concentrations of Zn, Mn, Pb, V, Cr, Ni, Co and Cd were higher in old district than that in new district for the three fractions. The PM2.5/PM10, PM10/PM100 and PM2.5/PM100 ratios were higher for Zn, Cd, Cu, Pb, Ni, As and Cr (all higher than 1.0), and lower for Co, Mn and V (all less than or close to 1.0) which meant that anthropologic sources associated metals were more easily accumulated in finer particles than metals from crustal materials. Spatial variations indicated that the ten metals peaked at surroundings near railway station, gas stations, industrial boilers and machine manufacturing plant implying the influence of local vehicle emission, fossil fuel combustion and industrial activities as well as crustal materials which was verified by cluster analysis and primary component analysis results. Ingestion of dust particles appeared to be the main route of exposure to re-suspended dust. Hazard Indexes of As were both highest for children and adult which could be a potential threat to human health for non-cancer effect and it also exhibited the highest values for cancer effect as 1.01E-06, 7.04E-07 and 7.21E-07 for PM2.5, PM10 and PM100, respectively.},

   abstract = {Despite their importance, current scientific knowledge on non-exhaust emissions by road traffic is scarce, severely hampering a reliable description of these particles in atmospheric dispersion models. Consequently, it is still very difficult to convincingly evaluate population exposure to traffic-related components in large cities, especially given the significant variation in traffic-related air pollution concentrations on a small scale (e.g. within 100–1000 m of a busy road). One factor contributing to this uncertainty is the lack of a reliable emission estimate for vehicular non-exhaust emissions. Emissions vary from location to location due to the impact of climate, road surface characteristics and traffic conditions, but the geographical coverage for which Emission Factors are available and the amount of knowledge regarding the variability within a city environment are very limited. The present study investigates the spatial and chemical properties of the strength of the emission source (road dust particles below 10 μm) in three contrasting European urban environments: two Spanish cities (Barcelona and Girona), and a Swiss city (Zürich). Loadings of road dust <10 μm from the 8 sites sampled in Zürich ranged from 0.2 to 1.3 mg m−2, the lowest loadings of the study. The minimum loadings in Girona (Spain) were as high as the maximum in Zürich, with a range of 1.3–7.1 mg m−2. By far the most polluted site in terms of road dust <10 μm mass loading is Barcelona (Spain), where a range of 3.7–23.1 mg m−2 was recorded in the city center samples. Four main sources were found to drive the variability of road dust particles <10 μm: Mineral (road wear and urban dust generated mostly by construction emissions), Motor Exhaust, Brake wear and Tire wear. Road wear/Mineral is the dominating source in Spanish cities (∼60%), but represents only 30% of road dust loadings in Zürich where contributions are more equally distributed among the four main sources of road dust. Regardless of the city categories loadings of OC, EC, Fe, Cr, Mn, Cu, Zn, Mo, Sn, Sb, Cs, Ba, W, Pb and Bi (μg m−2) increase by a factor of 1.2–2.2, from streets with <15 kveh to streets with 15–40 kveh day−1. At highly trafficked sites (>40 kveh day−1) loadings were again increasing by a further factor of 2.6–10.1. Finally, agreement was found between the composition of sampled materials and the composition (available from literature) of PM10 material emitted by vehicles via resuspension (both in Zürich and Barcelona). This permitted to find a relationship, potentially able to calculate emission factors from known amount of deposited pollutants in those cities/environment where no real-world EFs are available from literature.},

We developed a numerical methodology based on Monte Carlo method, in order to estimate the best combination from a probabilistic point of view. More than 106 different cases were analyzed according to a purpose built sub-routine and our results showed that the daily alveolar particle number and surface area deposited for all of the age groups considered was equal to 1.5 × 1011 particles and 2.5 × 1015 μm2, respectively, varying slightly for males and females living in Northern or Southern Italy. In terms of tracheobronchial deposition, the corresponding values for daily particle number and surface area for all age groups was equal to 6.5 × 1010 particles and 9.9 × 1014 μm2, respectively. Overall, the highest contributions were found to come from indoor cooking (female), working time (male) and transportation (i.e. traffic derived particles) (children).},

   abstract = {This paper examines the contribution of primary and secondary NO2 production in NOx concentrations and offers a comprehensive analysis of the long-term trends of NOx, NO2 and O3 concentrations, as well as of the NO2/NOx ratio, in the Athens urban conurbation. Long-term pollutant concentration time series show that NO2 concentrations in Athens have decreased since 1987 but at a slower rate than those of NOx, resulting to an increasing NO2/NOx concentration ratio. However, this increasing trend is much smaller than those observed in urban areas of other European countries. The possible causes of this trend are examined and especially the interaction with ozone and the amount of direct NO2 traffic emissions. The results indicate that the increasing NO2/NOx ratio in the Athens area is mainly attributable to an increased secondary formation of NO2 through photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. More specifically, two different empirical methodologies were applied to examine the primary NO2 concentration fraction in Athens, using ambient monitoring data from a kerbside station. Both methods indicate that the primary NO2 concentration share has not altered significantly between 1998 and 2006. This is mainly attributed to the fact that in the Athens area diesel passenger cars are not allowed and after-treatment technologies such as particle filters and oxidation catalysts are not yet applied in Greece. A probable future penetration of diesel passenger cars in Athens should be combined with inventories of primary NO2 emissions and with the development of appropriate policies to reduce ambient NO2 concentrations below the EU limit values.},

We used portable aethalometers to measure black carbon levels with a high temporal resolution and a PDA with GPS-logger and electronic diary. The exposure to black carbon differs between partners by up to 30%, although they live at the same location. The activity contributing most to this difference is transport: Average exposure in transport is 6445 ng m−3, followed by exposure during shopping (2584 ng m−3). Average exposure is lowest while sleeping (1153 ng m−3) and when doing home-based activities (1223 ng m−3). Full-time workers spend almost twice as much time in transport as the homemakers. As a result of the study design we measured in several different homes, shops, cars, etc. enabling a better insight in true overall exposure in those microenvironments.

Local meteorological conditions are among those factors which governed the largest day-to-day variations of PM10 concentration in the Klang Valley areas during the dry season. When augmented by synoptic meteorological variables and foreign emission sources, a remarkable increase in the explained variance was apparent. On the other hand, domestic burning sources only had a minimal impact on PM10 fluctuations. Important synoptic weather patterns which influence the air pollution variations were also identified. These synoptic conditions include the strengthening of the summer monsoon southwesterly winds over the equatorial area. In addition, the formation of cyclonic circulation, associated with typhoon formation over the north-west Pacific and the South China Sea as well as over the Bay of Bengal, are found to have had a profound impact on PM10 variations over the Malaysian region through the modulation of regional moisture distributions.},

   abstract = {A case study designed to investigate indoor and outdoor air quality in naturally ventilated homes near the US-Mexico border was conducted in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico from 14–30 March 2009. To better understand resident’s actual exposure to various sizes of particulate matter (PM), we compare measured concentrations in homes using different household stove cooking fuels (gas versus biomass) and investigate the spatial distribution of outdoor PM. Data from two home locations, one with a gas stove and one with both biomass and gas stoves are evaluated. In each home, continuous PM concentrations were sampled over a range of particle sizes. Indoor and outdoor concentration measurements were facilitated using a valve switching system. PM2.5 was also sampled on quartz filters located inside and outside of the two homes for carbon analysis. This paper will present a subset of the field data to compare time resolved indoor PM concentrations and carbon content for the two homes; specifically, comparing cooking versus non-cooking time periods. Results indicate that indoor elemental carbon concentrations are dominated by indoor sources during biomass burning, and outdoor sources at all other times. The data indicate that the influence of indoor sources on organic carbon concentrations increases during both gas and biomass stove use; this information is correlated to continuous indoor PM concentrations and home activities. The mean 24 h indoor PM10 concentration was 408 μg m−3 for the gas stove home and 648 μg m−3 for the home with biomass and gas stoves, while the outdoor concentrations were 609 μg m−3 and 381 μg m−3, respectively. The average 24 h PM10 Indoor/Outdoor ratio was 0.71 for the gas stove home and 1.79 for the home with both gas and biomass stoves. These ratios should be interpreted with caution as they appear to underestimate the indoor source contribution due to high outdoor PM levels.},

   abstract = {We estimate fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations daily using MODIS satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) for a major biomass burning event around Moscow during summer 2010. Evaluation of MODIS AOD with the Moscow AERONET site supports a MODIS-AOD error estimate of ±(0.05+0.2×AOD) for this event. However, since the smoke was often thick (AOD>4.0) and spatially variable, the standard MODIS algorithm incorrectly identifies some aerosol as cloud. We test relaxed cloud screening criteria that increase MODIS coverage by 21% and find excellent agreement with coincident operational retrievals (r2=0.994, slope=1.01) with no evidence of false aerosol detection. We relate the resultant MODIS AOD to PM2.5 using aerosol vertical profiles from the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. Our estimates are in good agreement with PM2.5 values estimated from in-situ PM10 (r2=0.85, slope=1.06), and we find that the relationship between AOD and PM2.5 is insensitive to uncertainties in biomass burning emissions. The satellite-derived and in-situ values both indicate that peak daily mean concentrations of approximately 600μgm−3 occurred on August 7, 2010 in the Moscow region of the Russian Federation. We estimate that exposure to air pollution from the Moscow wildfires may have caused hundreds of excess deaths.},

   abstract = {To better understand secondary aerosol pollution and potential source regions, semi-continuous measurement of water-soluble ions in PM2.5 was performed from December 2007 to October 2008 in Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province. The data was analyzed with the aid of backward trajectory cluster analysis in conjunction with redistributed concentration field (RCF) model and principal component analysis (PCA). SO42−, NO3− and NH4+ were the most abundant ionic species with annual mean concentrations (±standard deviations) of 38.33 (±26.20), 15.77 (±12.06) and 21.26 (±16.28) μg m−3, respectively, which are among the highest levels reported in the literatures in the world. Well-defined seasonal and diurnal patterns of SO42−, NO3− and NH4+ were observed. The fine sulfate and nitrate oxidation ratios (SOR and NOR) were much higher in summer (SOR: 0.47 ± 0.13; NOR: 0.28 ± 0.03) than those in other seasons (SOR: 0.17–0.30; NOR: 0.12–0.14), indicating more extensive formations of SO42− and NO3− in summer. The most frequent air masses connected with high concentrations of SO42−, NO3− and NH4+ originated from Shandong Province in spring, autumn and winter, while from the Yellow Sea in summer, and then slowly traveled in Shandong Province to Jinan. RCF model indicated that Shandong Province was the main potential source region for SO42− and NO3− and other potential source regions were also identified including the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Anhui and Jiangsu and the Yellow Sea. Principal component analysis indicated that the major sources contributing to PM2.5 pollution were secondary aerosols, coal/biomass burnings and traffic emissions.},

Additionally, particulate matter smaller than 2.5μm (PM2.5) was included in the study (February 2005–September 2007, n=32). A chemical sequential extraction scheme according to Fernández Espinosa et al. (2002) was applied to assess the speciation and potential mobility of the elements. Four different fractions were distinguished, which can be classified as: (f1) water-extractable, (f2) bound to carbonates, oxides and reducible metals, (f3) bound to organic matter, oxidisable and sulfidic metals, and (f4) residual fraction. The chemical speciation results illustrated that potential toxic metals like Zn (41%), Cd (40%), Mn (32%), and As (29%) were detectable to a high percentage in the water-soluble fraction (f1) of TSP samples and consequently are especially harmful to the environment and exposed people. Lead and Cu in TSP samples showed highest extractability in fraction f2 (53% and 23%, respectively) and can also be considered as mobile with a negative impact on the environment and the human health. Fine particles (PM2.5) showed comparable results with sometimes higher percentages in the highly mobile fraction f1, for example for As (52%). Anthropogenic sources, such as industry and traffic, played an important role for overall atmospheric pollution throughout the year. Additionally, these more or less constant emissions were superimposed by seasonal sources, especially coal combustion in winter and geogenic dust in spring. Coal combustion proved to be a source especially relevant for the toxic and mobile elements Cd, As and Pb. The study illustrated that special attention has to be taken to the mentioned elements and their related sources for health impact assessments and when planning mitigation measures for urban atmospheric pollution and for providing a sustainable development of cities and megacities.},

The samples were analyzed for mass, black carbon (BC), and elemental compositions. The resulting data set were analyzed for sources by Positive Matrix Factorization (EPA-PMF). From previous studies, it is found that, the air quality became worse in the dry winter period compared to the rainy season because of higher particulate matter concentration in the ambient air. Therefore, seasonal source contributions were determined from seasonally segregated data using EPA-PMF modeling so that further policy interventions can be undertaken to improve air quality. From the source apportionment results, it is observed that vehicular emissions and emission from brick kiln are the major contributors to air pollution in Dhaka especially in the dry seasons, while contribution from emissions from metal smelters increases during rainy seasons. The Government of Bangladesh is considering different interventions to reduce the emissions from those sources by adopting conversion of diesel/petrol vehicles to CNG, increasing traffic speed in the city and by introducing green technologies for brick production. However, in order to reduce the transboundary effect it is necessary to take action regionally.},

   abstract = {The recent rapid expansion of PM2.5 monitoring alongside PM10 has allowed estimation of concentrations of coarse particles (PM2.5–10) by difference. This has been carried out for sites using comparable measurement techniques for both metrics, and the properties of the hourly average concentration data have been evaluated. In the UK atmosphere, coarse particles generally represent well under half of PM10 mass. The ratio of PMcoarse to PM10 averages 0.29 ± 0.14 (n = 43) for FDMS measurements and 0.38 ± 0.30 (n = 12) for TEOM measurements and does not show a very consistent pattern according to site type. The values are mostly higher for TEOM measurements than for FDMS which is explicable in terms of semi-volatile losses predominantly from fine particles in the TEOM. Sites where PMcoarse/PM10 exceeds 0.5 generally have a marine or industrial influence. Correlations between hourly PM2.5 and PM10 are generally very high (mean R = 0.80 for FDMS data and mean R = 0.85 for TEOM data) whilst those between PMcoarse and PM2.5 are very much lower (mean R = 0.09 for FDMS measurements and mean R = 0.41 for TEOM measurement sites). When inter-site correlations are examined between sites of similar characteristics within 30 km of one another, the inter-site correlation of PM2.5 (R = 0.56–0.87) is very much higher than that of PMcoarse (R = 0.25–0.60). Coefficients of Divergence indicate lower spatial homogeneity for PMcoarse than for PM2.5. When hourly data are used to construct pollution roses, it is typical for PM2.5 and PM10 to show a similar pattern dominated either by long-range transport or local traffic sources while PMcoarse can show quite a different pattern indicative of a different range of contributory sources. Plots of particle concentration versus wind speed show a monotonic decline of concentration with increasing wind speed for PM2.5, but an initial decline and an increase at higher wind speeds for PMcoarse. There are relatively few datasets allowing an examination of temporal trend but those available for 4.5–10 years generally show no significant trend with time for fine or coarse particles, or for PM10. Weekday/weekend and diurnal concentration patterns for coarse and fine particles show a strong anthropogenic influence on PMcoarse and a larger weekday/weekend difference for PMcoarse than PM2.5. It is concluded that coarse and fine particles show very different behaviour as a result of their different sources and properties. The lower spatial homogeneity of coarse particles may be a contributory factor in why they appear to be less toxic than fine particles in epidemiological studies.},

Since children spend on average 7–11 h per weekday at school, the IAQ in classrooms is expected to play a key role in the assessment of the effects of their personal exposure to air pollution. Within this context the present study was conducted in order to fulfill three primary objectives 1) to measure the levels and the element composition of PM2.5 and PM2.5–10, in three primary schools placed in Lisbon, in order to assess the children exposure to these pollutants; 2) to study the relationship between indoor and outdoor atmospheric particles concentrations and 3) to investigate the sources of high aerosols concentrations in classrooms. In the studied classrooms, the concentrations of coarse particles significantly exceeded the ambient levels. Element concentrations suggested that the physical activity of students highly contributed to the re-suspension of sedimented particles. The high levels of CO2 indicated that in these schools the ventilation was inadequate. This fact contributed to the establishment of poor IAQ.},

Elemental composition was different in the two fractions: in the finer one the presence of elements with crustal origin is reduced, while the anthropogenic elements, with a relevant environmental and health impact, appear to be increased. An important but unmeasured component is likely constituted by organic and elemental carbon compounds. Multivariate analysis (Positive Matrix Factorization) of the SR-XRF data resolved a number of components (factors) which, on the basis of their chemical compositions, were assigned physical meanings.},

Present study, therefore, aimed at developing a novel, fuzzy-based air quality index (FAQI11Fuzzy-based air quality index (FAQI).) to handle such limitations. The index developed by present study is based on fuzzy logic that is considered as one of the most common computational methods of artificial intelligence. In addition to criteria air pollutants (i.e. CO, SO2, PM10, O3, NO2), benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and 1,3-butadiene were also taken into account in the index proposed, because of their considerable health effects. Different weighting factors were then assigned to each pollutant according to its priority. Trapezoidal membership functions were employed for classifications and the final index consisted of 72 inference rules. To assess the performance of the index, a case study was carried out employing air quality data at five different sampling stations in Tehran, Iran, from January 2008 to December 2009, results of which were then compared to the results obtained from USEPA air quality index (AQI). According to the results from present study, fuzzy-based air quality index is a comprehensive tool for classification of air quality and tends to produce accurate results. Therefore, it can be considered useful, reliable, and suitable for consideration by local authorities in air quality assessment and management schemes.},

Air pollution data, collected at 113 sites (spread across Delhi and its neighboring areas) from July–December 2003, were used to compute exposure at the place of residence of 3989 subjects. A socio-economic and respiratory health survey was administered in 1576 households. This survey collected time-use, residence histories, demographic information, and direct measurements of lung function with subjects. The optimal interpolation methods were used to link air pollution and respiratory health data at the place of their residence. Resident histories, in combination with secondary data, were used to impute cumulative exposure prior to the air-quality interventions, and the effects of recent air quality measures on lung function were then evaluated. Three important findings emerge from the analysis. First, the interventions were associated with a significant improvement in respiratory health. Second, the effect of these interventions varied significantly by gender and income. Third, consistent with a causal interpretation of these results, effects were the strongest among those individuals who spend a disproportionate share of their time out-of-doors.},

   abstract = {Traffic restrictions are an unpopular tool to mitigate urban air pollution, and a measurable improvement in air quality is needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this measure. Previous attempts failed to detect measurable reductions of PM mass pollution within the areas subject to traffic restriction. However black carbon, which is emitted primarily by traffic sources, could be a PM metric more suitable than PM mass to demonstrate pollutant reductions. In this study we report the results of a black carbon monitoring campaign carried out in Milan, Italy, with the aim to detect - and demonstrate more suitably than PM mass - differences in local urban air quality among three zones located very closely with different traffic intensity. The study was carried out in three different days by measuring simultaneously black carbon and PM mass concentrations with fixed monitoring stations located in three main radial roads connecting the outskirts to the city center, each with three segments: 1) an outer one, with no traffic restrictions 2) an intermediate one, subject to the congestion traffic charge called “Ecopass”, where a ticket is required to enter for cars equipped with engines prior to Euro 4 standard; 3) the pedestrian zone (no cars admitted) of Duomo Square in the city center, where each of the three main roads ends. The results demonstrated a sharply declining gradient in black carbon levels from the outer zone, without traffic restrictions, to the more central areas, for all of the three radial main roads. The differences in mean black carbon levels in the same day in the different traffic scheme locations were highly significant for each comparison. In contrast to the Black carbon results, mean PM10, PM2.5, PM1 concentrations did not show significant differences among the different traffic zones on the different campaign days. The ratio of black carbon to PM10 decreased by 47% and 62% in the Ecopass zone and in the pedestrian zone, respectively, as compared to the no-restriction zone. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study showing that within-city proximal areas with different traffic intensity are associated with different black carbon levels. These data suggest that black carbon is a highly relevant metric of traffic pollution and should be taken into consideration in demonstrating the effectiveness of air quality mitigation measures.},

   abstract = {Particulate pollution is an environmental concern that is widespread and difficult to resolve. Recently various regulatory improvements around the world have been agreed upon to tackle this problem, especially as related to the fine fraction of particulates, which more closely correlates to human health effects than other fractions. The size-fractionation of inhalable particles and their organic composition represent a new area of research that has been poorly explored thus far. Endotoxins are a type of natural organic compound that can be found in particulate matter. They are correlated with Gram-negative bacterial contamination. Health outcomes associated with exposure to these toxins are not specific and often overlap with the health effects of PM (Particulate Matter) exposure, including asthma, bronchitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and organic dust toxic syndrome. Very little information is available on the endotoxin distribution in different PM10 size fractions. This study examined PM10 size fractions and their endotoxin content. Sampling was conducted at five different locations: one urban, two rural and two rural sites that were highly influenced by large-scale farm animal production facilities. For each location, six different PM10 fractions were evaluated. PM10 sub-fractions were categorised as follows: PM10–7.2 (1.15–31.30 μg m−3); PM7.2–3.0 (1.86–30.73 μg m−3); PM3.0–1.5 (1.74–13.90 μg m−3); PM1.5–0.95 (0.24–10.57 μg m−3); PM0.95–0.49 (1.22–14.33 μg m−3) and PM<0.49 (13.15–85.49 μg m−3). The ranges of endotoxin levels determined were: PM10–7.2 (0.051–5.401 endotoxin units (EU) m−3); PM7.2–3.0 (0.123–7.801 EU m−3); PM3.0–1.5 (0.057–1.635 EU m−3); PM1.5–0.95 (0.040–2.477 EU m−3); PM0.95–0.49 (0.007–3.159 EU m−3) and PM<0.49 (0.039–3.975 EU m−3). Our results indicated consistency of the PM1 fraction at all of the sites and the predominant presence of endotoxins in the coarse fraction. The observed abatement of the PM10 and endotoxin levels was very high (above 1:10) as little as 50 m from the pollution source. This kind of model is useful to both improve our knowledge about PM10 endotoxin distribution and to evaluate the potential risks for the health of neighbouring populations.},

   abstract = {Air pollution exposure during pregnancy has been linked to a wide range of negative health effects. NO2, a traffic pollution marker, and benzene, an industrial pollution indicator, stand out among the types of air pollution linked to these effects. The aim of this work is to show the methodology used to assign exposure levels for both pollutants and preliminary reports in the INMA (Environment and Childhood) Asturias cohort in Spain. This cohort consists of 494 pregnant women and their children, who have been recruited and followed since 2004. Air pollution levels were measured at 67 points by means of passive samplers. The mean NO2 measured value was 21.2 μg m−3 (range 3.5 μg m−3 to 44.5 μg m−3), and the mean benzene value was 2.72 μg m−3 (range 0.18 μg m−3 to 9.17 μg m−3) at urban sampling points and 0.64 μg m−3 (range 0.04 μg m−3 to 2.62 μg m−3) in rural locations. The Pearson correlation coefficient among pollutants was 0.42. Land Use Regression models were built to predict exposure at the homes of pregnant women. Altitude, road distances and land use were part of the models. The percent of explained variance was 52% for NO2 and 73% for benzene in the urban zones. No residual autocorrelation was found. Predictions were corrected based on the Air Quality Network of the Principality of Asturias taking into account pregnancy seasonality. Exposure indicators were determined for each term and for the entire pregnancy for each woman. Values for urban locations were higher than those for rural and benzene estimations for 5% of the cohort women were above the European Union annual limit value. Air pollution exposure for the INMA-Asturias cohort clearly depends on the place of residence. In particular, benzene concentrations are remarkably high if an individual lives in an urban and industrial area, which is an issue of management intervention and regulatory concern. Exposure assessment for different pollutants will allow us to evaluate potential adverse effects in foetal and infant health caused by air pollution.},

To study the pollution of atmospheric particles at winter in Beijing and compare the lung toxicity which induced by particle samples from different sampling sites.
Method
We collected samples from two sampling points during the winter for toxicity testing and chemical analysis. Wistar rats were administered with particles by intratracheal instillation. After exposure, biochemically index, esimmunity indexes, histopathology and DNA damage were detected in rat pulmonary cells.
Result
The elements with enrichment factors (EF) larger than 10 were As, Cd, Cu, Zn, S and Pb in the four experiment groups. The priority control of the total concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in PM10 and PM2.5 of Near-traffic source was much higher than that of Far-traffic source, it demonstrated that near the traffic source of PAHs pollution was heavier than that of Far-traffic source, as it was close to main roads Beiyuan Road, motor vehicle emissions were much higher. The pathology of lung showed that the degree of inflammation was increased with the particle diameter minished, it was the same as the detection of biochemical parameters such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Total antioxidant status(T-AOC) and total protein (TP) in BALF and inflammation cytokine(interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) in lung homogenate. The indexes of DNA damage including the content of DNA and Olive empennage of PM2.5 were significant higher than that of PM10 at the same surveillance point (P < 0.05), near-traffic particles were higher than the far-traffic particles at the same diameter, (P < 0.05).
Conclusion
Near-traffic area particles had certain pollution at winter in Beijing. Meanwhile, atmospheric particulate matters on lung toxicity were related to the particles size and distance related sites which were exposed: smaller size, more toxicity; nearer from traffic, more toxicity.},

   abstract = {Particulate matter, especially PM2.5, is associated with increased morbidity and mortality from respiratory diseases. Studies that focus on the chemical composition of the material are frequent in the literature, but those that characterize the biological fraction are rare. The objectives of this study were to characterize samples collected in Sao Paulo, Brazil on the quantity of fungi and endotoxins associated with PM2.5, correlating with the mass of particulate matter, chemical composition and meteorological parameters. We did that by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and multiple linear regressions. The results have shown that fungi and endotoxins represent significant portion of PM2.5, reaching average concentrations of 772.23sporesμg−1 of PM2.5 (SD: 400.37) and 5.52EUmg−1 of PM2.5 (SD: 4.51EUmg−1), respectively. Hyaline basidiospores, Cladosporium and total spore counts were correlated to factor Ba/Ca/Fe/Zn/K/Si of PM2.5 (p < 0.05). Genera Pen/Asp were correlated to the total mass of PM2.5 (p < 0.05) and colorless ascospores were correlated to humidity (p < 0.05). Endotoxin was positively correlated with the atmospheric temperature (p < 0.05). This study has shown that bioaerosol is present in considerable amounts in PM2.5 in the atmosphere of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Some fungi were correlated with soil particle resuspension and mass of particulate matter. Therefore, the relative contribution of bioaerosol in PM2.5 should be considered in future studies aimed at evaluating the clinical impact of exposure to air pollution.},

This paper aims at developing and presenting a reliable approach, in order to forecast C6H6 levels in urban environments, demonstrated for Thessaloniki, Greece. Multiple stepwise regression analysis is used and a strong statistical relationship is detected between C6H6 and CO. The adopted regression model is validated in order to depict its applicability and representativeness. The presented results demonstrate that the adopted approach is capable of capturing C6H6 concentration trends and should be considered as complementary to air quality monitoring.},

   abstract = {Managing urban air pollution necessitates a feasible and efficient abatement strategy which is characterised as a defined set of specific control measures. In practice, hard budget constraints are present in any decision-making process and therefore available alternatives need to be hierarchised in a fast but still reliable manner. Moreover, realistic strategies require adequate information on the available control measures, taking also into account the area’s special characteristics. The selection of the most applicable bundle of measures rests in achieving stakeholders’ consensus, while taking into consideration mutually conflicting views and criteria. A preliminary qualitative comparison of alternative control measures would be most handy for decision-makers, forming the grounds for an in-depth analysis of the most promising ones. This paper presents an easy-to-follow multicriteria methodological approach in order to include and synthesise multi-disciplinary knowledge from various stakeholders so as to result into a priority list of abatement options, achieve consensus and secure the adoption of the resulting optimal solution. The approach relies on the active involvement of public authorities and local stakeholders in order to incorporate their environmental, economic and social preferences. The methodological scheme is implemented for the case of Thessaloniki, Greece, an area considered among the most polluted cities within Europe, especially with respect to airborne particles. Intense police control, natural gas penetration in buildings and metro construction equally result into the most “promising” alternatives in order to control air pollution in the GTA. The three optimal alternatives belong to different thematic areas, namely road transport, thermal heating and infrastructure. Thus, it is obvious that efforts should spread throughout all thematic areas. Natural gas penetration in industrial units, intense monitoring of environmental standards and regular maintenance of heavy oil burners are ranked as 4th, 5th and 6th optimal alternatives, respectively.},

   abstract = {The aim of the study is to analyse the joint effect of biological (pollen) and chemical air pollutants, as well as meteorological variables, on the hospital admissions of respiratory problems for the Szeged region in Southern Hungary. The data set used covers a nine-year period (1999–2007) and is unique in the sense that it includes—besides the daily number of respiratory hospital admissions—not just the hourly mean concentrations of CO, PM10, NO, NO2, O3 and SO2 with meteorological variables (temperature, global solar flux, relative humidity, air pressure and wind speed), but two pollen variables (Ambrosia and total pollen excluding Ambrosia) as well. The analysis was performed using three age categories for the pollen season of Ambrosia and the pollen-free season. Meteorological elements and air pollutants are clustered in order to define optimum environmental conditions of high patient numbers. ANOVA was then used to determine whether cluster-related mean patient numbers differ significantly. Furthermore, two novel procedures are applied here: factor analysis including a special transformation and a time-varying multivariate linear regression that makes it possible to determine the rank of importance of the influencing variables in respiratory hospital admissions, and also compute the relative importance of the parameters affecting respiratory disorders. Both techniques revealed that Ambrosia pollen is an important variable that influences hospital admissions (an increase of 10 pollen grains m−3 can imply an increase of around 24% in patient numbers). The role of chemical and meteorological parameters is also significant, but their weights vary according to the seasons and the methods. Clearer results are obtained for the pollination season of Ambrosia. Here, a 10 μg m−3 increase in O3 implies a patient number response from −17% to +11%. Wind speed is a surprisingly important variable, where a 1 m s−1 rise may result in a hospital admission reduction of up to 42–45%.},

   abstract = {Policies to reduce outdoor air pollution concentrations are often assessed on the basis of the regulated pollutants. Whether these are the most appropriate components to assess the potential health benefits is questionable, as other health-relevant pollutants may be more strongly related to traffic. The aim of this study is to compare the contrast in concentration between major roads and (sub)urban background for a large range of pollutants and to analyze the magnitude of the measured difference in the street – background for major streets with different street configurations. Measurements of PM10, PM2.5, particle number concentrations (PNC), black carbon (BC), elemental composition of PM10 and PM2.5 and NOx were conducted simultaneously in eight major streets and nine (sub)urban background locations in the Netherlands. Measurements were done six times for a week during a six month period in 2008. High contrasts between busy streets and background locations in the same city were found for chromium, copper and iron (factor 2–3). These elements were especially present in the coarse fraction of PM. In addition, high contrasts were found for BC and NOx (factor 1.8), typically indicators of direct combustion emissions. The contrast for PNC was similar to BC. NO2 contrast was lower (factor 1.5). The largest contrast was found for two street canyons and two streets with buildings at one side of the street only. The contrast between busy streets and urban background in NO2 was less than the contrast found for BC, PNC and elements indicative of non-exhaust emissions, adding evidence that NO2 is not representing (current) traffic well. The study supports a substantial role for non-exhaust emissions including brake- and tyre wear and road dust in addition to direct combustion emissions. Significant underestimation of disease burden may occur when relying too much on the regulated components.},

   abstract = {A simple Monte Carlo single-box model is presented as a first approach toward examining the relationship between emissions of pollutants from fuel/cookstove combinations and the resulting indoor air pollution (IAP) concentrations. The model combines stove emission rates with expected distributions of kitchen volumes and air exchange rates in the developing country context to produce a distribution of IAP concentration estimates. The resulting distribution can be used to predict the likelihood that IAP concentrations will meet air quality guidelines, including those recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO). The model can also be used in reverse to estimate the probability that specific emission factors will result in meeting air quality guidelines. The modeled distributions of indoor PM2.5 concentration estimated that only 4% of homes using fuelwood in a rocket-style cookstove, even under idealized conditions, would meet the WHO Interim-1 annual PM2.5 guideline of 35 μg m−3. According to the model, the PM2.5 emissions that would be required for even 50% of homes to meet this guideline (0.055 g MJ-delivered−1) are lower than those for an advanced gasifier fan stove, while emissions levels similar to liquefied petroleum gas (0.018 g MJ-delivered−1) would be required for 90% of homes to meet the guideline. Although the predicted distribution of PM concentrations (median = 1320 μg m−3) from inputs for traditional wood stoves was within the range of reported values for India (108–3522 μg m−3), the model likely overestimates IAP concentrations. Direct comparison with simultaneously measured emissions rates and indoor concentrations of CO indicated the model overestimated IAP concentrations resulting from charcoal and kerosene emissions in Kenyan kitchens by 3 and 8 times respectively, although it underestimated the CO concentrations resulting from wood-burning cookstoves in India by approximately one half. The potential overestimation of IAP concentrations is thought to stem from the model’s assumption that all stove emissions enter the room and are completely mixed. Future versions of the model may be improved by incorporating these factors into the model, as well as more comprehensive and representative data on stove emissions performance, daily cooking energy requirements, and kitchen characteristics.},

To access the relationship between the frequency of hospitalizations due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and air pollution.
Material-method
Time series study during a seven year period (2001–2007) in a semi-urban tourist Greek peninsula. Data were collected from the computerized database of Volos General Hospital and included on a daily basis all emergency admissions of adults (>14 years old) which required hospitalization due to respiratory or cardiovascular problems. Daily concentrations of ambient pollutants [particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mm (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NO, NO2, NOX) and ozone (O3)] were obtained from three monitoring stations. The impact of air pollutants on morbidity was studied through time series analysis. The effects of time trend, season, and other cyclical factors, temperature, and humidity were accounted for. Autocorrelation and overdispersion were corrected.
Results
There were significant associations between hospitalizations and all indicators of air pollution. Daily elevations in the concentrations of PM10, NO, CO and O3 increased significantly the number of hospitalizations for respiratory/cardiovascular causes both on the same day and at the next day (p < 0.05). Combined increase of CO and O3 and of PM10 and CO was associated with even higher hospitalization rates.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest a significant relationship between morbidity burden of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and the levels of air pollution; these results underline that reinforcement of measures which target to control ambient pollution, is necessary.},

Pollutant decay with distance or height was not statistically significant for O3, CO, or SO2. No clear distance decay pattern emerged for PM2.5. Compared to concentrations at ground level 30 m from curb side, concentrations at 10 m, 60 m, and 10 m at 9 m height were 83%, 45% and 54% higher, respectively. For NO, NO2, and NOx, however, there was a statistically significant decline in concentrations with distance with the decay most apparent from 30 m to 60 m from the road. Concentrations at 10 m from curb side at 9 m height were equivalent to (all wind conditions) or less than (downwind conditions) those at 30 m and ground level. These findings suggest that for protection of public health in the near road environment, vertical distance is an important determinant of exposure to pollutants that are key indicators of traffic related air pollution. This has implications for sensitive land use development in proximity to high volume traffic corridors.},

   abstract = {Introduction
Many reports regarding the effects of air pollution on children’s respiratory health have appeared in the scientific literature. Some investigators found increases in persistent cough and phlegm, bronchitis, and early respiratory infections in communities with poor air quality. The purpose of this survey was to compare the pulmonary function of children living in urban area of Tirana city with children living in suburban area of the city.
Material and methods
This survey is carried out during 2004–2005 period on 238 children living in urban area and in 72 children living in suburban area, measuring dynamic pulmonary function. A questionnaire was used to collect data on sex, current respiratory symptoms, allergy diagnosed by the physician, parent education and smoking habit of parents, presence of animals, synthetic carpets and moulds in their houses. The selection of schools, and children included in this survey was done by randomized method. Also, we have measured and classic air pollutants.
Results
Comparing the results of values of pulmonary function of two groups of children, we have shown that differences were significant (p 0.001), whereas comparing symptoms were for cough (p 0.011) and for phlegm (p 0.032). The level of particulate matter (PM10) and total suspended matter (TSP) were over the recommended limit values, whereas the levels of other pollutants have resulted within recommended levels of World Health Organization (WHO)
Conclusions
The results of this survey suggest that air pollution is associated with respiratory health of children causing a slight decrease in values of pulmonary function in children of urban area compared with those of suburban area.},

   abstract = {The “Provence Alpes Côte d’Azur” (PACA) region, in the South East of France, is one of Europe’s regions most influenced by the atmospheric pollution. During the last 15 years, the industrial emissions decrease caused an evolution of the atmospheric pollution nature. Nowadays, atmospheric pollution is more and more influenced by the road traffic, the dominating pollution source in urban zones for the PACA region. Combined with this intense road traffic, the strong hot season of the Mediterranean climate contributes to the region bad air quality; it is known to be one of the worse in Europe. The recognized air pollution effects over public health include increased risk of hospital admissions and mortality by respiratory or cardiovascular diseases. The combination of these serious pollution related health hazards with senior and children vulnerabilities leads to serious sanitary concerns. Over the 1990–2005 period, we obtained, using the non-parametric Mann–Kendall test from annual mortality dataset (CépiDC), decreasing trends for Asthma (−5.00%year−1), Cardiovascular (−0.73%year−1), Ischemic (−0.69%year−1) and cerebrovascular diseases (−3.10%year−1). However, for “Other heart diseases” (+0.10%year−1) and “Respiratory” (+0.10%year−1) an increase was observed. The development of an adequate tool to understand impacts of pollution levels is of utmost importance. Different pollutants have different health endpoints, information may be lost through the use of a single index consequently, in this study we present the modified formula of air quality index, based on Cairncross’s concept the Aggregate Risk Index (ARI). ARI is based on the relative risk of the well-established increased daily mortality, or morbidity, enabling an assessment of additive effects of short-term exposure to the main air pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, SO2, O3 and NO2 in order to account for the reality of the multiple exposures impacts of chemical agents. The ARI, developed per pathology, takes into account the possible adverse effects associated with the coexistence of all pollutants. This index will enable to communicate the health risks associated, from modelled or monitored pollutant concentrations, to the general population. The second step will consist in the construction of a prediction model of this sanitary index.},

The filter samples were analyzed for mass, black carbon, and up to 28 elements were determined using instrumental neutron activation analysis and Particle–Induced X–ray Emission (PIXE). The long–term database shows that PM mass at the urban area had higher mass, black carbon, and some elements than the one at the suburban area. Furthermore, it is found that mass and elemental concentrations were generally elevated in the coarse fractions whereas black carbon was the major content in fine fractions. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and multiple linear regression were applied to investigate for PM source fingerprints and apportionment. Source contributions and wind direction influence were also examined by use of conditional probability function (CPF) and potential source contribution function (PSCF). The PMF results indicated that major sources contributed to coarse fractions were soil, construction, whereas traffic and biomass burning were the major sources for fine fractions. CPF and PSCF models assisted in determining of the potential locations and/or the preferred pathways of these possible sources.},

In the vicinity of the city of Amyndaion in Northern Greece, there is a large mine that provides lignite for the thermal power stations of the Hellenic Public Power Corporation. The excavated land is dumped in nearby open pits, which are planned to be extended towards South. These pits are sources of air–suspended particulate matter that can affect the nearby residential areas. The numerical model was applied for a number of specific meteorological scenarios, while the integral model for five years period. The results from both models showed an increase on the concentration levels, near the residential area, of two orders of magnitude if the dumps expand Southern. The models inter–comparison was based solely on the average yearly concentration and showed a fair agreement. Nevertheless, the numerical model tends to underestimate the concentration levels mainly because of the “limited” number of particles employed in the Langrangian model and the lack of wind–meandering.},

The total mass concentration decreased from 45±3μg/m3 at the industrial site, through 36±4μg/m3 at the commercial site to 30±2μg/m3 at the residential site. The largest component by mass was the organic fraction followed by sulfates, elemental carbon, nitrates, geological material, trace elements and salts. Carbonaceous aerosol accounted for 47% of the PM2.5 total mass, (31% organic and 16% elemental carbon), suggesting an origin from incomplete combustion processes and biomass burning among others. Zinc and lead were related to open waste burning and incineration, and showed an overall average of 0.28% and 0.09%, respectively. The concentrations of nickel and vanadium, that are related to fossil fuel combustion, were lower than 0.02%; these two elements were associated with sulfates. The results show that Al, Cr, Ni, Pb and V have a clear seasonality with higher concentrations in the late fall and lower in the early spring. The highest concentrations of these elements were observed at the north of Mexico City where most of the industrial activities take place.},

   abstract = {Biomass fuels are frequently used as a source of domestic energy in developing countries that may cause indoor air pollution. This study presents indoor and outdoor combustion pollutants (CO and NOx) and respirable particulate matter–RSPM (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0) concentrations measured during winter and summer seasons in 8 homes in Delhi, India. CO2 concentrations have been used to measure the outdoor airflow rates. This study further investigates variations in indoor/outdoor concentrations of the pollutants as a result of various activities in commercial (Site I) and institutional areas (Site II). The institutional area has been considered as the control site. Monitoring has been conducted at each site for 3 days in a week in both summer and winter seasons to investigate the diurnal variations of pollutant concentrations. Then, the I/O ratios have also been estimated. The correlation analysis of indoor pollutant concentrations with outdoor concentrations has been carried out. Winter/Summer (W/S) ratios have also been calculated and a two tailed t–test has been used to determine whether the winter and summer mean concentrations are significantly higher. The I/O ratios for PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0 at Site I homes, in winter season, have been found to be 1.43±0.84, 2.72±1.94 and 3.21±2.39, respectively. I/O ratio for CO has been found to be 2.99±2.19 in winters at Site I. The linear regression analysis results have revealed that usage of biomass fuels for cooking has increased the concentrations of RSPM and CO indoors, considerably in winter. W/S ratios for RSPM have also been found to be higher than 1.0 at almost all the homes indicating that the concentration of RSPM is higher in winter season. Regression analysis results indicated that the major sources for RSPM and CO exist indoors and that is principally, cooking using the biomass as fuels and also cleaning of homes manually, particularly at commercial site (NZM site). The results of this study also suggest that the indoor RSPM concentrations are mainly composed of the finer range of particles.},

   abstract = {Human exposure to air pollution transported from the Midwest is evaluated in eight New York State (NYS) regions over ten summers (1997 – 2006) for association with respiratory–related hospital admissions. Days when pollution is transported into the Northeastern United States (U.S.) were identified by using back–trajectories from the eight regions. These back–trajectories help identify predominant meteorological patterns associated with “polluted” air parcels (originating in the Midwest where power plant emissions are known to be relatively high) and “clean” air parcels (originating from the North where pollution is known to be relatively low). Ambient ozone concentrations measurements were used to validate the classification of “polluted” and “clean” air parcels. These classifications were then used to define the days of high– versus low–exposure for populations residing within each region. The results of this analysis indicate that the risk of being hospitalized for respiratory–related illness in NYS is greater on those days when air is transported from the Midwest as compared to days when air is transported from the North. Using a refined method to examine air parcels moving through a boundary drawn around high–emitting power plants in the Midwestern U.S. resulted in stronger associations across more regions (significant odds ratios ranging from 1.06 to 1.16 for the entire study time period for six of the eight NYS regions). An assessment of temperature and its impact on the odds ratio calculation in the New York City metropolitan region indicates that temperature alone does not explain the increased association between air pollution and respiratory–related hospital admissions.},

   abstract = {Development of strategies to control urban air pollution is a complex and multi–disciplinary process. In most real life cases, relevant policy making is characterised by the lack of information related to the economic value of the health consequences attributed to air pollution. This information is important to possess reliable economic estimates for the benefit arising from the application of the proposed strategies. This paper presents a contingent valuation approach in order to elicit the willingness–to–pay (WTP) for reducing the risk of premature mortality attributed to air pollution based on an easy–to–comprehend questionnaire. The economic value of increasing life expectancy by saving one year of life loss through improving air quality is estimated for Thessaloniki, Greece, which is considered one of the most polluted –if not the most polluted– cities within Europe, especially with respect to airborne particles. A sample of approximately 800 residents was chosen and a face–to–face interview was conducted using a hypothetical open–ended question designed to elicit the respondents WTP. Change in life expectancy was well understood and the results showed that 78.2% of respondents were able to express their WTP. The mean WTP to save one Year of Life Loss (YOLL) is approximately 920 € per person per year, which corresponds to a Value of a Life Year (VOLY) that is approximately 41 000 €.},

   abstract = {Wood from seven species of trees grown in the Portuguese forest (Pinus pinaster, Eucalyptus globulus, Quercus suber, Acacia longifolia, Quercus faginea, Olea europea and Quercus ilex rotundifolia), and briquettes produced from forest biomass waste were burned in a fireplace and in a woodstove to determine the chemical composition of fine particle (PM2.5) emissions. Samples were analysed for organic and elemental carbon (OC/EC), water soluble ions (Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl−, NO3− and SO42−) and 67 elements. The PM2.5 emission factors (gkg−1 fuel burned, dry basis) were in the ranges 9.9–20.2 and 4.2–16.3, respectively, for the fireplace and the woodstove. Organic carbon contributed to about 50% of the fine particle mass in the emissions from every wood species studied in both burning appliances. The carbonaceous component of PM2.5 was dominated by organic carbon, accounting for more than 85% of the total carbon (TC): OC/TC ranged from 0.85 to 0.96 (avg. 0.92) for the fireplace and from 0.86 to 0.97 (avg. 0.93) for the woodstove. The water-soluble ions accounted for 0.64 to 11.3% of the PM2.5 mass emitted from the fireplace, whereas mass fractions between 0.53 and 13.6% were obtained for the woodstove. The golden wattle wood smoke showed a much higher ionic content than the emissions from the other wood types. Trace elements represented 0.4 to 2.5% and 0.2 to 2.2% of the PM2.5 mass emitted, respectively, from the fireplace and the woodstove, which corresponded to average total emissions of 132±77.3mgkg−1 and 93.4±60.8mgkg−1 of wood burned. Among these, K, Pb, Al, Mn and Sr were present in all samples. From the emission profiles of the individual experiments, composite wood combustion profiles are suggested with the aid of a cluster analysis.},

The distribution of trace metals is considerably diverse in indoor and outdoor particulates. Average concentrations of Fe, Zn, Co, Cr and Mn are significantly higher in outdoor particulates, whereas Cu and Pb levels are considerably higher in the indoor particulates. Source apportionment carried out by PCA and CA is diverse in indoor/outdoor particulates and the major pollution sources identified are industrial activities, automobile emissions and soil derived dust. Among the trace metals, Cd, Sb, Zn, Pb and Co are found to be highly enriched in the atmospheric particulate matter. The present atmospheric trace metals levels are also compared with those reported from other regions around the world, and are many-folds higher than previously reported results.},

T0 samples contained more Cu, Zn, and carbon whereas; T1 samples contained more of Al, Si, P, S, and K (p < 0.05). Only SO4−2 increased in T1 during the influence periods. Oxidative potential correlated with Cu/Zn content (r = 0.74; p < 0.05) but not with biological effects. T1 PM10 induced greater hemolysis and T0 PM10 induced greater DNA degradation. Influence/non-influence did not affect oxidative potential nor biological effects. Results indicate that ventilation patterns had little effect on intrinsic PM10 composition and toxicological potential, which suggests a significant involvement of local sources.},

The results showed that PAEs could significantly reduce embryo hatchability, increase developmental malformations, and suppress the metamorphosis of abalone larvae. The possible toxicological mechanisms of PAEs to abalone embryos included, affecting the Na+–K+-pump and Ca2+–Mg2+-pump activities, altering the peroxidase (POD) level and the malondialdehyde (MDA) production, damaging the extraembryonic membranes structure, as well as disrupting endocrine-related genes (gpx, cyp3a, and 17β-hsd 12) expression properties. Taken together, this work showed that PAEs adversely affected the embryonic ontogeny of abalone. The abilities of PAEs affecting the osmoregulation, inducing oxidative stress, damaging embryo envelope structure, and causing physiological homeostasis disorder, are likely to be a part of the common mechanisms responsible for their embryonic toxicity.},

Ultrafine PM concentrations decayed exponentially with distance from a cross street with unrestricted traffic flow, reaching background levels within 100 m of the source. IL-6 induction was typically highest on Friday afternoons but showed no clear relationship to the presence of traffic. The coarse fraction (>2.5 μm) had the greatest intrinsic inflammatory capacity, suggesting that coarse PM still warrants attention even as the research focus is shifting to nano-particles.},

We investigated the impact of ozone (O3) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and allergen content of ragweed pollen (Ambrosia artemisiifolia). Pollen was exposed to acute O3 fumigation, with analysis of pollen viability, ROS and nitric oxide (NO) content, activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD[P]H) oxidase, and expression of major allergens. There was decreased pollen viability after O3 fumigation, which indicates damage to the pollen membrane system, although the ROS and NO contents were not changed or were only slightly induced, respectively. Ozone exposure induced a significant enhancement of the ROS-generating enzyme NAD(P)H oxidase. The expression of the allergen Amb a 1 was not affected by O3, determined from the mRNA levels of the major allergens. We conclude that O3 can increase ragweed pollen allergenicity through stimulation of ROS-generating NAD(P)H oxidase.},

This study identified the lag effects of mean temperature on mortality among age groups and death categories using polynomial distributed lag models in Brisbane, Australia, a subtropical city, 1996–2004. For a 1 °C increase above the threshold, the highest percent increase in mortality on the current day occurred among people over 85 years (7.2% (95% CI: 4.3%, 10.2%)). The effect estimates among cardiovascular deaths were higher than those among all-cause mortality. For a 1 °C decrease below the threshold, the percent increases in mortality at 21 lag days were 3.9% (95% CI: 1.9%, 6.0%) and 3.4% (95% CI: 0.9%, 6.0%) for people aged over 85 years and with cardiovascular diseases, respectively. These findings may have implications for developing intervention strategies to reduce and prevent temperature-related mortality.},

Strong spatial heterogeneity was observed for all outdoor pollutant concentrations. Concentrations of all pollutants, except coarse PM, were higher in high traffic zones than in the respective low traffic zones. Black carbon and NO2 appear to be better traffic indicators than fine PM. Indoor air pollution was found to be well associated with outdoor air pollution, although differences existed due to uncontrollable factors involving student activities and building/ventilation configurations. Results of this study indicate substantial spatial variability of pollutants in the region, suggesting that children’s exposures to these pollutants vary based on the location of their school.},

Although previous studies have identified the mineral components of CFA, there is a paucity of information on the structural habits of these minerals. Samples from UK, Polish and Chinese power stations were studied to further our understanding of the factors that affect CFA geochemistry and mineralogy. ICP-MS, FE-SEM/EDX, XRD, and laser diffraction were used to study physicochemical characteristics. Analysis revealed important differences in the elemental compositions and particle size distributions of samples between sites. Microscopy of HF acid-etched CFA revealed the mullite present possesses a fibrous habit; fibres ranged in length between 1 and 10 μm. Respirable particles (<10 μm) were frequently observed to contain fibrous mullite. We propose that the biopersistence of these refractory fibres in the lung environment could be contributing towards chronic lung diseases seen in communities and individuals continually exposed to high levels of CFA.},

Breakpoint models were applied for determining the increase in mortality above and below a threshold (equivalent) temperature. Generally, a ’V’-shaped (equivalent) temperature–mortality curve with increasing mortality at low and high temperatures was observed. Particularly, urban areas suffered from heat-related mortality with a steep increase above a specific threshold. This adverse heat effect may well increase with ongoing urbanization and the intensification of the urban heat island due to the densification of building structures.

Several in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that metal-rich particles may enhance allergic responses to house dust mites and induce an increased release of allergy-related cytokines.
Objectives
The main goal of this analysis is to define the possible association of intrauterine exposure to lead and mercury with the occurrence of skin sensitization to common aeroallergens in early childhood.
Material and methods
The present study refers to a sample of 224 women in the second trimester of pregnancy recruited from Krakow inner city area who had full term pregnancies and whose children underwent skin prick testing (SPT) at the age of 5. Lead and mercury levels were assessed in cord blood and retested in children at age of 5 years. Aeroallergen concentrations in house dust were measured at the age of 3 years. The main health outcome (atopic status) was defined as the positive SPT to at least one common aeroallergen (Der f1, Der p1, Can f1 and Fel d1) at the age of 5 years. In the statistical analysis of the association between atopic status of children and exposure to metals, the study considered a set of covariates such as maternal characteristics (age, education, atopy), child’s gender, number of older siblings, prenatal (measured via cord blood cotinine) and postnatal environmental tobacco smoke together with exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as measured by PAH-DNA adducts.
Results and conclusion
In the binary regression analysis, which controlled for the confounders, the risk ratio (RR) estimate for atopic sensitization was significantly associated with the lead exposure (RR=2.25, 95%CI: 1.21−4.19). In conclusion, the data suggest that even very low-level of prenatal lead exposure may be implicated in enhancing sensitization to common aeroallergens in early childhood.},

   abstract = {We investigated the mass concentration, mineral composition and morphology of particles resuspended by children during scheduled physical education in urban, suburban and rural elementary school gyms in Prague (Czech Republic). Cascade impactors were deployed to sample the particulate matter. Two fractions of coarse particulate matter (PM10−2.5 and PM2.5−1.0) were characterized by gravimetry, energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy. Two indicators of human activity, the number of exercising children and the number of physical education hours, were also recorded. Lower mass concentrations of coarse particulate matter were recorded outdoors (average PM10−2.5 4.1–7.4μgm−3 and PM2.5−1.0 2.0–3.3μgm−3) than indoors (average PM10−2.5 13.6–26.7μgm−3 and PM2.5−1.0 3.7–7.4μgm−3). The indoor concentrations of coarse aerosol were elevated during days with scheduled physical education with an average indoor–outdoor (I/O) ratio of 2.5–16.3 for the PM10−2.5 and 1.4–4.8 for the PM2.5−1.0 values. Under extreme conditions, the I/O ratios reached 180 (PM10−2.5) and 19.1 (PM2.5−1.0). The multiple regression analysis based on the number of students and outdoor coarse PM as independent variables showed that the main predictor of the indoor coarse PM concentrations is the number of students in the gym. The effect of outdoor coarse PM was weak and inconsistent. The regression models for the three schools explained 60–70% of the particular dataset variability. X-ray spectrometry revealed 6 main groups of minerals contributing to resuspended indoor dust. The most abundant particles were those of crustal origin composed of Si, Al, O and Ca. Scanning electron microscopy showed that, in addition to numerous inorganic particles, various types of fibers and particularly skin scales make up the main part of the resuspended dust in the gyms. In conclusion, school gyms were found to be indoor microenvironments with high concentrations of coarse particulate matter, which can contribute to increased short-term inhalation exposure of exercising children.},

Pollinosis is found more frequently in urban areas than in rural environments. This could be partly related to the different types of pollen exposure in these dissimilar areas. The objective of this study was to compare the distribution of pollen in these environments across an urbanization gradient.
Methods
Daily pollen abundances were obtained in France using Hirst-type sensors. Sampling was conducted from January to June in 2003 and 2006 in a rural area, a semi-rural area and in two urban areas, which were characterized by several urbanization criteria.
Results
Total allergenic pollen abundance was higher in rural and semi-rural areas than in urban areas irrespective of the sampling year. Multivariate analyses showed that pollen exposures differed according to the type of area and were strongly explained by the urbanization gradient. Grass, ash, birch, alder, hornbeam, hazel and plantain pollen quantities exceeded the allergy threshold more often in rural settings than in urban areas. In urban areas, only plane pollen quantities exceeded the allergy threshold more often than in rural areas.
Conclusions
Allergenic pollen exposure is higher in rural areas than in urban areas, and the most abundant pollen in each area did not originated from the same taxa. This result should be taken into account in epidemiological studies comparing allergies in rural and urban areas to adapt the panel of pollen extracts for human environmental exposure. In addition, this study highlights that some ornamental trees produce a large number of allergenic pollens and provide new sources of aeroallergens.},

The effects of prenatal exposure to environmental levels of dioxins on immune function during infancy have not been clarified, although dioxins induce immunosuppression in offspring of animals. Moreover, human studies have not assessed the effects of gender- or congener-specific differences. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between dioxin levels in maternal blood and the risk of infection and allergies in infancy. We examined 364 mothers and their infants enrolled in a Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health between 2002 and 2005 in Sapporo, Japan. Relevant information was collected from a baseline questionnaire during pregnancy, medical records at delivery, and a follow-up questionnaire when the child was 18 months of age that assessed development of allergies and infections in infancy. Dioxin-like compound levels in maternal blood were measured with high-resolution gas chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. Relatively higher levels of polychlorinated dibenzofuran were associated with a significantly increased risk of otitis media, especially among male infants (odds ratio=2.5, 95% confidence interval=1.1–5.9). Relatively higher levels of 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran were also associated with a significantly increased risk of otitis media (odds ratio=5.3, 95% confidence interval=1.5–19). However, we observed a weak association between dioxin-like compound levels and allergic symptoms in infancy. At environmental levels, prenatal exposure to dioxin-like compounds may alter immune function and increase the risk of infections in infancy, especially among males. The compound 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran may be responsible for this.},

   abstract = {The Talamanca County in Costa Rica has large-scale banana and small-scale plantain production, probably causing pesticide exposure in indigenous children. We explored to what extent different community actors are aware of children's pesticide hazards and how their awareness related to socio-economical and cultural conditions. Methods comprised eight focus groups with fathers and mothers separately, 27 semi-structured interviews to key actors, and field observations. As a whole, the indigenous plantain farmers and banana plantation workers had some general knowledge of pesticides concerning crop protection, but little on acute health effects, and hardly any on exposure routes and pathways, and chronic effects. People expressed vague ideas about pesticide risks. Inter-community differences were related to pesticide technologies used in banana and plantain production, employment status on a multinational plantation versus smallholder status, and gender. Compared to formalized practices on transnational company plantations, where workers reported to feel protected, pesticide handling by plantain smallholders was not perceived as hazardous and therefore no safety precautions were applied. Large-scale monoculture was perceived as one of the most important problems leading to pesticide risks in Talamanca on banana plantations, and also on neighboring small plantain farms extending into large areas. Plantain farmers have adopted use of highly toxic pesticides following banana production, but in conditions of extreme poverty. Aerial spraying in banana plantations was considered by most social actors a major determinant of exposure for the population living nearby these plantations, including vulnerable children. We observed violations of legally established aerial spraying distances. Economic considerations were most mentioned as the underlying reason for the pesticide use: economic needs to obtain the production quantity and quality, and pressure to use pesticides by other economic agents such as middlemen. Risk perceptions were modulated by factors such as people's tasks and positions in the production process, gender, and people's possibilities to define their own social conditions (more fatalistic perceptions among banana workers). The challenge for the future is to combine these insights into improved health risk assessment and management that is culturally adequate for each particular community and agricultural context.},

We included 41 schoolchildren, 8–12 years old, who had been diagnosed with atopic dermatitis. For 67 consecutive days, all of them measured their symptoms in a diary. To assess exposure, the daily ambient mass concentrations of particulate matter less than 10, 2.5 and 1μm (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1, respectively) and concentrations of submicron particles (0.01–1μm) were measured at a local school. The mean mass concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 were 74.0, 57.8 and 50.8μg/m3, respectively. The mean concentrations were 41,335/cm3 ultrafine particles (UFPs) and 8577/cm3 accumulation mode (0.1–1μm) particles. Significant associations were found between the concentrations of ultrafine particles and the itchiness symptom in children with atopic dermatitis. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in previous day ultrafine particles concentration (IQR: 28–140/m3) was significantly associated with a 3.1% (95% confidence interval, 0.2–6.1) increase in the itch symptom score for children with atopic dermatitis.

We studied 749 school beginners living in four Ni-polluted industrial areas of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. We assessed Ni in ambient air, Ni in urine from children and mothers, and Ni in tap water, conducted patch tests in children (including the NiSO4-dilution test) and collected questionnaire data. Statistics were done by linear and logistic regression analyses, adjusted for covariates. At increased Ni concentration in ambient air (unit of increase: 10ng/m3), urinary Ni concentrations rose in both mothers (9.1%; 95% CI: 6.8–11.4%) and children (2.4%; 95% CI: 0.4–4.4%).

Asthma morbidity has been associated with ambient air pollutants in time-series and case-crossover studies. In such study designs, threshold effects of air pollutants on asthma outcomes have been relatively unexplored, which are of potential interest for exploring concentration–response relationships.
Methods
This study analyzes daily data on the asthma morbidity experienced by the pediatric Medicaid population (ages 2–18 years) of Detroit, Michigan and concentrations of pollutants fine particles (PM2.5), CO, NO2 and SO2 for the 2004–2006 period, using both time-series and case-crossover designs. We use a simple, testable and readily implementable profile likelihood-based approach to estimate threshold parameters in both designs.
Results
Evidence of significant increases in daily acute asthma events was found for SO2 and PM2.5, and a significant threshold effect was estimated for PM2.5 at 13 and 11μgm−3 using generalized additive models and conditional logistic regression models, respectively. Stronger effect sizes above the threshold were typically noted compared to standard linear relationship, e.g., in the time series analysis, an interquartile range increase (9.2μgm−3) in PM2.5 (5-day-moving average) had a risk ratio of 1.030 (95% CI: 1.001, 1.061) in the generalized additive models, and 1.066 (95% CI: 1.031, 1.102) in the threshold generalized additive models. The corresponding estimates for the case-crossover design were 1.039 (95% CI: 1.013, 1.066) in the conditional logistic regression, and 1.054 (95% CI: 1.023, 1.086) in the threshold conditional logistic regression.
Conclusion
This study indicates that the associations of SO2 and PM2.5 concentrations with asthma emergency department visits and hospitalizations, as well as the estimated PM2.5 threshold were fairly consistent across time-series and case-crossover analyses, and suggests that effect estimates based on linear models (without thresholds) may underestimate the true risk.},

   abstract = {Background
Several epidemiological studies demonstrate associations between high summer temperatures and increased mortality. However, the quantitative implications of projected future increases in temperature have not been well characterized.
Objective
This study quantifies the effects of projected future temperatures on both mortality and morbidity in California, including the potential effects of mitigation.
Data and methods
We first estimated the association between temperature and mortality for populations close to weather stations throughout the state. These dose–response estimates for mortality were then combined with local measures of current and projected changes in population, and projected changes in temperature, using a baseline of average temperatures from 1961 to 1990, for the years 2025 and 2050. The latter were based on two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (A2 and B1) developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In addition, we assessed the impacts of future adaptation through use of air conditioners. Several sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the likely range of estimates.
Results
These analyses indicate that for the high emissions scenario, the central estimate of annual premature mortality ranges from 2100 to 4300 for the year 2025 and from 6700 to 11,300 for 2050. The highest estimates are from the models that use age-specific dose–response functions, while the low estimates are from the models that adjust for ozone. Estimates using the low emissions scenario are roughly half of these estimates. Mitigation based on our estimates of the effects of 10% and 20% increase in air conditioner use would generate reductions of 16% and 33% in the years 2025 and 2050, respectively.
Conclusion
Our estimates suggest significant public health impacts associated with future projected increases in temperature.},

   abstract = {Insight into the mechanisms by which ambient air particulate matter mediates adverse health effects is needed to provide biological plausibility to epidemiological studies demonstrating an association between PM10 exposure and increased morbidity and mortality. In vitro studies of the effects of air pollution on human cells help to establish conditions for the analysis of cause–effect relationships. One of the major challenges is to test native atmosphere in its complexity, rather than the various components individually. We have developed an in vitro system in which human monocyte-macrophage U937 cells are directly exposed to filters containing different amounts of PM10 collected in the city of Rome. Transcriptional profiling obtained after short exposure (1h) of cells to a filter containing 1666μg PM10 (77.6μg/cm2) using a macroarray panel of 1176 genes reveals a significant change in the mRNA level (>2 fold) for 87 genes relative to cells exposed to a control filter. Overall, 9 out of 87 modulated genes were annotated as “lung cancer”. qRT-PCR confirmed the induction of relevant genes involved in DNA repair and apoptosis, specifically: ERCC1, TDG, DAD1 and MCL1. In cells exposed for 10min, 1h and 3h to different amounts of PM10, transcription of TNFα and TRAP1, which code for a key pro-inflammatory cytokine and a mitochondrial protein involved in cell protection from oxidative stress, respectively, was shown to be modulated in a time-dependent, but not a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these data indicate that it is possible to analyze the effects of untreated particulate matter on human cells by the direct-exposure approach we have developed, possibly providing new clues to traffic-related health hazard.},

   abstract = {Objective
Biofuel from sugarcane is widely produced in developing countries and is a clean and renewable alternative source of energy. However, sugarcane harvesting is mostly performed after biomass burning. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of harvesting after biomass burning on nasal mucociliary clearance and the nasal mucus properties of farm workers.
Methods
Twenty seven sugarcane workers (21–45 years old) were evaluated at the end of two successive time-periods: first at the end of a 6-month harvesting period (harvesting), and then at the end of a 3-month period without harvesting (non-harvesting). Nasal mucociliary clearance was evaluated by the saccharine transit test, and mucus properties were analyzed using in vitro mucus contact angle and mucus transportability by sneeze. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, body temperature, associated illness, and exhaled carbon monoxide were registered.
Results
Data are presented as mean values (95% confidence interval). The multivariate model analysis adjusted for age, body-mass index, smoking status and years of working with this agricultural practice showed that harvesting yielded prolonged saccharine transit test in 7.83min (1.88–13.78), increased mucus contact angle in 8.68 degrees (3.18–14.17) and decreased transportability by sneeze in 32.12mm (−44.83 to −19.42) compared with the non-harvesting period. No significant differences were detected in any of the clinical parameter at either time-period.
Conclusion
Sugarcane harvesting after biomass burning negatively affects the first barrier of the respiratory system in farm workers by impairing nasal mucociliary clearance and inducing abnormal mucus properties.},

   abstract = {Investigators have consistently demonstrated associations between elevated temperatures and mortality worldwide. Few have recently focused on identifying vulnerable subgroups, and far fewer have determined whether at least some of the observed effect may be a manifestation of mortality displacement. We examined mean daily apparent temperature and mortality in 13 counties in California during the warm season from 1999 to 2006 to identify age and disease subgroups that are at increased risk, and to evaluate the potential effect of mortality displacement. The time-series method using the Poisson regression was applied for data analysis for single lag days of 0–20 days, and for cumulative average lag days of five and ten days. Significant associations were observed for the same-day (excess risk=4.3% per 5.6°C increase in apparent temperature, 95% confidence interval: 3.4, 5.2) continuing up to a maximum of three days following apparent temperature exposure for non-accidental mortality. Similar risks were found for mortality from cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and among children zero to 18 years of age, and adults and the elderly 50 years and older. Since no significant negative effects were observed in the following single or cumulative days, evidence of mortality displacement was not found. Thus, the effect of temperature on mortality appears to be an event that occurs within three days following exposure, and requires immediate attention for prevention.},

The study hypothesis is that higher birth-defect rates are present in mountaintop mining areas. National Center for Health Statistics natality files were used to analyze 1996–2003 live births in four Central Appalachian states (N=1,889,071). Poisson regression models that control for covariates compare birth defect prevalence rates associated with maternal residence in county mining type: mountaintop mining areas, other mining areas, or non-mining areas. The prevalence rate ratio (PRR) for any birth defect was significantly higher in mountaintop mining areas compared to non-mining areas (PRR=1.26, 95% CI=1.21, 1.32), after controlling for covariates. Rates were significantly higher in mountaintop mining areas for six of seven types of defects: circulatory/respiratory, central nervous system, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, urogenital, and ‘other’. There was evidence that mountaintop mining effects became more pronounced in the latter years (2000–2003) versus earlier years (1996–1999.) Spatial correlation between mountaintop mining and birth defects was also present, suggesting effects of mountaintop mining in a focal county on birth defects in neighboring counties. Elevated birth defect rates are partly a function of socioeconomic disadvantage, but remain elevated after controlling for those risks. Both socioeconomic and environmental influences in mountaintop mining areas may be contributing factors.},

This study investigated mortality risks from all causes, circulatory and respiratory diseases for the elderly associated with prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures in four major cities of Taiwan.
Methods
Daily average temperatures at the high 99th, 97th, and 95th percentiles were defined as extreme heat, and those at the low 10th, 5th, and 1st percentiles were defined as extreme cold for each city in 1994–2007. Distributed lag non-linear model was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of mortality associated with 30-day lag temperature, and heat and cold extremes lasting for 3–5, 6–8, and >8 days. The random-effects meta-analysis summarized the risks of temperature and extreme temperatures events.
Results
The lowest overall mortality among the elderly was when the temperature was 26°C on average. Low temperatures caused greater adverse effects than high temperatures, particularly for mortality from circulatory diseases. After accounting for the cumulative 30-day temperature effects, meta-analysis showed that mortality risk slightly increased with strengthened and prolonged heat extremes (≥99th and >3 days; ≥97th and >8 days; and ≥ 95th and >8 days) that RRs ranged from 1.04–1.05, 1.01–1.05, and 1.05–1.13 for mortality from all causes and from circulatory and respiratory diseases, respectively. The corresponding RRs ranged from 0.98–1.01, 0.92–1.06, and 0.97–1.03, respectively, for shorter duration of heat extremes. This study did not identify significant effect for stronger or prolonged cold extremes.
Conclusions
Extreme temperatures and their duration cause varied mortality associations in the elderly. Short-term extremely low temperatures exhibit the greatest effect on mortality, and intensified and longer periods of heat extremes also exert a slightly increased effect on mortality.},

However, many recent epidemiological studies have consistently shown positive associations between low-level exposure to air pollutants and health outcomes. In Portugal, very few studies have analysed the acute effect of air pollutants on health. The present study evaluates the association between exposure to air pollution and daily mortality in the Oporto Metropolitan Area, Portugal. Generalised additive models were used for this analysis. Pollutants assessed were ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter (PM10). Models were adjusted for time trend, seasonality, and weather. We report that an increase of 10μg/m3 in the daily ozone 8-h maximum moving-average corresponds to an increase of 0.95% (95%CI: 0.30, 1.60) and 1.58% (95%CI: 0.45, 2.73) in non-accidental mortality and cardiovascular mortality, respectively, in the summer season. A significant effect of 0.67% (95% CI: 0.03:1.32) was also found for the association between PM10 and non-accidental mortality in the summer season. Associations with ozone and PM10 exposures were higher in the elderly people. No significant effects on mortality were observed during the summer season with nitrogen dioxide exposures. Our analyses provide the first significant evidence in Oporto that exposures to O3 and PM10 have adverse effects on the health of the general population in the summer months.},

Municipal solid waste landfills are sources of air pollution that may affect the health and quality of life of neighboring communities.
Objectives
To investigate health and quality of life concerns of neighbors related to landfill air pollution.
Methods
Landfill neighbors were enrolled and kept twice-daily diaries for 14d about odor intensity, alteration of daily activities, mood states, and irritant and other physical symptoms between January and November 2009. Concurrently, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) air measurements were recorded every 15-min. Relationships between H2S, odor, and health outcomes were evaluated using conditional fixed effects regression models.
Results
Twenty-three participants enrolled and completed 878 twice-daily diary entries. H2S measurements were recorded over a period of 80d and 1-h average H2S=0.22ppb (SD=0.27; range: 0–2.30ppb). Landfill odor increased 0.63 points (on 5-point Likert-type scale) for every 1ppb increase in hourly average H2S when the wind was blowing from the landfill towards the community (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.29, 0.91). Odor was strongly associated with reports of alteration of daily activities (odds ratio (OR)=9.0; 95% CI: 3.5, 23.5), negative mood states (OR=5.2; 95% CI: 2.8, 9.6), mucosal irritation (OR=3.7; 95% CI=2.0, 7.1) and upper respiratory symptoms (OR=3.9; 95% CI: 2.2, 7.0), but not positive mood states (OR=0.6; 95% CI: 0.2, 1.5) and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (OR=1.0; 95% CI: 0.4, 2.6).

We applied the approach proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) using the AirQ 2.2.3 software developed by the WHO European Centre for Environment and Health, Bilthoven Division. Daily concentrations of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter ≤10μm (PM10) and ≤2.5μm (PM2.5) were used to assess human exposure and health effects in terms of attributable proportion of the health outcome, annual number of excess cases of mortality for all causes, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Long-term effects were estimated for PM2.5 as years of life lost. Considering short-term effects, PM2.5 had the highest health impact on the 24,000 inhabitants of the two small towns, causing an excess of total mortality of 8 out of 177 in a year. Ozone and nitrogen dioxide each caused about three excess cases of total mortality. Results on long-term effects showed, respectively, 433, 180, and 72 years of life lost for mortality for all causes, cardiopulmonary diseases and lung cancer, in a year. These results are consistent with other reports of the impact of air quality on human health and the AirQ software seems an effective and easy tool, helpful in decision-making.},

Increases in mortality associated with oppressive weather have been widely investigated in several epidemiological studies. However, to properly understand the full public health significance of heat-related health effects, as well as to develop an effective surveillance system, it is also important to investigate the impact of stressful meteorological conditions on non-fatal events. The objective of our study was to evaluate the exposure–response relationship of ambulance dispatch data in association with biometeorological conditions using time series techniques similar to those used in previous studies on mortality.
Methods
Daily data of emergency ambulance dispatches for people aged 35 or older in the summer periods from 2002 to 2006 were collected for the major towns in the Emilia–Romagna region. In the first stage of the analysis, the city-specific relationship between daily ambulance dispatches and increasing apparent temperature was explored using Generalized Additive Models while controlling for air pollution, seasonality, long-term trend, holidays and weekends. The relationship between ambulance dispatches and apparent temperature was approximated by linear splines. The effects of high temperatures on health were evaluated for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases as well as for all non-traumatic conditions. In the second stage of the analysis, city-specific effects were combined in fixed or random effect meta-analyses.
Results
The percent change in the ambulance dispatches associated with every 1°C increase in the mean apparent temperature between 25 and 30°C was 1.45% (95% confidence interval: 0.95, 1.95) for non-traumatic diseases and 2.74% (95% CI: 1.34, 4.14) for respiratory diseases. The percent increase in risk was greater on days in which the mean apparent temperature exceeded 30°C (8.85%, 95% CI: 7.12, 10.58 for non-traumatic diseases). In this interval of biometeorological conditions, cardiovascular diseases became positively associated with the apparent temperature. The risks increased with age. The increase in risk for the non-traumatic diseases reached 13.34% for people aged 75 or older compared to 4.75% for those aged 35–64.
Conclusion
Time series analysis techniques were adopted for the first time to investigate emergency ambulance dispatches to evaluate the risks associated with biometeorological discomfort. Our findings show a strong relationship between biometeorological conditions and ambulance dispatches.},

Children are sensitive to indoor environmental pollution. Up until now there has been a lack of data on air quality in child day care centers.
Objectives
The aim of this study is to document the indoor environment quality of Paris child day care centers by repeated measurements, and to compare pollutant levels in child day care centers with levels in Paris dwellings.
Methods
We selected 28 child day care centers frequented by a random sample of babies who participated in the PARIS birth cohort environmental investigation, and visited the child day care centers for one week twice in one year. Biological contaminants assessed were fungi, endotoxin, dust mite allergens, and chemical pollutants: aldehydes, volatile organic compounds and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Relative humidity, temperature, and carbon dioxide levels were measured simultaneously. A standardized questionnaire was used to gather information about the buildings and their inhabitants.
Results
Airborne endotoxin levels in child day care centers were higher than those found in Paris dwellings. Dust mite allergens in child day care centers were below the threshold level for sensitization in the majority of samples, and in common with dwelling samples. Penicillium and Cladosporium were the most commonly identified genera fungi. The child day care center indoor/outdoor ratio for most chemical pollutants was above unity except for NO2, the levels for NO2 being significantly higher than those measured in homes.
Conclusion
Chemical and biological contamination in child day care centers appears to be low, apart from endotoxin and NO2. Failure to take child exposure in child day care centers into account could result in an overestimation of children's exposure to other pollutants.},

El Paso County (Texas) is prone to still air inversions and is one of the dust “hot spots” in North America. In this context, we examined the sub-lethal effects of airborne dust and low wind events on human respiratory health (i.e., asthma and acute bronchitis) between 2000 and 2003, when 110 dust and 157 low wind events occurred. Because environmental conditions may not affect everyone the same, we explored the effects of dust and low wind within three age groups (children, adults, and the elderly), testing for effect modifications by sex and insurance status, while controlling for weather and air pollutants.
Methods
We used a case-crossover design using events matched with referent days on the same day-of-the-week, month, and year with conditional logistic regression to estimate the probability of hospital admission, while controlling for apparent temperature (lag 1), nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter of 2.5μm or less.
Results
Children (aged 1–17) were 1.19 (95% confidence interval: 1.00–1.41) times more likely to be hospitalized for asthma three days after a low wind event, and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.01–1.75) times more likely to be hospitalized for acute bronchitis one day after a dust event than on a clear day. Girls were more sensitive to acute bronchitis hospitalizations after dust events (1.83, 95% CI: 1.09–3.08) than boys, but less sensitive than boys to acute bronchitis hospitalizations after low wind events (0.68, 95% CI: 0.46−1.00). We found general trends with regard to dust and low wind events being associated with increased odds of hospitalization for asthma and bronchitis amongst all ages and adults (aged 18–64). Adults covered by Medicaid and adults without health insurance had higher risks of hospitalization for asthma and acute bronchitis after both low wind and dust events.
Conclusions
Results suggest that there were respiratory health effects associated with dust and low wind events in El Paso, with stronger impacts among children and poor adults. Girls and boys with acute bronchitis were differentially sensitive to dust and low wind events.},

We made use of newly developed distributed lag non-linear Poisson models, constrained to a 30 day lag period, and we adjusted for temporal trends and nitrogen dioxide and ozone. We found a strong non-linear association with high daily maximum temperatures showing an apparent threshold at about 27°C; this association persisted until about lag 5 days. For example, we found across all lag periods that daily non-accidental mortality increased by 28.4% (95% confidence interval: 13.8–44.9%) when temperatures increased from 22.5 to 31.8°C (75–99th percentiles). This association was essentially invariant to different smoothers for time. Cold temperatures were not found to be associated with daily mortality over 30 days, although there was some evidence of a modest increased risk from 2 to 5 days. The adverse association with colder temperatures was sensitive to the smoother for time. For cardio-respiratory mortality we found increased risks for higher temperatures of a similar magnitude to that of non-accidental mortality but no effects at cold temperatures.},

Urban air pollutants are associated with cardiovascular events. Traffic controllers are at high risk for pollution exposure during outdoor work shifts.
Objective
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between air pollution and systemic blood pressure in traffic controllers during their work shifts.
Methods
This cross-sectional study enrolled 19 male traffic controllers from Santo André city (São Paulo, Brazil) who were 30–60 years old and exposed to ambient air during outdoor work shifts. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings were measured every 15min by an Ambulatory Arterial Blood Pressure Monitoring device. Hourly measurements (lags of 0–5h) and the moving averages (2–5h) of particulate matter (PM10), ozone (O3) ambient concentrations and the acquired daily minimum temperature and humidity means from the São Paulo State Environmental Agency were correlated with both systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Statistical methods included descriptive analysis and linear mixed effect models adjusted for temperature, humidity, work periods and time of day.
Results
Interquartile increases of PM10 (33μg/m3) and O3 (49μg/m3) levels were associated with increases in all arterial pressure parameters, ranging from 1.06 to 2.53mmHg. PM10 concentration was associated with early effects (lag 0), mainly on systolic blood pressure. However, O3 was weakly associated most consistently with diastolic blood pressure and with late cumulative effects.
Conclusions
Santo André traffic controllers presented higher blood pressure readings while working their outdoor shifts during periods of exposure to ambient pollutant fluctuations. However, PM10 and O3 induced cardiovascular effects demonstrated different time courses and end-point behaviors and probably acted through different mechanisms.},

We explored effect modification patterns by season, sex, age and by the presence of desert dust transported mainly from the Sahara area. We used daily time-series data provided by the children's hospitals and the fixed monitoring stations. The associations were investigated using Poisson regression models controlling for seasonality, weather, influenza episodes, day of the week and holiday effects.

O3 was associated with a statistically significant increase in asthma admissions among older children in the summer. Our findings provide limited evidence of an association between NO2 exposure and asthma exacerbation. Statistically significant PM10 effects were higher during winter and during desert dust days, while SO2 effects occurred mainly during spring. Our study confirms previously reported PM10 effects on emergency hospital admissions for pediatric asthma and further provides evidence of stronger effects during desert dust days.

Extreme air pollution events due to bushfire smoke and dust storms are expected to increase as a consequence of climate change, yet little has been published about their population health impacts. We examined the association between air pollution events and mortality in Sydney from 1997 to 2004.
Methods
Events were defined as days for which the 24h city-wide concentration of PM10 exceeded the 99th percentile. All events were researched and categorised as being caused by either smoke or dust. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design with conditional logistic regression modelling adjusted for influenza epidemics, same day and lagged temperature and humidity. Reported odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals are for mortality on event days compared with non-event days. The contribution of elevated average temperatures to mortality during smoke events was explored.
Results
There were 52 event days, 48 attributable to bushfire smoke, six to dust and two affected by both. Smoke events were associated with a 5% increase in non-accidental mortality at a lag of 1 day OR (95% confidence interval (CI)) 1.05 (95%CI: 1.00–1.10). When same day temperature was removed from the model, additional same day associations were observed with non-accidental mortality OR 1.05 (95%CI: 1.00–1.09), and with cardiovascular mortality OR (95%CI) 1.10 (95%CI: 1.00–1.20). Dust events were associated with a 15% increase in non-accidental mortality at a lag of 3 days, OR (95%CI) 1.16 (95%CI: 1.03–1.30).
Conclusions
The magnitude and temporal patterns of association with mortality were different for smoke and dust events. Public health advisories during bushfire smoke pollution episodes should include advice about hot weather in addition to air pollution.},

Various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been related to respiratory health effects, but have generally been assessed individually without taking into account the fact that such pollutants are highly correlated to one other.
Aims
We investigated the effects of exposure to various VOC, and considered their combined effect on adult asthma and rhinitis.
Method
A national cross-sectional representative survey conducted by the Indoor Air Quality Observatory objectively assessed 20 VOCs in 490 main dwellings in France. A standardized questionnaire determined the prevalence of asthma and rhinitis among 1012 inhabitants of the dwellings (≥15 years). Marginal models for binary outcome were used to relate VOCs exposure to asthma and rhinitis, controlling for potential confounders. A global score representing the number of VOCs in each dwelling with an elevated concentration (using the 3rd quartile value of the distribution as a threshold value) was then derived as a measure of the combined effect of VOCs. Specific scores were built using a similar approach, grouping VOCs by family.
Results
Asthma (8.6%) was significantly associated with N-undecane and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and rhinitis (38.3%) with ethylbenzene, trichloroethylene, m/p- and o-xylene. The global VOC score was associated with a significant risk of asthma and rhinitis (odds ratio (OR) of 1.40 and 1.22, respectively, for 5 additional VOCs with high exposure level). Both specific scores for aromatic hydrocarbons and aliphatic hydrocarbons were associated with a significantly risk of asthma (OR=1.12; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01–1.24 and OR=1.41; 95% CI=1.03–1.93, respectively). The specific VOC score for halogenated hydrocarbons was associated with a significant risk of rhinitis (OR=1.28; 95% CI: 1.07–1.54).
Conclusion
We have shown that high concentrations of VOCs in homes were associated with an increasing prevalence of asthma and rhinitis in adults.},

Air pollution has been associated with adverse cardiovascular effects.
Objective
To measure the association between air pollution, spirometry, blood pressure, and exercise capacity.
Methods
We used data from 5604 subjects collected during the Canada Health Measures Survey to test the association between air pollution measured on the day of the survey and spirometry (n=5011 subjects), blood pressure, and exercise capacity (n=3789 subjects).
Results
An interquartile range (IQR) increase in ozone (17.0ppb) was significantly associated with a 0.883% higher resting heart rate, a 0.718% higher systolic and 0.407% higher diastolic blood pressure, a 0.393% lower FEV1/FVC expressed as a percentage of predicted, and a 1.52% reduction in the aerobic fitness score (p<0.05). Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure were approximately 0.5mmHg higher for an (IQR 4.5μg/m3) increase in PM2.5 (IQR 4.5μg/m3) and 1mmHg higher for a 12.6ppb increase in NO2 (IQR 12.6ppb). An increase in PM2.5 was also associated with an approximate 0.4% decrease in percent predicted FEV1 and FVC (p<0.05).
Conclusion
Exposure to higher concentrations of air pollution was associated with higher resting blood pressure and lower ventilatory function. Ozone was associated with reduced exercise capacity.},

Maternal exposure to air pollution has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Few studies took into account the spatial and temporal variation of air pollution levels.
Objectives
To evaluate the impact of maternal exposure to traffic-related air pollution during pregnancy on preterm birth and term birth weight using a spatio-temporal exposure model.
Methods
We estimated maternal residential exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5) and soot during pregnancy (entire pregnancy, 1st trimester, and last month) for 3853 singleton births within the Dutch PIAMA prospective birth cohort study by means of temporally adjusted land-use regression models. Associations between air pollution concentrations and preterm birth and term birth weight were analyzed by means of logistic and linear regression models with and without adjustment for maternal physical, lifestyle, and socio-demographic characteristics.
Results
We found positive, statistically non-significant associations between exposure to soot during entire pregnancy and during the last month of pregnancy and preterm birth [adj. OR (95% CI) per interquartile range increase in exposure 1.08 (0.88–1.34) and 1.09 (0.93–1.27), respectively]. There was no indication of an adverse effect of air pollution exposure on term birth weight.
Conclusions
In this study, maternal exposure to traffic-related air pollution during pregnancy was not associated with term birth weight. There was a tendency towards an increased risk of preterm birth with increasing air pollution exposure, but statistical power was low.},

   abstract = {Background
Daily variations in the levels of air pollution are well known to be associated with daily variations in mortality counts. Given the large number of time-series studies, there is little need for simple replication of these results in additional locations. However, additional analyses of time-series data might be useful in elucidating remaining questions on the role of air pollution on mortality.
Objectives
Because of ongoing issues related to causality, changing toxicity, the difficulty in isolating the independent effects of individual pollutants, the availability of new methods to detect effect thresholds, and questions about the extent to which effects are restricted to frail members of the population, additional analyses of time-series data might be helpful in addressing these issues. We show an example where additional time-series analyses can be helpful in elucidating specific questions in the field of air pollution epidemiology.
Methods
We analysed daily mortality and air pollution data using Poisson regression in generalised additive models. Air pollution data for the overall period 1992–2006 and for four different periods were analysed to assess the overall risk estimates for the whole period and to assess variability over time for the different effect estimates.
Results and Conclusion
We found some statistically significant upward trends, but this was only the case for a few associations without a consistent pattern over the cause-specific deaths. Whether these findings are consistent over time or whether our findings are merely the result of statistical chance can only be elucidated by continuation of monitoring of the relative risks over time in the future. Although these results may indicate that both photochemical and particulate matter air pollution might have become more toxic, the lack of a clear pattern in the results makes these conclusions speculative.},

   abstract = {Exposures to ambient air traffic-related pollutants and their sources have been associated with respiratory and asthma morbidity in children. However, longitudinal investigation of the effects of traffic-related exposures during early childhood is limited. We examined associations of residential proximity and density of traffic and stationary sources of air pollution with wheeze, asthma, and immunoglobulin (Ig) E among New York City children between birth and age 5 years. Subjects included 593 Dominican and African American participants from the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health cohort. Prenatally, through age 5 years, residential and respiratory health data were collected every 3–6 months. At ages 2, 3, and 5 years, serum IgE was measured. Spatial data on the proximity and density of roadways and built environment were collected for a 250m buffer around subjects' homes. Associations of wheeze, asthma, total IgE, and allergen-specific IgE with prenatal, earlier childhood, and concurrent exposures to air pollution sources were analyzed using generalized estimating equations or logistic regression. In repeated measures analyses, concurrent residential density of four-way intersections was associated significantly with wheeze (odds ratio: 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.57). Age 1 exposures also were associated with wheeze at subsequent ages. Concurrent proximity to highway was associated more strongly with total IgE (ratio of the geometric mean levels: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.42) than were prenatal or earlier childhood exposures. Positive associations also were observed between percent commercial building area and asthma, wheeze, and IgE and between proximity to stationary sources of air pollution and asthma. Longitudinal investigation suggests that among Dominican and African American children living in Northern Manhattan and South Bronx during ages 0–5 years, residence in neighborhoods with high density of traffic and industrial facilities may contribute to chronic respiratory morbidity, and concurrent, prenatal, and earlier childhood exposures may be important. These findings may have broad implications for other urban populations that commonly have high asthma prevalence and exposure to a high density of traffic and stationary air pollution sources.},

We quantified the relative contributions to PM2.5 from both secondhand smoke and infiltrating outdoor sources in US casinos. We measured real-time PM2.5, particulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PPAH), and carbon dioxide (CO2) (as an index of ventilation rate) inside and outside 8 casinos in Reno, Nevada. We combined these data with data from previous studies, yielding a total of 66 US casinos with smoking in California, Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, developing PM2.5 frequency distributions, with 3 nonsmoking casinos for comparison. Geometric means for PM2.5 were 53.8μg/m3 (range 18.5–205μg/m3) inside smoking casinos, 4.3μg/m3 (range 0.26–29.7μg/m3) outside those casinos, and 3.1μg/m3 (range 0.6–9μg/m3) inside 3 nonsmoking casinos. In a subset of 21 Reno and Las Vegas smoking casinos, PM2.5 in gaming areas averaged 45.2μg/m3 (95% CI, 37.7–52.7μg/m3); adjacent nonsmoking casino restaurants averaged 27.2μg/m3 (95% CI, 17.5–36.9μg/m3), while PM2.5 outside the casinos averaged 3.9μg/m3 (95% CI, 2.5–5.3μg/m3). For a subset of 10 Nevada and Pennsylvania smoking casinos, incremental (indoor–outdoor) PM2.5 was correlated with incremental PPAH (R2=0.79), with ventilation rate-adjusted smoker density (R2=0.73), and with smoker density (R2=0.60), but not with ventilation rates (R2=0.15). PPAH levels in 8 smoking casinos in 3 states averaged 4 times outdoors. The nonsmoking casinos' PM2.5 (n=3) did not differ from outdoor levels, nor did their PPAH (n=2). Incremental PM2.5 from secondhand smoke in approximately half the smoking casinos exceeded a level known to produce cardiovascular morbidity in nonsmokers after less than 2h of exposure, posing acute health risks to patrons and workers. Casino ventilation and air cleaning practices failed to control secondhand smoke PM2.5. Drifting PM2.5 from secondhand smoke contaminated unseparated nonsmoking areas. Smoke-free casinos reduced PM2.5 to the same low levels found outdoors.},

In this study we investigated the ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) at public parks and in park-adjacent neighborhoods for metropolitan Los Angeles. Socioeconomic and racial-ethnic inequalities in exposure to the three criteria pollutants were also investigated using multiple linear regression models. In addition, differences in inhalation doses from breathing the three +criteria pollutants were investigated for the top and bottom quartile racial composition in the parks and neighborhoods. Our research showed that although public parks had on average the lowest pollutant concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5, they had relatively high O3 concentrations. Park-adjacent neighborhoods, by contrast, had the highest NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations, but the lowest O3 concentrations. Higher exposures to NO2 and PM2.5 were systematically identified for the lower socioeconomic position or higher minority population neighborhoods. For children and adolescents aged 6–15 engaging in high and moderate intensity activities in and around public parks, those from the top quartile of primarily Hispanic neighborhoods had much higher (63%) inhaled doses of NO2 compared to the bottom quartile counterpart. PM2.5 showed a similar but less pronounced pattern of inhalation doses. Evidence of socioeconomic and racial-ethnic gradients was found in air pollution exposure and inhalation doses in and around the urban parks in Los Angeles. This suggests that patterns of exposure inequality found in other environmental justice research are present in exposures in and around urban parks.},

   abstract = {The relevance of climate change for society seems indisputable: scientific evidence points to a significant human contribution in causing climate change, and impacts which will increasingly affect human welfare. In order to meet national and international greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets, there is an urgent need to understand and enable societal engagement in mitigation. Yet recent research indicates that this involvement is currently limited: although awareness of climate change is widespread, understanding and behavioral engagement are far lower. Proposals for mitigative 'personal carbon budgets' imply a need for public understanding of the causes and consequences of carbon emissions, as well as the ability to reduce emissions. However, little has been done to consider the situated meanings of carbon and energy in everyday life and decisions. This paper builds on the concept of 'carbon capability', a term which captures the contextual meanings associated with carbon and individuals' abilities and motivations to reduce emissions. We present empirical findings from a UK survey of public engagement with climate change and carbon capability, focusing on both individual and institutional dimensions. These findings highlight the diverse public understandings about 'carbon', encompassing technical, social, and moral discourses; and provide further evidence for the environmental value-action gap in relation to adoption of low-carbon lifestyles. Implications of these findings for promoting public engagement with climate change and carbon capability are discussed. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Background
The evaluation of exhaled breath profiles by electronic nose (eNose) is considered as a promising non-invasive diagnostic tool, and the discrimination of breathprints between patients with COPD and asthma has been reported. The aim of this study was to assess, whether exhaled breath profile analysis can detect the inflammatory airway response induced by ozone inhalation.
Methods
In a randomized double-blind, cross-over study 14 healthy ozone-responsive subjects were exposed to 250ppb ozone and filtered room air for 3h with intermittent exercise. Blood biomarkers, exhaled NO, exhaled CO, and breathprints (Cyranose 320®) were assessed prior and at 3 time points up to 24h post exposure. Induced sputum was collected at baseline and 3h post exposure. Multivariate analysis of eNose data was performed using transformed and normalized datasets.
Results
Significantly increased numbers of sputum and blood neutrophils were observed after ozone, whereas the eNose signals showed no differences between exposures and no correlation with neutrophilic airway inflammation. However, independent of ozone exposure, sensor data correlated with serum SP-D levels and to a smaller extent with blood neutrophil numbers.
Conclusions
Exhaled breath profiles as measured by the Cyranose 320® did not reflect airway responses to ozone. This suggests that exhaled volatiles did not change with ozone challenges or that the changes were below the detection limits. Conversely, the correlation of eNose signals with blood neutrophils and serum SP-D, i.e. markers of systemic inflammation and lung permeability, suggested that the Cyranose 320® can detect volatile organic compounds of systemic origin.},

Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality caused by cigarette smoking and other environmental exposures. While variation in exposures may affect COPD morbidity and mortality, little is known about geographic variation, a surrogate of exposures. The objective of this manuscript is to explore the geographic variation in COPD hospitalization rates among the Texas population in 2006.
Methods
The study population consisted of all Texas residents with COPD hospitalizations in the 2006 Texas Health Care Information Council (THCIC) data. County population estimates stratified by race, age, and gender were linked to THCIC data to calculate county level COPD hospitalization rates per 100,000 admissions. The data were merged with Urban Influence Codes by county, and metropolitan status was determined by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) criteria. Variation in COPD hospitalization rates were analyzed using Poisson Regression.
Results
Overall, non Hispanic (NH) Whites had the highest rate of hospitalization, followed by NH Blacks (rate ratio = 0.42) and Hispanics (RR = 0.17), the 65+ age category had the highest rates of hospitalization. In the metropolitan counties COPD hospitalization rates were lower than non-metropolitan counties, however in metropolitan counties the rates of hospitalization were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in females compared to males. The rates were significantly higher in males in public health regions 10 and 11, which are predominantly non-metropolitan counties.
Conclusions
In Texas there is substantial geographic variation in hospitalization rates associated with gender and race/ethnicity. Other factors that may contribute to the variation and require further investigation include differences in smoking and exposure to other environmental risk factors, access to primary care, medical practice patterns, and coding practices.},

   abstract = {Summary
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by chronic inflammation in airways and lung parenchyma. CD8+ T-lymphocytes, crucial effector and regulatory cells in inflammation, are increased in the central and peripheral airways in COPD. The aim of this study was to assess the role of apoptosis in the accumulation of CD8+ T-lymphocytes within the airway wall in COPD. We examined the submucosa of transverse sections of central and peripheral airways from post-operative tissues from non-smokers (n = 16), smokers with normal lung function (n = 16), smokers with mild/moderate COPD (n = 16), and smokers with severe/very severe COPD (n = 9). TUNEL and immunohistochemistry techniques were used to identify apoptosis and cell phenotype, respectively. The percentage of apoptotic CD8+ T-lymphocytes was significantly lower (p < 0.0001) in smokers with mild/moderate COPD than in non-smokers, smokers with normal lung function, and smokers with severe/very severe COPD, and was positively related to values of FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio, both in central and in peripheral airways. These data suggest that reduced apoptosis of CD8+ T-lymphocytes may be an important mechanism that contributes to the accumulation of these cells in the airway submucosa in smokers with mild/moderate COPD.},

Purpose
Sputum analysis is important in COPD exacerbation management. We determined whether application of stringent quality control criteria for sputum samples had an impact on culture results.
Methods
We analyzed sputum samples of 108 patients during stable COPD and during exacerbations. To all samples quality control standards and culture interpretation rules according to the American Society of Microbiologists (ASM) were applied.
Results
In sputum exacerbation samples considered appropriate according to ASM quality standards, criteria for infection (40%) were met more often compared to inappropriate samples (13%) (p<0.001). The same pattern was observed when applying these rules to sputum samples obtained during stable disease, (50% vs. 18%, p<0.001). There was no difference in the percentage of infectious cultures obtained during the stable state and exacerbations.
Conclusions
Applying stringent quality control criteria to sputum samples can have a profound effect on the labeling of sputum samples as infectious, and therefore on clinical decision making.},

The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of asthma, atopy and COPD in Rwanda and to identify risk factors. The survey was conducted in Kigali, the Capital of Rwanda, and in Huye District, a rural area located in southern Rwanda.
Methods
A total of 2138 subjects were invited to participate in the study.1920 individuals (90%) answered to questionnaires on respiratory symptoms and performed spirometry, 1824 had acceptable spirograms and performed skin-prick test. In case of airflow obstruction (defined as pre-bronchodilator ratio FEV1/FVC < LLN) a post bronchodilator spirometry was performed. Reversibility was defined as an increase in FEV1 of 200 ml and 12% above baseline FEV1 after inhalation of 400 mcg of salbutamol.
Results
The mean age was 38.3 years; 48.1% of participants were males and 51.9% females. Airflow obstruction was found in 256 participants (14%); 163(8.9%) subjects were asthmatics and 82 (4.5%) had COPD. COPD was found in 9.6% of participants aged 45 years and above. 484 subjects had positive skin-prick tests (26.5%); house dust mite and grass pollen mix were the main allergens. Risk factors for asthma were allergy, female gender and living in Kigali. COPD was associated with cigarette smoking, age and male sex.
Conclusion
this is the first study which shows the prevalence of atopy, asthma and COPD in Rwanda. Asthma and COPD were respectively diagnosed in 8.9% and 4.5% of participants. COPD was diagnosed in 9.6% of subjects aged ≥45 years.The prevalence of asthma was higher in urban compared to rural area.},

Background
Spirometry is a frequently performed lung function test and an important tool in medical surveillance examinations of pulmonary diseases. The interpretation of lung function relies on the comparison to reference values derived from a healthy population. The study aim was to compare the lung function data of three representative population-based German studies (Study of Health in Pomerania [SHIP-1], Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg [KORA-S3] and European Community Respiratory Health Survey Erfurt [ECRHS-I Erfurt]) with existing European spirometry reference values and to establish a new set of comprehensive German prediction equations.
Methods
Spirometry was performed in 4133 participants of three population-based surveys using almost identical standardised methods. Current and former smokers, subjects with cardiopulmonary disorders or on medication with potential influence on lung function were excluded. Sex specific prediction equations were established by quantile regression analyses. Comparison was performed to existing European reference values.
Results
The healthy reference sample consisted of 1302 (516 male) individuals, aged 20–80 years. Sex specific comprehensive prediction equations adjusted for age and height are provided. Significant differences were found in comparison to previous studies with pronounced lower values of the current population if applying historic prediction equations.
Conclusion
The results contribute to the interpretation of lung function examination in providing a comprehensive set of spirometry reference values obtained in a large number of healthy volunteers. Whereas the differences in between the investigated studies are negligible, striking divergence was detected in comparison to historic and recent European spirometry prediction values.},

Introduction
The asthma mortality pattern differs among countries. No published evidence is currently available on asthma mortality in a European low-middle-income country in socioeconomic transition. We analyzed the trend of asthma mortality rate in Serbia during the period 1980 2009.
Materials and Methodology
a descriptive study; source of data: Republic of Serbia Institute of Statistics Death Registry. We analyzed asthma mortality data in the total population, including gender specific analysis, and in the selected >5 34 year age group. The International Classification of Diseases codes for asthma 493 (1980 1996) and J45+J46 (1997 2009) were included. Population estimates were based on 1991 and 2002 census data, with extrapolation.
Results
The over-all average mortality rate was 7.27±2.14/100,000 inhabitants. The mortality rate peaked in 1981 at 11.3/100,000 but was 4.45/100,000 in the last year of analysis. While both overall mortality rate, as well as gender specific rates, showed clear decreases over the observed 30-year period (average absolute annual decrease of 0.195/100,000 inhabitants, 0.241/100,000 men and 0.149/100,000 women; p <0.001) with corresponding relative annual decreases of 2.9% for the whole population, 3.0% for men and 2.8% for women, a stable trend of the rate was found in the age group >5-34 years. Male-to-female ratio was 1.59±0.186, on average and it showed a stable trend over the observed period.
Conclusion
Although the failure of the health care system during the socioeconomic crisis of the 1990s might have transiently affected asthma mortality rates, the overall mortality rate for the disease shows a favorable decreasing trend.},

Aims
Pro-oxidant iron provides a potential measure of iron-catalysed oxidative stress in biological fluids. This study aimed, to investigate if the Bleomycin technique for measurement of pro-oxidant iron in biological fluids could be utilised for determinations in exhaled breath condensate (EBC). Secondly, to measure levels of pro-oxidant iron in EBC from asthmatics after exposure to polluting city environments.
Methods
Retrospective analysis of samples of EBC and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Pro-oxidant iron levels were determined by the Bleomycin method. Transferrin levels were determined by radial diffusion immunoassay and lactoferrin by ELISA.
Subjects
: Patients undergoing surgery necessitating cardiopulmonary bypass, normal healthy controls, "healthy" smokers, and asthmatics (mild and moderate).
Results
Pro-oxidant iron was significantly decreased (p<0.05) post cardiac surgery in both EBC and BALF. In smokers levels of pro-oxidant iron in EBC were significantly (p<0.05) increased verses healthy controls. In asthmatics with more severe disease, there were significant increases in EBC pro-oxidant iron content post exposure to city environments (p<0.001), with levels most elevated after exposure to the most polluted setting.
Conclusion
Similar patterns in the levels of pro-oxidant iron detectable in EBC and paired BALF from patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (pre and post surgery) suggest a potential for EBC determinations. Significantly elevated levels in EBC from smokers relative to control subjects provide further support for this technique. In asthma disease severity and environmental exposure influenced levels of pro-oxidant iron measured in EBC indicating a potential for enhanced iron-catalysed oxidative stress.},

Background
Worldwide, asthma and COPD are common causes of disability or death. Few studies have been made concerning the association with socioeconomic status (SES) and these diseases. Purpose and methods: The aim of this nationwide population-based study was to determine the association with educational and income levels (SES) and chronic airway diseases (CAD), i.e., asthma or COPD (FEV1/FVC < 0.70). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to estimate odds ratios in relation to education and household income, using age, gender, smoking in lifetime and body mass index as possible confounders.
Results
In this population-based cohort aged ≥30 years the prevalence of asthma was 9% (588/6525). COPD was observed in 5% (338/6525) of research subjects. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis when adjusted for gender, age, smoking history and BMI, the basic educational level remained an independent risk factor for COPD (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2–2.6) and the low household income for asthma (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0–1.9).
Conclusions
In this large survey low SES measured by educational and income levels are risk factors of asthma and COPD.},

Background
While a large amount of data about the epidemiology of asthma, COPD, chronic bronchitis and respiratory symptoms are available from developed countries, the information about these diseases in developing countries in south-east Asia are scarce.
Aim
Assess the prevalence of respiratory diseases and symptoms and their relation with demographic data including smoking habits among adults in rural and urban Vietnam.
Methods
A random sample of subjects aged 21–70 years were invited; 3008 subjects living in an inner city area of Hanoi and 4000 in a rural area of Bavi in northern Vietnam. An internationally used questionnaire was delivered by field workers to the study subjects. The questionnaire was completed by the subjects, or when necessary, by the field workers after reading the questions for the study participants.
Results
The response rate was 92% in Bavi and 70% in Hanoi. Of men in Bavi 67.8% (Hanoi 49.7%; p < 0.001) were smokers, while of women 4.2% were smokers in Hanoi (Bavi 1.2%; p < 0.001). The prevalence of ever asthma was in Hanoi 5.6% (Bavi 3.9%; p = 0.003) with no major gender difference. The most common symptom was longstanding cough (Hanoi 18.1%, Bavi 12.0%; p < 0.001) followed by sputum production, while the prevalence of symptoms common in asthma was considerably lower. Although the large difference in smoking habits, respiratory symptoms tended to be only slightly more common in men than women. Family history of asthma and chronic bronchitis, respectively, were strongly associated with both diseases.
Conclusions
The prevalence of asthma in adults may have increased in both urban and rural Vietnam, as the few previous estimates have found 2% of adults having asthma. Half of men in Hanoi and two-thirds in Bavi were smokers versus a few percent of women in both areas. Bronchitic symptoms were common in both men and women.},

Background
Previously, we reported that prenatal exposures to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and postnatal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in combination were associated with respiratory symptoms at ages 1 and 2 years. Here, we hypothesized that children exposed to both prenatal PAH and ETS may be at greater risk of asthma and seroatopy at ages 5–6 years, after controlling for current pollution exposure.
Methods
Prenatal PAH exposure was measured by personal air monitoring over 48 h. ETS exposure, respiratory symptoms and asthma at ages 5–6 years were assessed through questionnaire. Immunoglobulin (Ig) E was measured by Immunocap.
Results
A significant interaction between prenatal PAH and prenatal (but not postnatal) ETS exposure on asthma (p < 0.05), but not IgE, was detected. Among children exposed to prenatal ETS, a positive nonsignificant association was found between prenatal PAH exposure and asthma (OR 1.96, 95% CI [0.95–4.05]). Among children without exposure to prenatal ETS, a negative nonsignificant association was found between prenatal PAH exposure and asthma (OR 0.65, 95% CI [0.41–1.01]). Prenatal PAH exposure was not associated with asthma or IgE at age 5–6 years.
Conclusions
Combined prenatal exposure to PAH and ETS appears to be associated with asthma but not seroatopy at age 5–6. Exposure to PAH alone does not appear associated with either asthma or seroatopy at age 5–6 years. Discerning the differential effects between ETS exposed and ETS nonexposed children requires further study.},

Background
Immigration usually implies a complete change of the environment where one lives. Hence, studies on immigrants may help to disentangle genetic and environmental determinants of disease. We investigated whether the incidence of allergic and respiratory symptoms differed for Italian and immigrant children living in one area of Northern Italy.
Methods
In December 2006, all the children (3–14 years) living in the Viadana district were surveyed through a parental questionnaire (response rate = 99%, n = 3854). Retrospective incidences of several symptoms were compared across different ethnic groups.
Results
Parental asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema were less frequent in immigrant children than in Italian children. Wheezing and eczema incidences were lower in children born to foreign parents (especially if born abroad, incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.26–0.82 and IRR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.23–0.83, respectively), with respect to Italian children, while the occurrence of nasal allergies was similar among the ethnic groups. The greatest incidence of persistent cough/phlegm was observed in children born in Italy to foreign parents (IRR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.06–3.71) and in children whose parents had chronic bronchitis (IRR = 2.57, 95% CI: 1.52–4.33).
Conclusions
Considering the distribution of parental atopic diseases and the low disease prevalence in the immigrants’ countries of origin, we suggest that nasal allergies may be more sensitive than wheezing or eczema to the change in the environment related to migration. Genetic or environmental factors clustered into families seem to have a role on chronic bronchitis.},

The SVF values at the coordinates of the fish eye pictures were calculated with three numerical models (SkyHelios, ArcView SVF extension, and SOLWEIG) with a 3D building data base as input. After comparing the results of the first run, a deviation occurs. The deviation disappears after implementing an option to include a weighting factor in some of the models.},

   abstract = {During the June 1996 eruption of Mt Ruapehu, New Zealand, traces of fine particulate volcanic ash were observed in or near the cities of Hamilton and Auckland, 166–282 km from the volcano. Although no health impacts in these cities were attributed to the eruption, hospital records at both cities for the following month show the highest rates of respiratory mortality for the 1990s. Alternative explanations for this increase in respiratory mortality were investigated, including urban air pollution, adverse weather conditions and influenza. Comparable records from Wellington city, assumed to be outside the zone of ash dispersal, were used as a ‘control’. Our results suggest that at Hamilton, where non-volcanic factors can largely be eliminated as making a significant contribution, diffuse volcanic ashfall may have been an important factor in respiratory mortality during the weeks following the eruption. At Auckland, further away from the volcano but with a much larger population than Hamilton, a case for a weaker volcanic contribution can be made, but is more equivocal because of coincidentally high urban air pollution and cold, stable weather. These findings support the concept that diffuse fine volcanic ash poses a risk to respiratory health at greater distances from an eruption than is currently perceived. This is because the finest ‘respirable’ fraction of erupted material with potentially hazardous physico-chemical properties is likely to be ejected highest into the atmosphere and dispersed the greatest distance. If significant amounts reach large cities, then large numbers of individuals may be at risk, especially those already suffering poor respiratory health. This work has important implications for environmental health and hazard management in New Zealand and in other regions that may be susceptible to a similar volcanic threat.},

   abstract = {This research evaluates commuter exposure to particulate matter during pre-journey commute segments for passengers waiting at bus stops by investigating 840 min of simultaneous exposure levels, both inside and outside seven bus shelters in Buffalo, New York. A multivariate regression model is used to estimate the relation between exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5 measured in μg m−3) and three vectors of determinants: time and location, physical setting and placement, and environmental factors. Four determinants have a statistically significant effect on particulate matter: time of day, passengers’ waiting location, land use near the bus shelter, and the presence of cigarette smoking at the bus shelter. Model results suggest that exposure to PM2.5 inside a bus shelter is 2.63 μg m−3 (or 18 percent) higher than exposure outside a bus shelter, perhaps due in part to the presence of cigarette smoking. Morning exposure levels are 6.51 μg m−3 (or 52 percent) higher than afternoon levels. Placement of bus stops can affect exposure to particulate matter for those waiting inside and outside of shelters: air samples at bus shelters located in building canyons have higher particulate matter than bus shelters located near open space.},

   abstract = {This study evaluates the health risks in megacities in terms of mortality and morbidity due to air pollution. A new spreadsheet model, Risk of Mortality/Morbidity due to Air Pollution (Ri-MAP), is used to estimate the excess numbers of deaths and illnesses. By adopting the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline concentrations for the air pollutants SO2, NO2 and total suspended particles (TSP), concentration-response relationships and a population attributable-risk proportion concept are employed. Results suggest that some megacities like Los Angeles, New York, Osaka Kobe, Sao Paulo and Tokyo have very low excess cases in total mortality from these pollutants. In contrast, the approximate numbers of cases is highest in Karachi (15,000/yr) characterized by a very high concentration of total TSP (∼670μgm−3). Dhaka (7000/yr), Beijing (5500/yr), Karachi (5200/yr), Cairo (5000/yr) and Delhi (3500/yr) rank highest with cardiovascular mortality. The morbidity (hospital admissions) due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) follows the tendency of cardiovascular mortality. Dhaka and Karachi lead the rankings, having about 2100/yr excess cases, while Osaka-Kobe (∼20/yr) and Sao Paulo (∼50/yr) are at the low end of all megacities considered. Since air pollution is increasing in many megacities, and our database of measured pollutants is limited to the period up to 2000 and does not include all relevant components (e.g. O3), these numbers should be interpreted as lower limits. South Asian megacities most urgently need improvement of air quality to prevent excess mortality and morbidity due to exceptionally high levels of air pollution. The risk estimates obtained from Ri-MAP present a realistic baseline evaluation for the consequences of ambient air pollution in comparison to simple air quality indices, and can be expanded and improved in parallel with the development of air pollution monitoring networks.},

To investigate the potential for health effects of exposure at these levels, we conducted a pilot study of subway workers comparing personal exposures to steel dust with biomarkers of metal exposure, oxidative stress, and DNA damage in blood and urine samples. Workers wore a personal air sampler operating at 4L/m for one to three work shifts with blood and urine samples collected at the end of the final shift. We found that PM2.5 exposures varied among subway workers on the basis of job title and job activity. The subway workers’ mean time-weighted PM2.5 exposure was 52μg/m3, with a median of 27μg/m3, and a range of 6–469μg/m3. The observed concentrations of PM2.5, iron, manganese, and chromium fell well below occupational standards. Biomarker concentrations among the 39 subway workers were compared with a group of 11 bus drivers, and a group of 25 suburban office workers. Concentrations of DNA–protein crosslinks and chromium in plasma were significantly higher in subway workers than in bus drivers, but no significant difference was observed for these biomarkers between subway workers and office workers. Urinary isoprostane concentrations were significantly correlated with the number of years working in the subway system, and were detected at higher, though not significantly higher, concentrations in subway workers than in bus drivers or office workers. At the group level, there was no consistent pattern of biomarker concentrations among subway workers significantly exceeding those of the bus drivers and office workers. At the individual level, steel dust exposure was not correlated with any of the biomarkers measured.},

Previous studies suggest that SO2 may have adverse health effects independent of other pollutants. In the Public Health and Air Pollution in Asia (PAPA) project, the short-term associations between ambient sulfur dioxide (SO2) and daily mortality were examined in Bangkok, Thailand, and three Chinese cities: Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Wuhan. Poisson regression models incorporating natural spline smoothing functions were used to adjust for seasonality and other time-varying covariates. Effect estimates were obtained for each city and then for the cities combined. The impact of alternative model specifications, such as lag structure of pollutants and degree of freedom (df) for time trend, on the estimated effects of SO2 were also examined. In both individual-city and combined analysis, significant effects of SO2 on total non-accidental and cardiopulmonary mortality were observed. An increase of 10μg/m3 of 2-day moving average concentrations of SO2 corresponded to 1.00% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75–1.24], 1.09% (95% CI, 0.71–1.47), and 1.47% (95% CI, 0.85–2.08) increase of total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, respectively, in the combined analysis. Sensitivity analyzes suggested that these findings were generally insensitive to alternative model specifications. After adjustment for PM10 or O3, the effect of SO2 remained significant in three Chinese cities. However, adjustment for NO2 diminished the associations and rendered them statistically insignificant in all four cities. In conclusion, ambient SO2 concentration was associated with daily mortality in these four Asian cities. These associations may be attributable to SO2 serving as a surrogate of other substances. Our findings suggest that the role of outdoor exposure to SO2 should be investigated further in this region.},

We assessed the short-term mortality effects of daily loss of visibility. During 1996–2006, we obtained mortality data for non-accidental and cardiorespiratory causes, visibility recorded as visual range in kilometers, temperature, and relative humidity from an urban observatory, and concentrations of four criteria pollutants. A generalized additive Poisson regression model with penalized cubic regression splines was fitted to control for time variant covariates. For non-accidental mortality, an interquartile range (IQR) of 6.5km decrease in visibility at lag0–1 days was associated with an excess risk (ER%) [95% CI] of 1.13 [0.49, 1.76] for all ages and 1.37 [0.65, 2.09] for ages 65 years and over; for cardiovascular mortality of 1.31 [0.13, 2.49] for all ages, and 1.72 [0.44, 3.00] for ages 65 years and over; and for respiratory mortality of 1.92 [0.49, 3.35] for all ages and 1.76 [0.28, 3.25] for ages 65 years and over. The estimated ER% for daily mortality derived from both visibility and air pollutant data were comparable in terms of magnitude, lag pattern, and exposure–response relationships especially when using particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10μm to predict the mortality associated with visibility. Visibility provides a useful proxy for the assessment of environmental health risks from ambient air pollutants and a valid approach for the assessment of the public health impacts of air pollution and the benefits of air quality improvement measures in developing countries where pollutant monitoring data are scarce.},

   abstract = {Background
Explorations of interactions between air pollution and seasonal changes have represented one approach in examining the consequences of global warming. However, only a few studies have focused on evaluating the effects of seasonal air pollution using data on both morbidity and mortality in Asia.
Method
We examined the associations between PM10 concentrations and mortality and hospital admissions in Seoul, Korea for the periods 2000–2006 and 2001–2006. We employed a temperature-matched case-crossover design, where reference periods matched case days in regard to temperature (same rounded to degrees celsius (°C)), month, and year.
Results
A total of 238,826 deaths were identified, along with 98,570 and 93,553 inpatient admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, respectively. We found that the association with PM10 and mortality/morbidity increased during the summer. During the study period, 10μg/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with the increase in mortality by 0.28% (95% confidence interval: 0.12, 0.44), 0.51% (0.19, 0.83), and 0.59% (–0.08, 1.26) for non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory causes. 10μg/m3 increase in PM10 was also associated with increase in hospitalization from cardiovascular and respiratory causes by 0.77% (0.53, 1.01) and 1.19% (0.94, 1.44). In the summer, the increase in mortality and hospitalization was 0.57% (0.20, 0.93), 0.64% (–0.10, 1.38), 0.50% (–1.02, 2.05), 1.52% (0.89, 2.16), and 1.55% (0.87, 2.22).
Conclusions
This study provides evidence that the effect of PM10 on mortality and morbidity varies with season and increases during the summer season.},

Exposure to urban pollutants in traffic policemen was characterized using the annual average concentrations of PM10, NO2 and benzene in the period 1998–2008 measured by fixed monitoring stations located in different areas of the city. A significant and increasing number of suspicious lung nodules with diameters between 5 and 10mm was observed: in traffic policemen (including smokers and non-smokers) vs. controls (including smokers and non-smokers); in total smokers (including traffic policemen and controls) vs. total non-smokers (traffic policemen and controls); in smoker traffic policemen vs. smoker controls and vs. non-smoker traffic policemen; in non-smoker traffic policemen vs. non-smoker controls. The RR of finding cases with at least one lung nodule with diameters between 5 and 10mm in traffic policemen (including smokers and non-smokers) compared to controls (including smokers and non-smokers) is 1.94 (CI 1.13–3.31); in total smokers vs. non-smokers the RR is 1.96 (CI 1.20–3.19). The comparison between the interaction exposure and smoking shows an increase in smoker traffic policemen than in smoker controls (RR=2.14; CI 1.02–4.52). The RR for smoker traffic policemen was higher than in non-smoker traffic policemen (RR=2.09; CI 1.19–3.66). The results of our study show that: (1) while smoker workers have a higher risk for developing solid suspicious lung nodules, the simple routinely exposure to urban pollutants is unable to produce the same kind of increased risk; (2) the interaction of smoking and exposure to urban pollutants greatly increases the risk for the development of solid suspicious lung nodules. In conclusion, the use of chest LD-CT in workers at risk helps identify suspicious solid lung nodules at early stage.},

Although environmental conditions may play role, information on the effects of air pollution exposure in this population is lacking. The present study was conducted in Athens, Greece, in order to investigate the adverse effects of long-term air pollution exposure on respiratory outcomes in mail carriers. A total of 226 mail carriers and 73 office employees were enroled. Information on respiratory symptoms, medical, occupational, residential and smoking history was obtained through a questionnaire. Flow-volume curves were performed in the workplace using a portable spirometer. Individualised personal exposure assessment has been applied based on long-term residential and occupational subject history linked with geographical air pollution distribution. Furthermore, personal measurements were obtained for forty-one mail carriers using NO2 and O3 passive samplers, assuming that current air pollution exposure is sufficiently representative of long-term, previous exposure to make a plausible link with current health status. The analysis based on exposures estimated on the basis of residential and work addresses showed that the most exposed to PM10 postal workers have rhinitis at a higher rate (OR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.01–2.75). In mail carriers there is indication that those exposed to higher concentrations of Ο3 or PM10 have a greater possibility to present rhinitis (OR=1.63, 95% CI: 0.93–2.88 and OR=1.70, 95% CI: 0.96–3.03, respectively). The effect of O3 on rhinitis became even more apparent in the analysis based on exposures assessed by personal measurements (OR=6.74, 95% CI: 1.24–36.55). Exposure to NO2 was significantly associated with decrements in lung function. For office employees the exposure to air pollutants was not associated to any adverse respiratory outcome. Our findings suggest that air pollution is a contributing factor for the occurrence of rhinitis and lung function impairment in mail carriers.},

   abstract = {Summary
Objective
The associations between air pollution and children’s respiratory health in the high pollution range have not yet been clearly characterized. We evaluated the effects of outdoor air pollution on respiratory morbidity in children selected from multiple sites in a heavy industrial province of northeastern China.
Methods
The study included 11,860 children aged 3–12 years, selected from 18 districts of 6 cities in Liaoning province, the participation rate is 89.9%. Informed consent and written responses to surveys about children’s historic and current health status, personal and household characteristics, and other information were obtained from parents. A two-stage regression approach was applied in data analyses.
Results
There were wide gradients for TSP (188–689 μg/m3), SO2 (14–140 μg/m3 and NO2 (29–94 μg/m3) across the 18 districts of 6 cities. The three air pollutants significantly increased the prevalence of persistent cough (21–28%), persistent phlegm (21–30%) and current asthma (39–56%) for each interquartile range increment (172 μg/m3 for TSP, 69 μg/m3 for SO2, 30 μg/m3 for NO2), showing larger between-city effects than within-city. Rates of respiratory symptoms were significantly higher for children with younger age, atopy, respiratory disease in early age, family history of asthma or chronic bronchitis, and tobacco smoke exposure.
Conclusion
The high levels of outdoor air pollution in north China are positively associated with children’s respiratory symptoms, the associations with TSP appear to be stronger than SO2 and NO2.},

Objective
To evaluate the adverse effect of exposure to air pollution on lung function growth in school-aged children.
Methods
A cohort of 1983 children from three districts in Guangzhou, China was followed-up for 6 months. The children performed pulmonary function tests twice, and their parents reported the child’s respiratory symptoms by self-administered questionnaires in both surveys.
Results
The annual mean concentrations of air pollutants for the past 5 years for particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10), nitrogen (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were respectively: 96.1 μg/m3, 76.0 μg/m3, and 65.7 μg/m3 in the highly-polluted district (HPD), 80.3 μg/m3, 67.6 μg/m3, and 54.5 μg/m3 in the moderately-polluted district (MPD), and 80.0 μg/m3, 48.1 μg/m3, and 52.2 μg/m3 in the least-polluted district (LPD). After adjustment for potential confounders, significant deficits were found in the annual growth rates of forced expiratory flows at 25% (FEF25), and between 25% and 75% (FEF25–75) in boys and FEF25 in girls (In boys, for FEF25, −0.136 l/s, p = 0.008 in MPD and −0.153 l/s, p = 0.004 in HPD, respectively; for FEF25–75, −0.176 l/s, p = 0.013 in MPD and −0.167 l/s, p = 0.021 in HPD, respectively. In girls, for FEF25, −0.123 l/s, p = 0.043 in HPD), using LPD as the reference. Deficits in the annual growth rate of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were also negatively associated with air pollution in boys (−0.063 L, p = 0.032 in HPD).
Conclusions
The study adds more evidence that exposure to air pollution has adverse effects on lung function growth in schoolchildren.},

Mean [minimum; maximum] values of the annual concentrations (μg/m3) of proximity air pollutants were respectively: 28 [18; 72.2] for NO2, 420 [350; 1337] for CO, 7.5[5; 13.7] for SO2, 23.1 [19; 51] for PM10, 8.1 [0.01; 116.6] for VOCs and 1.8 [1.5; 6.9] for benzene. Using a binary logistic regression model, PM10 were significantly associated with usual cough (Odds-Ratio=1.33 (95% confidence interval: 1.00–1.77) for exposed compared to non-exposed) and SO2 with usual cough (1.55 (1.16–2.08)) and phlegm (1.45 (1.04–2.01)). We found a 10% and a 23% increase in usual cough for a 10μg/m3 increment in PM10 and a 1μg/m3 increment in SO2 respectively, and a 23% increase in usual phlegm for a 1μg/m3 increase in SO2. A sensitivity analysis showed similar results when considering 3-year proximity pollution. A more pronounced effect of SO2 and PM10 on usual cough and phlegm was observed in woman.
Conclusions
Our assessment of exposure to proximity air pollution has shown an increased prevalence of bronchitis-like symptoms in elderly living in areas polluted by SO2 and PM10.},

The SPM samples were collected from 1999 to 2005 at two locations (urban site A and industrial site B) of Yokohama, Japan with concentrations in mean and ranges of 34.2 and 19.7–50.3μgm−3 and 22.9 and 12.7–35.1μgm−3 for the respective location. Source apportionment of SPM aerosol was conducted appropriately for the first time to these locations employing PCA-APCS technique. Major sources of SPM at site A were a) crustal source, b) urban origin, c) undefined, and d) mineral rock. At site B, the sources were predicted as a) urban origin, b) undefined, c) crustal source, and d) secondarily formed aerosol. The tracers and nature of the source related to urban origin at both sites were similar but retaining different source strength. Secondarily formed aerosol was quite unique at site B. However, mineral rock was remarkable at site A.},

A comparison of 24-h measurements revealed substantial intra-urban variability in carbonaceous aerosols consistent with the influence of local sources, and excesses in both PM2.5 organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were identified at individual sites within each city. High time-resolved black carbon (BC) measurements indicated that elemental carbon concentrations were higher at sites adjacent to freeways and busy surface streets, and temporal patterns suggested that excess EC at sites adjacent to freeways was dominated by mobile source emissions while excesses in EC away from traffic corridors was dominated by point/area source emissions. The site-to-site variability in OC concentrations was approximately 7% within the neighborhood scale (0.5–4 km) and between 4 and 27% at the urban scale (4–100 km). In contrast, measurements of organic source tracers, in conjunction with a Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) source-apportionment model, indicated that the spatial variation in the contribution of both mobile and stationary sources to PM2.5 OC often exceeded the variation in OC mass concentration by a factor of 3 or more. Markers for mobile sources, biomass smoke, natural gas, and coal combustion differed by as much as 60% within the neighborhood scale and by greater than 200% within the urban scale. The observations made during this study suggest that the urban excess of carbonaceous aerosols is much more complex than has been previously reported and that a more rigorous, source-oriented approach should be taken in order to assess the risk associated with exposure to carbonaceous aerosols within the industrialized environments of the Midwestern United States.},

   abstract = {Emissions from land transport, and from road transport in particular, have significant impacts on the atmosphere and on climate change. This assessment gives an overview of past, present and future emissions from land transport, of their impacts on the atmospheric composition and air quality, on human health and climate change and on options for mitigation. In the past vehicle exhaust emission control has successfully reduced emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. This contributed to improved air quality and reduced health impacts in industrialised countries. In developing countries however, pollutant emissions have been growing strongly, adversely affecting many populations. In addition, ozone and particulate matter change the radiative balance and hence contribute to global warming on shorter time scales. Latest knowledge on the magnitude of land transport's impact on global warming is reviewed here. In the future, road transport's emissions of these pollutants are expected to stagnate and then decrease globally. This will then help to improve the air quality notably in developing countries. On the contrary, emissions of carbon dioxide and of halocarbons from mobile air conditioners have been globally increasing and are further expected to grow. Consequently, road transport's impact on climate is gaining in importance. The expected efficiency improvements of vehicles and the introduction of biofuels will not be sufficient to offset the expected strong growth in both, passenger and freight transportation. Technical measures could offer a significant reduction potential, but strong interventions would be needed as markets do not initiate the necessary changes. Further reductions would need a resolute expansion of low-carbon fuels, a tripling of vehicle fuel efficiency and a stagnation in absolute transport volumes. Land transport will remain a key sector in climate change mitigation during the next decades.},

   abstract = {The paper introduces a new methodology for the prediction of daily PM10 concentrations, in line with the regulatory framework introduced through the EU Directive 2008/50/EC. The proposed approach is based on the efficient utilisation of the data collected over short time intervals (hourly) rather than the daily values used to derive the daily regulatory threshold. It is sufficiently simple and easily applicable in operational forecasting systems with the ability to accept as inputs both historical data and exogenous paraeters, such as meteorological variables. The application of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using data from five monitoring stations of air pollutants located in Athens, over a five year period (2000–2004) as well as compatible meteorological data from the NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Protection). A set of different models have been tested at the same time to reveal the effectiveness of the proposed approach, both univariate and multivariate, and linear and non-linear models. The analysis of all examined datasets has shown conclusive evidence that the introduction of the newly developed procedure which utilises data collected over a shorter horizon can significantly increase the forecasting ability of any developed model using daily historic PM10 data, under all examined metrics.},

   abstract = {Aerobiological studies in commuting trains in northern Taiwan were carried out from August, 2007 until July, 2008. Two six-stage (>7μm, 4.7∼7μm, 3.3∼4.7μm, 2.1∼3.3μm, 1.1∼2.1μm, 0.65∼1.1μm) cascade impactors of 400 orifices were used to collect viable bacteria and fungi, respectively. The levels of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), formaldehyde (HCHO), temperature, and relative humidity in the commuting trains were also recorded during the sampling period. Results show that bacterial concentrations ranged from 25 to 1530CFUm−3, and averaged 417CFUm−3. The fungal concentrations ranged from 45 to 1906CFUm−3, and averaged 413CFUm−3. Additionally, the highest fractions occurred in the fifth stage (1.1∼2.1μm) for both bacteria and fungi. The respirable fractions, Rb and Rf, for bacteria and fungi were 62.8% and 81.4%, respectively, which are higher than those in other studies. Furthermore, the bacterial concentration reached its highest level in autumn, and its lowest level in winter. However, the fungal concentration was highest in spring and lowest in winter. Though the total bacterial or fungal concentration did not exceed the recommendation standard in Taiwan, the relatively high respirable fraction in commuting trains probably implies a higher adverse health risk for sensitive commuters. This study further conducted multiple regression analysis to determine the relationship of various stage fractions of airborne bacteria and fungi with indoor air pollutants (CO and HCHO) and environmental parameters (CO2, temperature, and relative humidity). The correlation coefficients of multiple regression analysis for total bacteria and fungi concentrations with indoor air pollutants and environmental parameters were 0.707 (p<0.00376) and 0.612 (p<0.00471), respectively. There are currently no formally regulated laws for indoor air quality (IAQ) in Taiwan, and this preliminary study can provide references to the Taiwan government on IAQ management.},

   abstract = {Particulate pollution has been clearly linked with adverse health impacts from open fire cookstoves, and indoor air concentrations are frequently used as a proxy for exposures in health studies. Implicit are the assumptions that the size distributions for the open fire and improved stove are not significantly different, and that the relationship between indoor concentrations and personal exposures is the same between stoves. To evaluate the impact of these assumptions size distributions of particulate matter in indoor air were measured with the Sioutas cascade impactor in homes using open fires and improved Patsari stoves in a rural Purepecha community in Michoacan, Mexico. On average indoor concentrations of particles less than 0.25 μm were 72% reduced in homes with improved Patsari stoves, reflecting a reduced contribution of this size fraction to PM2.5 mass concentrations from 68% to 48%. As a result the mass median diameter of indoor PM2.5 particulate matter was increased by 29% with the Patsari improved stove compared to the open fire (from 0.42 μm to 0.59 μm, respectively). Personal PM2.5 exposure concentrations for women in homes using open fires were approximately 61% of indoor concentration levels (156 μg m−3 and 257 μg m−3 respectively). In contrast personal exposure concentrations were 77% times indoor air concentration levels for women in homes using improved Patsari stoves (78 μg m−3and 101 μg m−3 respectively). Thus, if indoor air concentrations are used in health and epidemiologic studies significant bias may result if the shift in size distribution and the change in relationship between indoor air concentrations and personal exposure concentrations are not accounted for between different stove types.},

   abstract = {Factors and sources affecting measurement uncertainty associated with monitoring metals in airborne particulate matter (PM) were investigated as part of the Windsor, Ontario Exposure Assessment Study (WOEAS). The assessment was made using co-located duplicate samples and a comparison of two analytical approaches: ED-XRF and ICP-MS. Sampling variability was estimated using relative percent difference (RPD) of co-located duplicate samples. The comparison of ICP-MS and ED-XRF results yields very good correlations (R2 ≥ 0.7) for elements present at concentrations that pass both ICP-MS and ED-XRF detection limits (e.g. Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb and Cu). PM concentration ranges (median, sample number) of 24-h indoor PM10 and personal PM10 filters, and outdoor PM2.5 filters were determined to be 2.2–40.7 (11.0, n = 48) μg m−3, 8.0–48.3 (11.9, n = 48) μg m−3, and 17.1–42.3 (21.6, n = 18) μg m−3, respectively. The gravimetric analytical results reveal that the variations in PM mass measurements for same-day sampling are insignificant compared to temporal or spatial variations: 92%, 100% and 96% of indoor, outdoor and personal duplicate samples, respectively, pass the quality criteria (RPD ≤ 20%). Uncertainties associated with ED-XRF elemental measurements of S, Ca, Mn, Fe and Zn for 24-h filter samples are low: 78%–100% of the duplicate samples passed the quality criteria. In the case of 24-h filter samples using ICP-MS, more elements passed the quality criteria due to the lower detection limits. These were: Li, Na, K, Ca, Si, Al, V, Fe, Mn, Co, Cu, Mo, Ag, Zn, Pb, As, Mg, Sb, Sn, Sr, Th, Ti, Tl, and U. Low air concentrations of metals (near or below instrumental detection limits) and/or inadvertent introduction of metal contamination are the main causes for excluding elements based on the pass/fail criteria. Uncertainty associated with elemental measurements must be assessed on an element-by-element basis.},

   abstract = {This paper presents results from an in-vehicle air quality study of public transit buses in Toledo, Ohio, involving continuous monitoring, and experimental and statistical analyses to understand in-vehicle particulate matter (PM) behavior inside buses operating on B20-grade biodiesel fuel. The study also focused on evaluating the effects of vehicle’s fuel type, operating periods, operation status, passenger counts, traffic conditions, and the seasonal and meteorological variation on particulates with aerodynamic diameter less than 1 micron (PM1.0). The study found that the average PM1.0 mass concentrations in B20-grade biodiesel-fueled bus compartments were approximately 15 μg m−3, while PM2.5 and PM10 concentration averages were approximately 19 μg m−3 and 37 μg m−3, respectively. It was also observed that average hourly concentration trends of PM1.0 and PM2.5 followed a “μ-shaped” pattern during transit hours. Experimental analyses revealed that the in-vehicle PM1.0 mass concentrations were higher inside diesel-fueled buses (10.0–71.0 μg m−3 with a mean of 31.8 μg m−3) as compared to biodiesel buses (3.3–33.5 μg m−3 with a mean of 15.3 μg m−3) when the windows were kept open. Vehicle idling conditions and open door status were found to facilitate smaller particle concentrations inside the cabin, while closed door facilitated larger particle concentrations suggesting that smaller particles were originating outside the vehicle and larger particles were formed within the cabin, potentially from passenger activity. The study also found that PM1.0 mass concentrations at the back of bus compartment (5.7–39.1 μg m−3 with a mean of 28.3 μg m−3) were higher than the concentrations in the front (5.7–25.9 μg m−3 with a mean of 21.9 μg m−3), and the mass concentrations inside the bus compartment were generally 30–70% lower than the just-outside concentrations. Further, bus route, window position, and time of day were found to affect the in-vehicle PM concentrations significantly. Overall, the in-vehicle PM1.0 concentrations inside the buses operating on B20-grade biodiesel ranged from 0.7 μg m−3 to 243 μg m−3, with a median of 11.6 μg m−3. Statistical models developed to study the effects of vehicle operation and ambient conditions on in-vehicle PM concentrations suggested that while open door status was the most important influencing variable for finer particles and higher passenger activity resulted in higher coarse particles concentrations inside the vehicle compartments, ambient PM concentrations contributed to all PM fractions inside the bus irrespective of particle size.},

The objectives were to: 1) characterize seasonal changes in indoor and outdoor levels and indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios of PAH (gas + particulate phase; dichotomized into ∑8PAHsemivolatile (MW 178–206), and ∑8PAHnonvolatile (MW 228–278)), Abs, and PM2.5; and 2) assess the relationship between PAH and ozone. Results showed that heating compared to nonheating season was associated with greater ∑8PAHnonvolatile (p<0.001) and Abs (p<0.05), and lower levels of ∑8PAHsemivolatile (p<0.001). In addition, the heating season was associated with lower I/O ratios of ∑8PAHnonvolatile and higher I/O ratios of ∑8PAHsemivolatile (p<0.001) compared to the nonheating season. In outdoor air, ∑8PAHnonvolatile was correlated negatively with community-wide ozone concentration (p<0.001).

During the first week intensive measurements were performed while test cooking fires were burned, during the second week the houses were monitored while occupied by guest families. A masonry hearth was located in the middle of each house for open cooking fires and with heating stoves. One house had a chimney leading to the outside over the hearth; in the other, a brickwork hood led the smoke into an attic and through holes in the roof. During the first week the concentration of PM2.5 averaged daily between 138 and 1650 μg m−3 inside the hearths and 21–160 μg m−3 in adjacent living rooms. CO averaged daily between 0.21 and 1.9 ppm in living areas, and up to 12 ppm in the hearths. Highest concentrations were measured when two fires were lit at the same time, which would cause high personal exposure for someone working in the kitchens. 15 min averages of up to 25 400 μg m−3 (PM2.5) and 260 ppm CO were recorded. WHO air quality guidelines were occasionally exceeded for CO and constantly for PM2.5. However, air exchange and air distribution measurements revealed a large draw in the chimney, which ensured a fast removal of wood smoke from the hearth area. The guest families were in average exposed to no more than 0.21 ppm CO during 48 h. Based on a hypothetical time-activity pattern, however, a woman living in this type of house during the 17–19th century would be exposed to daily averages of 1.1 ppm CO and 196 μg m−3 PM2.5, which exceeds WHO guideline for PM2.5, and is comparable to what is today observed for women in rural areas of developing countries.},

We investigated the cytotoxic and inflammatory activity of particulate emissions from normal (NC) and smouldering (SC) combustion in one masonry heater. The PM1–0.2 and PM0.2 samples were collected from the dilution tunnel with a high-volume cascade impactor (HVCI). Mouse RAW 264.7 macrophages were exposed to the PM-samples for 24 h. Inflammatory mediators, (IL-6, TNFα and MIP-2), and cytotoxicity (MTT-test), were measured. Furthermore, apoptosis and cell cycle of macrophages were analyzed. The HVCI particulate samples were characterized for ions, elements and PAH compounds. Assays of elemental and organic carbon were conducted from parallel low volume samples. All the samples displayed mostly dose-dependent inflammatory and cytotoxic activity. SC samples were more potent than NC samples at inducing cytotoxicity and MIP-2 production, while the order of potency was reversed in TNFα production. SC-PM1–0.2 sample was a significantly more potent inducer of apoptosis than the respective NC sample. After adjustment for the relative toxicity with emission factor (mg MJ−1), the SC-PM emissions had clearly higher inflammatory and cytotoxic potential than the NC-PM emissions. Thus, operational practice in batch burning of wood and the resultant combustion condition clearly affect the toxic potential of particulate emissions.},

   abstract = {Coal consumption is one important contributor to energy production, and is regarded as one of the most important sources of air pollutants that have considerable impacts on human health and climate change. Emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from coal combustion were studied in a typical stove. Emission factors (EFs) of 16 EPA priority PAHs from tested coals ranged from 6.25 ± 1.16 mg kg−1 (anthracite) to 253 ± 170 mg kg−1 (bituminous), with NAP and PHE dominated in gaseous and particulate phases, respectively. Size distributions of particulate phase PAHs from tested coals showed that they were mostly associated with particulate matter (PM) with size either between 0.7 and 2.1 μm or less than 0.4 μm (PM0.4). In the latter category, not only were more PAHs present in PM0.4, but also contained higher fractions of high molecular weight PAHs. Generally, there were more than 89% of total particulate phase PAHs associated with PM2.5. Gas-particle partitioning of freshly emitted PAHs from residential coal combustions were thought to be mainly controlled by absorption rather than adsorption, which is similar to those from other sources. Besides, the influence of fuel properties and combustion conditions was further investigated by using stepwise regression analysis, which indicated that almost 57 ± 10% of total variations in PAH EFs can be accounted for by moisture and volatile matter content of coal in residential combustion.},

   abstract = {More than 25 studies have employed land use regression (LUR) models to estimate nitrogen oxides and to a lesser extent particulate matter indicators, but these methods have been less commonly applied to ambient concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Some VOCs have high plausibility as sources of health effects and others are specific indicators of motor vehicle exhaust. We used LUR models to estimate spatial variability of VOCs in Toronto, Canada. Benzene, n-hexane and total hydrocarbons (THC) were measured from July 25 to August 9, 2006 at 50 locations using the TraceAir organic vapor monitors. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was also sampled to assess its spatial pattern agreement with VOC exposures. Buffers for land use, population density, traffic density, physical geography, and remote sensing measures of greenness and surface brightness were also tested. The remote sensing measures have the highest correlations with VOCs and NO2 levels (i.e., explains >36% of the variance). Our regression models explain 66–68% of the variance in the spatial distribution of VOCs, compared to 81% for the NO2 model. The ranks of agreement between various VOCs range from 48 to 63% and increases substantially – up to 75% – for the top and bottom quartile groups. Agreements between NO2 and VOCs are much smaller with an average rank of 36%. Future epidemiologic studies may therefore benefit from using VOCs as potential toxic agents for traffic-related pollutants.},

   abstract = {During the June 1996 eruption of Mt Ruapehu, New Zealand, traces of fine particulate volcanic ash were observed in or near the cities of Hamilton and Auckland, 166–282 km from the volcano. Although no health impacts in these cities were attributed to the eruption, hospital records at both cities for the following month show the highest rates of respiratory mortality for the 1990s. Alternative explanations for this increase in respiratory mortality were investigated, including urban air pollution, adverse weather conditions and influenza. Comparable records from Wellington city, assumed to be outside the zone of ash dispersal, were used as a ‘control’. Our results suggest that at Hamilton, where non-volcanic factors can largely be eliminated as making a significant contribution, diffuse volcanic ashfall may have been an important factor in respiratory mortality during the weeks following the eruption. At Auckland, further away from the volcano but with a much larger population than Hamilton, a case for a weaker volcanic contribution can be made, but is more equivocal because of coincidentally high urban air pollution and cold, stable weather. These findings support the concept that diffuse fine volcanic ash poses a risk to respiratory health at greater distances from an eruption than is currently perceived. This is because the finest ‘respirable’ fraction of erupted material with potentially hazardous physico-chemical properties is likely to be ejected highest into the atmosphere and dispersed the greatest distance. If significant amounts reach large cities, then large numbers of individuals may be at risk, especially those already suffering poor respiratory health. This work has important implications for environmental health and hazard management in New Zealand and in other regions that may be susceptible to a similar volcanic threat.},

   abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests that short episodes of high exposure to air pollution occur while commuting. These events can result in potentially adverse health effects. We present a quantification of the exposure of car passengers and cyclists to particulate matter (PM). We have simultaneously measured concentrations (PNC, PM2.5 and PM10) and ventilatory parameters (minute ventilation (VE), breathing frequency and tidal volume) in three Belgian locations (Brussels, Louvain-la-Neuve and Mol) for 55 persons (38 male and 17 female). Subjects were first driven by car and then cycled along identical routes in a pairwise design. Concentrations and lung deposition of PNC and PM mass were compared between biking trips and car trips. Mean bicycle/car ratios for PNC and PM are close to 1 and rarely significant. The size and magnitude of the differences in concentrations depend on the location which confirms similar inconsistencies reported in literature. On the other hand, the results from this study demonstrate that bicycle/car differences for inhaled quantities and lung deposited dose are large and consistent across locations. These differences are caused by increased VE in cyclists which significantly increases their exposure to traffic exhaust. The VE while riding a bicycle is 4.3 times higher compared to car passengers. This aspect has been ignored or severely underestimated in previous studies. Integrated health risk evaluations of transport modes or cycling policies should therefore use exposure estimates rather than concentrations.},

   abstract = {In Brazil, sugar-cane crops are burned to facilitate harvesting, and this causes environmental pollution from the large amounts of smoke and soot that are released into the atmosphere. The smoke and soot contain numerous organic compounds such as PAHs. In this study, PM10 and PAH concentrations in the air of Araraquara (SE Brazil, with around 200,000 inhabitants and surrounded by sugar-cane plantations) were determined during the harvest and non-harvest seasons. The sampling strategy included two campaigns in each season, with 20 samples per season. PM10 was collected using a Hi-vol sampler with Teflon™ – coated glass fiber filters. PM10 ranged from 41 to 181 μg m−3 during the harvest season, and from 12 to 47 μg m−3 during the non-harvest season. The mean total concentration of PAHs was 2.5 ng m−3 (non-harvest season) and 11.6 ng m−3 (harvest season). In all sampling periods, the most abundant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were phenanthrene and fluoranthrene, and the least abundant was anthracene. The cluster analysis of the total PAH concentrations for each day of sampling and the corresponding meteorological data suggested that the atmospheric concentration of PAHs was independent of the differences in the weather between the seasons. For both sampling seasons, the statistical treatment (PCA, Varimax rotation and HCA) indicated the presence of vehicle sources (diesel, gasoline, and natural-gas engines); but for the harvest season, the main source was attributed to sugar-cane burning. The data generated by this study indicated the burning of sugar-cane as the main contributor to the high levels of PAHs detected in samples during the sugar-cane harvest season.},

   abstract = {This research evaluates commuter exposure to particulate matter during pre-journey commute segments for passengers waiting at bus stops by investigating 840 min of simultaneous exposure levels, both inside and outside seven bus shelters in Buffalo, New York. A multivariate regression model is used to estimate the relation between exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5 measured in μg m−3) and three vectors of determinants: time and location, physical setting and placement, and environmental factors. Four determinants have a statistically significant effect on particulate matter: time of day, passengers’ waiting location, land use near the bus shelter, and the presence of cigarette smoking at the bus shelter. Model results suggest that exposure to PM2.5 inside a bus shelter is 2.63 μg m−3 (or 18 percent) higher than exposure outside a bus shelter, perhaps due in part to the presence of cigarette smoking. Morning exposure levels are 6.51 μg m−3 (or 52 percent) higher than afternoon levels. Placement of bus stops can affect exposure to particulate matter for those waiting inside and outside of shelters: air samples at bus shelters located in building canyons have higher particulate matter than bus shelters located near open space.},

   abstract = {This study evaluates the health risks in megacities in terms of mortality and morbidity due to air pollution. A new spreadsheet model, Risk of Mortality/Morbidity due to Air Pollution (Ri-MAP), is used to estimate the excess numbers of deaths and illnesses. By adopting the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline concentrations for the air pollutants SO2, NO2 and total suspended particles (TSP), concentration-response relationships and a population attributable-risk proportion concept are employed. Results suggest that some megacities like Los Angeles, New York, Osaka Kobe, Sao Paulo and Tokyo have very low excess cases in total mortality from these pollutants. In contrast, the approximate numbers of cases is highest in Karachi (15,000/yr) characterized by a very high concentration of total TSP (∼670μgm−3). Dhaka (7000/yr), Beijing (5500/yr), Karachi (5200/yr), Cairo (5000/yr) and Delhi (3500/yr) rank highest with cardiovascular mortality. The morbidity (hospital admissions) due to Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) follows the tendency of cardiovascular mortality. Dhaka and Karachi lead the rankings, having about 2100/yr excess cases, while Osaka-Kobe (∼20/yr) and Sao Paulo (∼50/yr) are at the low end of all megacities considered. Since air pollution is increasing in many megacities, and our database of measured pollutants is limited to the period up to 2000 and does not include all relevant components (e.g. O3), these numbers should be interpreted as lower limits. South Asian megacities most urgently need improvement of air quality to prevent excess mortality and morbidity due to exceptionally high levels of air pollution. The risk estimates obtained from Ri-MAP present a realistic baseline evaluation for the consequences of ambient air pollution in comparison to simple air quality indices, and can be expanded and improved in parallel with the development of air pollution monitoring networks.},

In order to address the air pollution problems, this paper seeks to analyse the individual contributions of major sulphur dioxide (SO2) sources in the Pearl River Delta Region (PRDR) (Pearl River Delta + HKSAR) on the air quality in the HKSAR. This study employed the coupling of the MM5/CALMET system with the CALPUFF, the multi-layer, non-steady-state puff dispersion model, where major power plants, marine vessels and vehicles, all in the PRDR, are taken into account. The observation data and simulation results at 11 Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department (HKEPD) general (non-road-side) stations are analyzed. Urban (in-zone) and Rural (out-zone) stations are defined in order to examine the SO2 contribution of different emission sources in different regions of the HKSAR. The model results show that the contribution of the HKSAR marine sources is significant both in summer and in winter, especially for the locations around the in-zone stations (in general 60%, and 55% in summer and winter respectively). In addition, the contribution of the HKSAR power plants is slightly higher than that of the PRD power plants in early summer, with a contribution difference of up to 20% when the prevailing wind is from the south. However, in late summer, this situation reverses. In winter, the contribution of the PRD power plants is two to three times greater than that of the HKSAR power plants. Moreover, Yantian port affects the northern part of the HKSAR when a northeasterly wind dominates the HKSAR. In order to solve these air pollution problems, the main implication of these results suggests that the HKSAR government, in close co-operation with the Guangdong government, needs to take immediate action.},

Meteorological conditions were described by the Hess and Brezowsky synoptic weather classification system and gridded data of the EU FP6 ENSEMBLES project of total precipitation and mean surface temperature. DAQx values indicate sufficient to poor air quality in the urban area of Brussels and at urban traffic stations, as well as satisfactory air quality at the background stations. The air quality index refers to more than 90% to the presence of high PM10, O3 and NO2 concentrations. SO2 and CO play only a minor role. The investigation of weather regimes indicates that zonal and mixed cyclonic circulation regimes are associated with better air quality than meridional and anticyclonic weather regimes. In general, weather regimes with high daily precipitation lead to better air quality than dryer air masses because of lower contribution of PM10 to the air quality index. A trend analysis of weather regimes from 1978 to 2007 shows significant (α=0.05) positive trends for weather classes associated with lower PM10 concentrations. The results of a case study at a German station examining the relationship between PM10 concentrations and local meteorological quantities (wind speed and precipitation) confirm the results of the regional analysis.},

In diurnal cycle, highest PM concentrations were observed during weekday’s peak hour traffic and lowest PM concentrations were found during trickle traffic (afternoon and nighttime). The seasonal PM data analysis showed highest concentrations during post monsoon season (PM10 = 189, PM2.5 = 84, PM1 = 66μg/m3) compared to winter (PM10 = 135, PM2.5 = 73, PM1 = 59μg/m3) and summer (PM10 = 102, PM2.5 = 50, PM1 = 34μg/m3) seasons. The particle size distribution during post-monsoon, winter and summer seasons showed two distinct modes viz. accumulation (mean diameter, d = 2.2μm; distribution = 40%) and coarse (d = 7.1μm, distribution = 60%). The frequency distribution of PM10 concentrations during post–monsoon and winter seasons indicated that the PM10 values at the study site fall under moderate to poor categories. During post–monsoon and winter seasons, it was found that more than 50% of the time the 24–h average PM10 concentrations were violating the Indian national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) (100μg/m3) and world health organization (WHO) standard (50μg/m3).

   abstract = {Since 2006, a team of forecasters in Georgia (USA) has been using the high–resolution air quality forecasting system (Hi–Res) as an aid for making ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) forecasts. Here, we examine Hi–Res’s O3 and PM2.5 forecasting performance for the Atlanta metropolitan area during the summers of 2006–2009. A classificatory evaluation approach was adopted. The spatial synoptic classification (SSC) calendar for Atlanta was used to cluster the forecasting days into typical summer weather types of dry moderate, dry tropical, moist moderate, moist tropical, and a transition class. The forecasting days were also classified according to emissions conditions as special weekdays (Monday and Friday), typical weekdays and weekends/holidays. Evaluation of forecasts during 2006– 2009 shows that O3 performance was worse on moist days and better on dry days. This is an important concern for forecasters since a sizeable number of days that exceeded the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for O3 were observed under moist tropical weather type during the period. On the other hand, PM2.5 performance during 2006–2008 was opposite – worse on dry days, especially on dry tropical days, and better on moist days. This too is a concern since higher concentrations of PM2.5 were observed to occur on dry days. In 2009, PM2.5 forecasting performance on dry days was improved significantly by integrating a new secondary organic aerosol (SOA) module into the system. As a result, the differences in PM2.5 forecasting performance between dry and moist days were diminished. Other results of this study, suggest that a relatively larger forecasting error on weekends/holidays may be due to higher uncertainties in emission estimates on those days. To a lesser extent, this was also true on special weekdays because of the greater variations in rush hour emissions relative to typical weekdays.},

   abstract = {In response to the need to further explore and understand the technical needs and challenges presented by implementing a multi–pollutant, risk–based approach to air quality management, a case study was performed for the urban area of Detroit. As part of this case study, two contrasting air quality control strategies were assessed and compared. One strategy mimicked the “status quo”, where controls were selected separately to address ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) nonattainment at monitor locations, while the other strategy reflected a “multi– pollutant, risk–based” approach aimed at further reducing population risk from exposure to ozone, PM2.5 and selected air toxics while still addressing ozone and PM2.5 nonattainment. This paper describes the technical framework used to apply and evaluate the two contrasting air quality control strategies and describes the relative benefits of each. Based on this case study, we found that the “multi–pollutant, risk–based” approach was able to: (1) achieve the same or greater reductions of PM2.5 and O3 at monitors; (2) improve air quality regionally and across the Detroit urban core for multiple pollutants; (3) produce approximately two times greater monetized benefits for PM2.5 and O3; (4) reduce non–cancer risk; and (5) result in greater net benefits and be more cost effective.},

   abstract = {The emission characteristics of airborne PM10 in the Sihwa and Banwol Industrial Complex Area of Korea are highly complicated because of diverse man-made activities (about 4000 stacks). The measurements of 16 metals were undertaken using collision cell technology-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (CCT-ICP-MS) from two industrial sites and one reference site in the vicinity of a residential area. Based on our measurements, we attempted to characterize the pollution status of PM10 and metals in the study area. The spatial differences in the PM10 and metal levels were significant except for the crustal and marine derived metals. Temporal variations in the PM10 and most metal data were fairly distinct so that their highest concentrations generally occur in the fall or spring, while the lowest in the summer. The daily concentrations of most metals and PM10 showed strong or moderate correlations among the three sites; however, results of conditional probability function (CPF) obviously accounted for the influences of industrial activities. Thus, concentrations of airborne PM10 and anthropogenic metals in residential area adjacent to Sihwa and Banwol (S/B) industrial areas were tightly affected by industrial activities.},

   abstract = {The elemental composition data of ambient aerosols collected upon selected wind sectors in the highly industrialised harbour of Dunkirk (France) were interpreted using pollution roses, elemental ratios, Enrichment Factors (EF), Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor model. The objective was to identify the possible sources of PM10 aerosols, their respective chemical tracers and to determine their relative contribution at the sampling site. PM10 particles samples were collected from June 2003 to March 2005 in order to analyse up to 35 elements (Ag, Al, As, Ba, Bi, Ca, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Eu, Fe, K, La, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Ni, Pb, Rb, S, Sb, Sc, Si, Sm, Sr, Th, Ti, U, V, Zn and Zr) using Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP)-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (AES) and ICP-Mass Spectrometry (MS). A significant effort has been made on estimating the total uncertainty of each result by regularly analysing blanks, quality controls and SRM NIST standards. Based on this procedure, a selected set of 24 "robust" elements was compared to the 35-element matrix in order to evaluate the sturdiness of our PMF statistical treatment. Eight source factors were resolved by PCA for all the wind sectors explaining 90% of the total data variance. The PMF results confirmed that eight physically interpretable factors contributed to the ambient particulate pollution at the sampling site: crustal dust (11%), marine aerosols (12%), petrochemistry activities (9.2%), metallurgical sintering plant (8.6%), metallurgical coke plant (12.6%), ferromanganese plant (6.6%), road transport (15%) and a less clearly interpretable profile probably associated to dust resuspension (13%). These weighted contributions against wind direction frequencies demonstrate that industrial sources are the most important contributors to this site (37%) followed by the natural sources (detrital and marine sources) (23%) and the road transport (15%).},

Positive matrix factorization (PMF) and conditional probability function (CPF) were applied to these PM data sets to identify the diverse sources in the industrial area. A total of nine source types were identified to be important which include: secondary aerosol, cement/construction, soil dust, road dust, vehicle exhaust, incineration/Pb-related industry, metal smelting, fossil fuel combustion, and field burning. Results of our study suggest that there are competing relationships between anthropogenic and natural source processes in this industrial area.},

   abstract = {Few studies have been conducted on the relationship between the high levels of dust particles and the concentrations of atmospheric PCDD/F during dust storm episodes. However, they did not investigate the impact of dust storm on basin areas. This present study shows the dust storm effect on regulated harmful matter and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin/dibenzofuran (PCDD/F) concentrations in basin areas. The results indicate that the average PM10 (aerodynamic diameter less than 10μm), SO2 (sulfur dioxide), NO2 (nitrogen oxides), CO (carbon monoxide) and O3 (ozone) levels during the dust storm were 5.14, 2.30, 1.44, 1.40 and 1.41 times higher than those before the dust storm, respectively. Mean PCDD/F concentrations during the dust storm (0.958pgNm−3; 0.0484pgI-TEQNm−3) were significantly higher than those before the dust storm (0.240pgNm−3; 0.00705pgI-TEQNm−3). The PCDDs concentration during the dust storm was 1.84 times larger than that before the dust storm, and the PCDFs concentration was 10.2 times larger. Therefore, the dominant contribution of PCDD/Fs concentration during dust storm in the basin areas of northern Taiwan is PCDFs. OCDD concentration measured before dust storm was the highest among the seventeen investigated PCDD/F congeners, accounting for about 64.6% of the total concentration. However, OCDD concentration measured during the dust storm was comparable with the OCDF among the seventeen investigated PCDD/F congeners, accounting for about 24.5% (OCDD) and 22.9% (OCDF) of the total concentration. The above results indicate that the impact of a dust storm on regulated harmful matter and PCDD/F concentrations in the basin area is significant. An investigation of the health risk from dust storms in basin areas is needed.},

Suspended particulate matters in the form of respirable (PM10) aerosols were collected on the roof of a three storied building at a height of 20m above the ground, at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai using Hi-Volume Sampler (HVS) with Whatman glass fiber filter paper during the period of March–June 2009. The sequence of solubility of ions in both extractants (acid+water) of PM10 aerosols from greatest to least was found to be Na+>Ca++>K+>Cl−>F−>Mg++>NO3−≈SO4−−. The average concentration of Na+, K+, Mg++, Ca++, F−, Cl−, NO3− and SO4−− in PM10 aerosols was estimated to be 13.36g/kg, 3.76g/kg,0.251g/kg,3.771g/kg,0.833g/kg,1.17g/kg, 81μg/kg and 290μg/kg respectively. The enrichment of particular ion in soluble components may be due to its high abundance in PM10 aerosols, less sorptivity with the tiny solid particles of atmospheric dust, high extractability and leachability, high solubility and mobility. By classifying the PM10 aerosols into two categories viz fine particle (<2.5μm) and coarse particle (>2.5μm–<10μm), it was found that generally, in the fine particle, the geometric mean concentration of total soluble ions in acid and water components was found to be higher than coarse particle. Overall, it was also observed that generally as particle size increases, the geometric mean concentration of soluble ions in both extractants of PM10 aerosols decreases.},

   abstract = {Samples of PM2.5, PM10, and TSP from 2001 to 2003 have been collected in Beijing during spring (low-dust), spring (high dust), summer and winter. The concentration of TSP, PM10, and PM2.5 was most abundant in spring with high dust followed by winter, spring with little dust and summer. The average mass ratios of PM>10, PM2.5–10 and PM2.5 to TSP show that the large coarse fraction (PM>10) and the fine fraction (PM2.5) contribute most in spring with high dust while PM2.5, PM2.5–10, and PM>10 contributed similar fractions to TSP in summer and PM2.5 in winter. Sixteen cascade impaction samples were collected for elemental analysis in 2000 and 2001 and 16 major components were analyzed by PIXE. Based on the characteristics of the size distribution, three different patterns are observed: coarse mode, fine mode and bimodal mode. Different groups showed different characteristics. Crustal elements showed stable size shapes between different seasons, however, pollution elements showed complex and more variations, and the size distribution showed tendency to vary between unimodal fine modes and bimodal modes. Additionally, the concentration of aerosols and the temporal variation of the elements varied significantly according to different meteorological conditions especially on haze–fog weather conditions. Different elements showed different size distributions on haze–fog weather, i.e. crustal elements of Al, Si, Ca showed similar variation with those average days, pollution elements of S, As, Zn showed significantly higher level than those average values but mixed elements of K, Mn, Cu, Pb showed not so higher than those pollution elements. The high S in haze–fog weather was most from water soluble sulfate parts, the bimodal modes of elements showed unimodal variation and the peak of accumulation modes showed tendency variation to the larger sizes in haze–fog weather. However, most crustal elements showed not much increase during haze–fog condition, which is consistent to other researches. Most of the elements in coarse fractions showed higher concentrations in the nighttime than those in the daytime. In addition, most peaks of accumulation modes showed higher in daytime than those in nighttime, and/or showed tendency to increase to larger sizes. Taking into account the properties of aerosols coming from different sources in the winter, the direction from which air masses are transported affects the characteristics of the particles, i.e. cleaner air from the northwest and more polluted air from the south. There were also similar variations in potassium and manganese, indicating waste incineration as a common source.},

   abstract = {Air Pollution control is of major concern for the Greater Athens Area (GAA) of Greece. High concentrations of Particulate Matter with diameter less than 10μm (PM10) have been observed and often reported to exceed the currently EU legislated 24-hour limit of 50μg/m3. Efforts therefore have been placed on understanding the PM10 concentration pattern in the area so that mitigation measures can be taken accordingly. The present paper presents a statistical methodology to discover causal relationships between daily PM10 exceedances at a monitoring site, with PM10 concentrations from existing stations from the monitoring network and associated weather patterns. The proposed approach utilised a dimension reduction algorithm, Positive Matrix Factorisation (PMF) algorithm, coupled with the k-means clustering algorithm to identify distinct groups of data. Then for each resulted cluster, the Granger Causality method aided by the Pearson correlation is applied to establish the causal relationships between the meteorological patterns and the observed PM10 exceedances. The study was conducted using 6-years of daily PM10 concentration data from the monitoring network in the GAA, complemented with meteorological data available from the National Centres for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecasting System (GFS). The analysis yielded that the PM10 exceedances in the Athens area can be classified into 6 distinct types identified with varying spatial distribution characteristics and air pollution contributors.},

Na primeira parte se estabelecem algumas conexões teóricas gerais entre as teses de Arendt a respeito da crise da educação e sua reflexão filosófico-política sobre a crise política da modernidade. Na segunda parte do texto, discute-se a hipótese arendtiana de que a crise da educação também está relacionada à introdução de abordagens educacionais de caráter psicopedagógico, as quais, em vez contribuir para educar os jovens para a responsabilidade pelo mundo e para a ação política, os mantêm numa condição infantilizada que se estende até a idade adulta, trazendo, em consequência, novos problemas políticos. Finalmente, na terceira parte do texto, propõe-se a hipótese de que uma das principais contribuições do pensamento arendtiano para pensar a crise contemporânea da educação se encontra em sua interessante discussão do binômio "crítica" e "crise", o qual põe em questão o binômio tradicional "crise/reforma". Arendt, assim como Foucault e Deleuze, nos ensina que crítica e crise são fenômenos modernos indissociáveis e nos convida a enxergar a crise como momento privilegiado para o exercício da atividade da crítica. Para Arendt, a crise na educação deve ser entendida como oportunidade crucial para reflexões críticas a respeito do próprio processo educativo.</p>},

While it has brought great benefits to crop production, it has also resulted in contamination to ecosystem. In this study, we investigated accumulation of chlorotoluron (Chl) and biological responses of wheat plants as affected by dissolved organic matter (DOM). Wheat seedlings grown under 10 mg kg−1 Chl for 4 d showed a low level of chlorophyll accumulation and damage to plasma membrane. The growth was inhibited by exposure of chlorotoluron. Treatment with 50 mg DOC kg−1 DOM derived either from sludge (DOM-SL) or straw (DOM-ST) attenuated the chlorotoluron toxicity to plants. Both DOMs decreased activities of catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in Chl-treated seedlings. However, an increased glutathione S-transferases activity was observed under the same condition. Wheat plants treated with Chl in the presence of DOM accumulated less Chl than those treated with Chl alone. Moreover, in the presence of DOM, bioconcentration factor (BCF) decreased whereas translocation factors increased. Analyses with FT-IR spectra confirmed the regulatory role of DOMs in reducing Chl accumulation in wheat.},

Additionally, catalase and superoxide dismutase were up-regulated in the digestive gland indicating oxidative stress. In all treated mussels a significant up-regulation of heat shock protein mRNA was observed in gills after four days, which suggests protein damage and the requirement for repair processes.

To investigate the potential for health effects of exposure at these levels, we conducted a pilot study of subway workers comparing personal exposures to steel dust with biomarkers of metal exposure, oxidative stress, and DNA damage in blood and urine samples. Workers wore a personal air sampler operating at 4L/m for one to three work shifts with blood and urine samples collected at the end of the final shift. We found that PM2.5 exposures varied among subway workers on the basis of job title and job activity. The subway workers’ mean time-weighted PM2.5 exposure was 52μg/m3, with a median of 27μg/m3, and a range of 6–469μg/m3. The observed concentrations of PM2.5, iron, manganese, and chromium fell well below occupational standards. Biomarker concentrations among the 39 subway workers were compared with a group of 11 bus drivers, and a group of 25 suburban office workers. Concentrations of DNA–protein crosslinks and chromium in plasma were significantly higher in subway workers than in bus drivers, but no significant difference was observed for these biomarkers between subway workers and office workers. Urinary isoprostane concentrations were significantly correlated with the number of years working in the subway system, and were detected at higher, though not significantly higher, concentrations in subway workers than in bus drivers or office workers. At the group level, there was no consistent pattern of biomarker concentrations among subway workers significantly exceeding those of the bus drivers and office workers.

   abstract = {By multilayer spiral low-dose computed tomography (LD-CT) of the chest this study assesses the early detection of lung lesions on a sample of 100 traffic policemen of a big Italian city professionally exposed to urban pollutants and 100 controls non-occupationally exposed to urban pollutants matched by sex, age, length of service and cigarette smoking habit. Exposure to urban pollutants in traffic policemen was characterized using the annual average concentrations of PM10, NO2 and benzene in the period 1998–2008 measured by fixed monitoring stations located in different areas of the city. A significant and increasing number of suspicious lung nodules with diameters between 5 and 10mm was observed: in traffic policemen (including smokers and non-smokers) vs. controls (including smokers and non-smokers); in total smokers (including traffic policemen and controls) vs. total non-smokers (traffic policemen and controls); in smoker traffic policemen vs. smoker controls and vs. non-smoker traffic policemen; in non-smoker traffic policemen vs. non-smoker controls. The RR of finding cases with at least one lung nodule with diameters between 5 and 10mm in traffic policemen (including smokers and non-smokers) compared to controls (including smokers and non-smokers) is 1.94 (CI 1.13–3.31); in total smokers vs. non-smokers the RR is 1.96 (CI 1.20–3.19). The comparison between the interaction exposure and smoking shows an increase in smoker traffic policemen than in smoker controls (RR=2.14; CI 1.02–4.52). The RR for smoker traffic policemen was higher than in non-smoker traffic policemen (RR=2.09; CI 1.19–3.66). The results of our study show that: (1) while smoker workers have a higher risk for developing solid suspicious lung nodules, the simple routinely exposure to urban pollutants is unable to produce the same kind of increased risk; (2) the interaction of smoking and exposure to urban pollutants greatly increases the risk for the development of solid suspicious lung nodules. In conclusion, the use of chest LD-CT in workers at risk helps identify suspicious solid lung nodules at early stage.},

To describe second-hand smoke in the hospitals of the Catalan Network for Smoke-free Hospitals using Particulate Matter (PM2.5) and to assess the association between second-hand smoke exposure in main entrances (outdoors) and halls and between PM2.5 and airborne nicotine concentrations.
Methods
Cross-sectional study carried out in 2009 in the 53 hospitals affiliated with the network. We measured PM2.5 (μg/m3) in all hospitals and measured airborne nicotine concentrations (μg/m3) in a subsample of 11 hospitals. For each assessment, we measured nine locations within the hospitals, computing medians, means, geometric means, interquartile ranges (IQRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the means and the geometric means. Further, we used Spearman’s linear correlation coefficient rsp) to explore the association between PM2.5 concentrations in halls and main entrances and between PM2.5 and nicotine concentrations.
Results
The overall median of the 429 PM2.5 measurements was 12.48μg/m3 (IQR: 8.84–19.76μg/m3). The most exposed locations were outdoor smoking points (16.64μg/m3), cafeterias (14.82μg/m3), and main entrances (14.04μg/m3); dressing rooms were the least exposed (6.76μg/m3). PM2.5 concentrations in halls were positively correlated with those in main entrances (rsp=0.591, 95% CI: 0.377–0.745), as were PM2.5 values and nicotine concentrations (rsp=0.644, 95% CI: 0.357–0.820).
Conclusions
Second-hand smoke levels in hospitals were low in most locations, with the highest levels observed in outdoor locations where smoking is allowed (smoking points and entrances). Smoking in main entrances was associated with increased second-hand smoke levels in halls. Use of PM2.5 to evaluate second-hand smoke is feasible and shows a good correlation with airborne nicotine values.},

   abstract = {Sulfur dioxide (SO2) has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity, but only few studies were conducted in Asian countries. Previous studies suggest that SO2 may have adverse health effects independent of other pollutants. In the Public Health and Air Pollution in Asia (PAPA) project, the short-term associations between ambient sulfur dioxide (SO2) and daily mortality were examined in Bangkok, Thailand, and three Chinese cities: Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Wuhan. Poisson regression models incorporating natural spline smoothing functions were used to adjust for seasonality and other time-varying covariates. Effect estimates were obtained for each city and then for the cities combined. The impact of alternative model specifications, such as lag structure of pollutants and degree of freedom (df) for time trend, on the estimated effects of SO2 were also examined. In both individual-city and combined analysis, significant effects of SO2 on total non-accidental and cardiopulmonary mortality were observed. An increase of 10μg/m3 of 2-day moving average concentrations of SO2 corresponded to 1.00% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75–1.24], 1.09% (95% CI, 0.71–1.47), and 1.47% (95% CI, 0.85–2.08) increase of total, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, respectively, in the combined analysis. Sensitivity analyzes suggested that these findings were generally insensitive to alternative model specifications. After adjustment for PM10 or O3, the effect of SO2 remained significant in three Chinese cities. However, adjustment for NO2 diminished the associations and rendered them statistically insignificant in all four cities. In conclusion, ambient SO2 concentration was associated with daily mortality in these four Asian cities. These associations may be attributable to SO2 serving as a surrogate of other substances. Our findings suggest that the role of outdoor exposure to SO2 should be investigated further in this region.},

   abstract = {Indoor air pollution from solid fuel use is a significant risk factor for acute lower respiratory infections among children in sub-Saharan Africa. Interventions that promote a switch to modern fuels hold a large health promise, but their effective design and implementation require an understanding of the web of upstream and proximal determinants of household fuel use. Using Demographic and Health Survey data for Benin, Kenya and Ethiopia together with Bayesian hierarchical and spatial modelling, this paper quantifies the impact of household-level factors on cooking fuel choice, assesses variation between communities and districts and discusses the likely nature of contextual effects. Household- and area-level characteristics appear to interact as determinants of cooking fuel choice. In all three countries, wealth and the educational attainment of women and men emerge as important; the nature of area-level factors varies between countries. In Benin, a two-level model with spatial community random effects best explains the data, pointing to an environmental explanation. In Ethiopia and Kenya, a three-level model with unstructured community and district random effects is selected, implying relatively autonomous economic and social areas. Area-level heterogeneity, indicated by large median odds ratios, appears to be responsible for a greater share of variation in the data than household-level factors. This may be an indication that fuel choice is to a considerable extent supply-driven rather than demand-driven. Consequently, interventions to promote fuel switching will carefully need to assess supply-side limitations and devise appropriate policy and programmatic approaches to overcome them. To our knowledge, this paper represents the first attempt to model the determinants of solid fuel use, highlighting socio-economic differences between households and, notably, the dramatic influence of contextual effects. It illustrates the potential that multilevel and spatial modelling approaches hold for understanding determinants of major public health problems in the developing world.},

   abstract = {Temperature inversions result in the accumulation of air pollution, often to levels exceeding air quality criteria. The respiratory response may be detectable in sputum cell counts. This study investigates the effect of boundary layer temperature inversions on sputum cell counts. Total and differential cell counts of neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages and lymphocytes were quantified in sputum samples of patients attending an outpatient clinic. Temperature inversions were identified using data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, an atmospheric sensor on the Aqua spacecraft which was launched in 2002 by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. On inversion days, a statistically significant increase in the percent of cells that were neutrophils was observed in stable patients. There was also a statistically significant increase in the percent of cells that were macrophages, in exacerbated patients. Multivariate linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between temperature inversions and cell counts, controlling patients’ age, smoking status, medications and meteorological variables of temperature and humidity. The analyses indicate that, in the stable and exacerbated groups, percent neutrophils and macrophages increased by 12.6% and 2.5%, respectively, on inversion days. These results suggest that temperature inversions need consideration as an exacerbating factor in bronchitis and obstructive airway disease. The effects of air pollutants, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, fine particulate matter and ozone, were investigated. We identified no significant associations with any pollutant. However, we found that monthly averages of total cell counts were strongly correlated with monthly nitrogen dioxide concentrations, an association not previously identified in the literature.},

   abstract = {Several studies have demonstrated that millions of people globally are potentially exposed to volcanic gases. Hydrogen sulfide is a typical gas in volcanic and geothermal areas. The gas is toxic at high concentrations that predominantly affects the nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems. The WHO air quality guideline for hydrogen sulfide is 150μgm−3 (105ppb). The northwest part of Taipei is surrounded by sulfur-rich geothermal and hot springs. Active fumaroles and bubbling springs around the geothermal area emit acidic gases. In combination with automobile emissions, the pollution of acid aerosols is characteristic of the metropolis. This study considered sulfur-rich geothermal, suburban and downtown locations of this metropolis to evaluate geothermally emitted acid aerosol and H2S pollution. Acid aerosols were collected using a honeycomb denuder filter pack sampling system (HDS), and then analyzed by ion chromatography (IC). Results indicated that long-term geothermal emissions, automobile emissions and photochemical reactions have led to significant variations in air pollution among regions of metropolitan Taipei. The highest H2S concentration was 1705ppb in the geothermal area with low traffic density and the mean concentration was 404.06ppb, which was higher than WHO guideline and might cause eye irritation. The SO2 concentrations were relatively low (mean concentration was 3.9ppb) in this area. It may partially result from the chemical reduction reaction in the geothermal emission, which converted the SO2 gas into SO42− and H2S. Consequently, very high sulfate concentrations (mean concentration higher than 25.0μgm−3) were also observed in the area. The geothermal areas also emitted relatively high levels of aerosol acidity, Cl−, F−, PO43−, and N-containing aerosols. As a result, concentrations of HNO3, NO2−, PO43−, and SO42− in metropolitan Taipei are significantly higher than those in other urban areas considered in other studies. These results provide evidence that geothermal emissions represent a significant source of acid aerosols in metropolitan Taipei. Therefore, in this metropolitan area, the combined health effects of air pollutants from automobiles and geothermal emissions should be particular concern.},

Although environmental conditions may play role, information on the effects of air pollution exposure in this population is lacking. The present study was conducted in Athens, Greece, in order to investigate the adverse effects of long-term air pollution exposure on respiratory outcomes in mail carriers. A total of 226 mail carriers and 73 office employees were enroled. Information on respiratory symptoms, medical, occupational, residential and smoking history was obtained through a questionnaire. Flow-volume curves were performed in the workplace using a portable spirometer. Individualised personal exposure assessment has been applied based on long-term residential and occupational subject history linked with geographical air pollution distribution. Furthermore, personal measurements were obtained for forty-one mail carriers using NO2 and O3 passive samplers, assuming that current air pollution exposure is sufficiently representative of long-term, previous exposure to make a plausible link with current health status. The analysis based on exposures estimated on the basis of residential and work addresses showed that the most exposed to PM10 postal workers have rhinitis at a higher rate (OR=1.67, 95% CI: 1.01–2.75). In mail carriers there is indication that those exposed to higher concentrations of Ο3 or PM10 have a greater possibility to present rhinitis (OR=1.63, 95% CI: 0.93–2.88 and OR=1.70, 95% CI: 0.96–3.03, respectively). The effect of O3 on rhinitis became even more apparent in the analysis based on exposures assessed by personal measurements (OR=6.74, 95% CI: 1.24–36.55). Exposure to NO2 was significantly associated with decrements in lung function. For office employees the exposure to air pollutants was not associated to any adverse respiratory outcome. Our findings suggest that air pollution is a contributing factor for the occurrence of rhinitis and lung function impairment in mail carriers.},

We assessed the short-term mortality effects of daily loss of visibility. During 1996–2006, we obtained mortality data for non-accidental and cardiorespiratory causes, visibility recorded as visual range in kilometers, temperature, and relative humidity from an urban observatory, and concentrations of four criteria pollutants. A generalized additive Poisson regression model with penalized cubic regression splines was fitted to control for time variant covariates. For non-accidental mortality, an interquartile range (IQR) of 6.5km decrease in visibility at lag0–1 days was associated with an excess risk (ER%) [95% CI] of 1.13 [0.49, 1.76] for all ages and 1.37 [0.65, 2.09] for ages 65 years and over; for cardiovascular mortality of 1.31 [0.13, 2.49] for all ages, and 1.72 [0.44, 3.00] for ages 65 years and over; and for respiratory mortality of 1.92 [0.49, 3.35] for all ages and 1.76 [0.28, 3.25] for ages 65 years and over. The estimated ER% for daily mortality derived from both visibility and air pollutant data were comparable in terms of magnitude, lag pattern, and exposure–response relationships especially when using particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10μm to predict the mortality associated with visibility. Visibility provides a useful proxy for the assessment of environmental health risks from ambient air pollutants and a valid approach for the assessment of the public health impacts of air pollution and the benefits of air quality improvement measures in developing countries where pollutant monitoring data are scarce.},

   abstract = {Background
Air pollution exposure has been linked to adverse respiratory health outcomes among children, primarily in studies of acute exposures that are often in limited geographic areas. We sought to assess the association between chronic outdoor air pollution exposure, as measured by 12-month averages by county, and asthma among children in metropolitan areas across the nation.
Methods
Eligible children included those aged 3–17 years residing in US metropolitan areas who were sampled in the 2001–2004 National Health Interview Survey (N=34,073). 12-month average air pollutant levels for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone and particulate matter were compiled by county for 2000–2004. Eligible children were linked to pollutant levels for the previous 12 months for their county of residence. Adjusted odds ratios of having current asthma or an asthma attack in the past 12 months were estimated in single pollutant logistic regression models.
Results
Children in counties with ozone and, to a less consistent degree, particulate matter levels in the highest quartile were more likely to have current asthma and/or a recent asthma attack than children residing in counties with the lowest pollution levels; the adjusted odds for current asthma for the highest quartile of estimated ozone exposure was 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15, 2.10) and for recent asthma attack 1.38 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.91). No associations were found with sulfur dioxide or nitrogen dioxide levels.
Conclusion
Although the current US standard for ozone is based on short-term exposure, this cross-sectional study suggests that chronic (12-month) exposure to ozone and particles is related to asthma outcomes among children in metropolitan areas throughout the US.},

   abstract = {Background
This study explores the role of race, ethnicity, and insurance status in modifying the effects of air pollution on children’s asthma hospitalizations in Phoenix, Arizona (US) between 2001 and 2003. While controlling for weather, interactions between nitrous dioxide (NO2) and race, ethnicity, and insurance status are used to predict relative risk for subgroups of children.
Methods
The generalized logit regression model for nominal categorical data within a multinomial likelihood framework was used. This model is specifically suited to small counts and the reporting of 95% confidence intervals for the odds ratio of hospital admission for one group as compared to another. The odds ratio is known to approximate relative risk for rare events.
Results
Several significant findings were found for race, ethnicity, and insurance status as modulators for the effect of NO2 on children’s risk for asthma hospitalization: (1) children without insurance have 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1–1.8) times higher risk of asthma admissions than those with private insurance at exceedances of 0.02 parts per million (ppm) of NO2 above the seasonal mean; the same finding holds for children without insurance as compared to those with Medicaid; (2) black children have 2.1 (95% CI: 1.3–3.3) times higher risk of hospitalization than Hispanic children at seasonal mean NO2 levels, but this disproportionate risk shrinks to 1.7 with exceedances of 0.02ppm of NO2 above the seasonal mean. Specific to finding (1) among those children without health insurance, Hispanic children have 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1–3.8) times higher risk of hospitalization than white children. Among all Hispanic children, those without health insurance have 1.9 (95% CI: 1.3–3.0) times greater risk than those with private insurance; the same finding holds for Hispanic children without insurance as compared to Hispanic children with Medicaid. Specific to finding (2), among children with private insurance, the disproportionate risk of black children as compared to Hispanic children is magnified by a factor of 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0–1.8) for exceedances of 0.02ppm of NO2 above the seasonal mean.
Conclusions
Although we cannot confirm a cause–effect relationship, this analysis suggests that increasing insurance enrollment for all children, and specifically Hispanic children, may reduce their disproportionate risk from exceedances of air pollution. There are few black children in Phoenix, so further studies are needed to investigate the increasing risk of black children with private insurance as compared to Hispanics at exceedances of NO2.},

Research evidence suggests that exposure to ambient air pollutants can adversely affect the growth and development of the foetus and infant survival. Much less is known regarding the potential for an association between black smoke air pollution and stillbirth risk. This potential association was examined using data from the historical cohort UK Particulate Matter and Perinatal Events Research (PAMPER) study.
Methods
Using data from paper-based neonatal records from the two major maternity hospitals in Newcastle upon Tyne (UK), a birth record database of all singletons born during 1961–1992 to mothers resident in the city was constructed. Weekly black smoke levels were obtained from routine data recorded at 20 air pollution monitoring stations over the study period. A two-stage statistical modelling strategy was used, incorporating temporally and spatially varying covariates to estimate black smoke exposure during each trimester and for the whole pregnancy period for each individual pregnancy. Conditional logistic regression models, with stratification on year of birth, were used to assess potential associations between black smoke exposures in pregnancy and stillbirth risk.
Results
The PAMPER database consists of 90,537 births, between 1962 and 1992, with complete gestational age and residential address information, of which 812 were stillborn. There was no association between black smoke exposures in any trimester or across whole pregnancy and risk of stillbirth. Adjustment for potential confounders did not alter these results.
Conclusions
While black smoke in pregnancy is likely to be related to other pregnancy outcomes, our findings do not suggest that black smoke air pollution exposure during pregnancy increases the risk of stillbirth.},

A total of 238,826 deaths were identified, along with 98,570 and 93,553 inpatient admissions for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, respectively. We found that the association with PM10 and mortality/morbidity increased during the summer. During the study period, 10μg/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with the increase in mortality by 0.28% (95% confidence interval: 0.12, 0.44), 0.51% (0.19, 0.83), and 0.59% (–0.08, 1.26) for non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory causes. 10μg/m3 increase in PM10 was also associated with increase in hospitalization from cardiovascular and respiratory causes by 0.77% (0.53, 1.01) and 1.19% (0.94, 1.44). In the summer, the increase in mortality and hospitalization was 0.57% (0.20, 0.93), 0.64% (–0.10, 1.38), 0.50% (–1.02, 2.05), 1.52% (0.89, 2.16), and 1.55% (0.87, 2.22).
Conclusions
This study provides evidence that the effect of PM10 on mortality and morbidity varies with season and increases during the summer season.},

Diagnosing lung function abnormalities requires application of the appropriate reference equation for a given patient population. Current guidelines recommend the National Health and Examination Study III data set for evaluating patients in the United States. In Caucasian patients, relying on older reference equations, as opposed to those derived from the NHANES III data set, will often result in a different interpretation of a patient's spirometry. The present study assessed whether similar discordance would occur in African–American patients. A cross-sectional analysis of African–American patients undergoing spirometry testing at our hospital was performed. Patients were classified as normal, restricted, obstructed or mixed based upon the ATS/ERS guidelines, using Crapo, Knudson, Morris, Glindmeyer, and NHANES III prediction equations. Differences in classification were evaluated. 4463 subjects were identified, with a mean age of 49.6. Discordance in interpretation was most common when results from prediction equations by Morris, Knudson, and Glindmeyer were compared to NHANES III (24.6%, 26.4%, and 20.1%, respectively). Discordance was less common when comparing Crapo to NHANES III (12.8%). There was a tendency for Knudson, Morris and Glindmeyer to under classify restriction, and for Crapo, Morris, and Glindmeyer to over classify obstruction. There is significant discordance in interpretation when spirometry for African–American patients is referenced to equations published by Crapo, Morris, Knudson, and Glindmeyer, compared to NHANES III.},

Objective
The associations between air pollution and children’s respiratory health in the high pollution range have not yet been clearly characterized. We evaluated the effects of outdoor air pollution on respiratory morbidity in children selected from multiple sites in a heavy industrial province of northeastern China.
Methods
The study included 11,860 children aged 3–12 years, selected from 18 districts of 6 cities in Liaoning province, the participation rate is 89.9%. Informed consent and written responses to surveys about children’s historic and current health status, personal and household characteristics, and other information were obtained from parents. A two-stage regression approach was applied in data analyses.
Results
There were wide gradients for TSP (188–689 μg/m3), SO2 (14–140 μg/m3 and NO2 (29–94 μg/m3) across the 18 districts of 6 cities. The three air pollutants significantly increased the prevalence of persistent cough (21–28%), persistent phlegm (21–30%) and current asthma (39–56%) for each interquartile range increment (172 μg/m3 for TSP, 69 μg/m3 for SO2, 30 μg/m3 for NO2), showing larger between-city effects than within-city. Rates of respiratory symptoms were significantly higher for children with younger age, atopy, respiratory disease in early age, family history of asthma or chronic bronchitis, and tobacco smoke exposure.
Conclusion
The high levels of outdoor air pollution in north China are positively associated with children’s respiratory symptoms, the associations with TSP appear to be stronger than SO2 and NO2.},

Objective
To evaluate the adverse effect of exposure to air pollution on lung function growth in school-aged children.
Methods
A cohort of 1983 children from three districts in Guangzhou, China was followed-up for 6 months. The children performed pulmonary function tests twice, and their parents reported the child’s respiratory symptoms by self-administered questionnaires in both surveys.
Results
The annual mean concentrations of air pollutants for the past 5 years for particulate matter less than 10 microns in diameter (PM10), nitrogen (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) were respectively: 96.1 μg/m3, 76.0 μg/m3, and 65.7 μg/m3 in the highly-polluted district (HPD), 80.3 μg/m3, 67.6 μg/m3, and 54.5 μg/m3 in the moderately-polluted district (MPD), and 80.0 μg/m3, 48.1 μg/m3, and 52.2 μg/m3 in the least-polluted district (LPD). After adjustment for potential confounders, significant deficits were found in the annual growth rates of forced expiratory flows at 25% (FEF25), and between 25% and 75% (FEF25–75) in boys and FEF25 in girls (In boys, for FEF25, −0.136 l/s, p = 0.008 in MPD and −0.153 l/s, p = 0.004 in HPD, respectively; for FEF25–75, −0.176 l/s, p = 0.013 in MPD and −0.167 l/s, p = 0.021 in HPD, respectively. In girls, for FEF25, −0.123 l/s, p = 0.043 in HPD), using LPD as the reference. Deficits in the annual growth rate of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were also negatively associated with air pollution in boys (−0.063 L, p = 0.032 in HPD).
Conclusions
The study adds more evidence that exposure to air pollution has adverse effects on lung function growth in schoolchildren.},

Background
Our aim was to explore the association between respiratory health and proximity air quality in elderly.
Methods
The prevalence of respiratory conditions was linked in 2104 individuals aged ≥65 years recruited in Bordeaux (3C Study) to home address concentrations of NO2, CO, SO2, fine particles (PM10), VOCs and benzene, estimated through a dispersion model combining data on background air pollution, traffic characteristics, and conditions of topographical and meteorological dispersion of air pollutants.
Results
Mean [minimum; maximum] values of the annual concentrations (μg/m3) of proximity air pollutants were respectively: 28 [18; 72.2] for NO2, 420 [350; 1337] for CO, 7.5[5; 13.7] for SO2, 23.1 [19; 51] for PM10, 8.1 [0.01; 116.6] for VOCs and 1.8 [1.5; 6.9] for benzene. Using a binary logistic regression model, PM10 were significantly associated with usual cough (Odds-Ratio=1.33 (95% confidence interval: 1.00–1.77) for exposed compared to non-exposed) and SO2 with usual cough (1.55 (1.16–2.08)) and phlegm (1.45 (1.04–2.01)). We found a 10% and a 23% increase in usual cough for a 10μg/m3 increment in PM10 and a 1μg/m3 increment in SO2 respectively, and a 23% increase in usual phlegm for a 1μg/m3 increase in SO2. A sensitivity analysis showed similar results when considering 3-year proximity pollution. A more pronounced effect of SO2 and PM10 on usual cough and phlegm was observed in woman.
Conclusions
Our assessment of exposure to proximity air pollution has shown an increased prevalence of bronchitis-like symptoms in elderly living in areas polluted by SO2 and PM10.},

   abstract = {This paper presents the contribution to population exposure (PE) of regional background fine primary (PPM2.5) and secondary inorganic (SIA) particulate matter and its impact on mortality in Europe during 1997–2003 calculated with a chemistry transport model. Contributions to concentrations and PE due to emissions from shipping, Western (WEU), Eastern (EEU), and Northern Europe are compared. WEU contributes about 40% to both PPM2.5 and SIA concentrations, whereas the EEU contribution to PPM2.5 is much higher (43% of total PPM2.5) than to SIA (29% of total SIA). The population weighted average concentration (PWC) of PPM2.5 is a factor of 2.3 higher than average (non-weighted) concentrations, whereas for SIA the PWC is only a factor 1.6 higher. This is due to PPM2.5 concentrations having larger gradients and being relatively high over densely populated areas, whereas SIA is formed outside populated areas. WEU emissions contribute relatively more than EEU to PWC and mortality due to both PPM2.5 and SIA in Europe. The number of premature deaths in Europe is estimated to 301 000 per year due to PPM2.5 exposure and 245 000 due to SIA, despite 3.3 times higher average SIA concentrations. This is due to population weighting and assumed (and uncertain) higher relative risk of mortality for PPM2.5 components (2.8 times higher RR for PPM2.5). This study indicates that it might be more efficient, for the health of the European population, to decrease primary PM emissions (especially in WEU) than to decrease precursors of SIA, but more knowledge on the toxicity of different PM constituents is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.},

   abstract = {Metropolitan Taipei, which is located in the subtropical area, is characterized by high population and automobile densities. For convenience, most primary schools are located near major roads. This study explores the exposure of acid aerosols for schoolchildren in areas in Taipei with different traffic densities. Acid aerosols were collected by using a honeycomb denuder filter pack sampling system (HDS). Experimental results indicated that the air pollutants were significantly correlated with traffic densities. The ambient air NO2, SO2, HNO3, NO3−, SO42−, and aerosol acidity concentrations were 31.3 ppb, 4.7 ppb, 1.3 ppb, 1.9 μg m−3, 18.5 μg m−3, and 49.5 nmol m−3 in high traffic density areas, and 6.1 ppb, 1.8 ppb, 0.9 ppb, 0.7 μg m−3, 8.8 μg m−3 and 14.7 nmol m−3 in low traffic density areas. The exposure levels of acid aerosols for schoolchildren would be higher than the measurements because the sampling height was 5 m above the ground. The SO2 levels were low (0.13–8.03 ppb) in the metropolitan Taipei. However, the SO42− concentrations were relatively high, and might be attributed to natural emissions of sulfur-rich geothermal sources. The seasonal variations of acid aerosol concentrations were also observed. The high levels of acidic particles in spring time may be attributed to the Asian dust storm and low height of the mixture layer. We conclude that automobile contributed not only the primary pollutants but also the secondary acid aerosols through the photochemical reaction. Schoolchildren were exposed to twice the acid aerosol concentrations in high traffic density areas compared to those in low traffic density areas. The incidence of allergic rhinitis of schoolchildren in the high traffic density areas was the highest in spring time. Accompanied by high temperature variation and high levels of air pollution in spring, the health risk of schoolchildren had been observed.},

   abstract = {A major issue in air pollution epidemiology is whether the associations that are found in the statistical analyses on the health effects of air pollution reflect real causal associations of single components or mixtures thereof, or just reflect statistical associations that are mainly the result of the high correlation between the separate components, one of them being the true causal factor. In a previous analysis on the relationship between daily SO2 levels and daily mortality in The Netherlands [Buringh, E., Fischer, P., Hoek, G., 2000. Is SO2 a causative factor for the PM-associated mortality risks in The Netherlands? Inhal. Toxicol. 12 (Suppl. 1), 55–60.], it was shown that the statistical significant association between daily variation in SO2 and daily mortality did not reflect a causal relation. Black Smoke levels in The Netherlands have decreased 4-fold during the 34 years in the period 1972–2006 (annual average from 27μgm−3 to 6μgm−3). This large decrease in concentrations enabled us to use the same approach for this component as was done earlier for SO2 to assess whether a decreasing trend in Black Smoke levels in The Netherlands is associated with an increasing trend in mortality relative risks or not. We used daily averaged Black Smoke (BS) data from 1972 to 2006. In the first two decades (1970–1990) only sparse data were available. Based on the availability of the data, we selected data from 1972 to 1974 and from 1982 to 1984 because during these two periods continuous daily measurement series were available. For the later years (1989–2006) data covering the whole of The Netherlands were available, giving a total of 24 years of daily data. Data on daily total mortality counts (excluding external causes), cardiovascular mortality and respiratory mortality for the whole population of The Netherlands were analyzed with regard to daily Black Smoke levels using generalized additive Poisson regression models (GAM). Period specific relative risk estimates were compared and differences in estimates between periods were evaluated. We found no consistent increase in relative risks for daily total and cause-specific mortality over time, despite the decreasing trend in the Black Smoke levels in The Netherlands. Average relative risks for total mortality varied over the different periods from 0.997 per 10μgm−3 daily Black Smoke to 1.010 per 10μgm−3. Average relative risks for cardiovascular mortality varied from 0.988 per 10μgm−3 to 1.010 per 10μgm−3 and for respiratory mortality from 1.000 to 1.010 per 10μgm−3. For weekly averaged concentrations the average relative risks for total mortality varied over the different periods from 1.004 per 10μgm−3 Black Smoke to 1.018 per 10μgm−3. Average relative risks for cardiovascular mortality varied from 1.003 per 10μgm−3 to 1.016 per 10 μgm−3 and for respiratory mortality from 1.000 to 1.050 per 10μgm−3. The result of our analyses suggests that Black Smoke cannot be excluded as a potential causal agent because relative risks over time show no increasing trend despite the decreasing trend in Black Smoke concentrations.},

   abstract = {Aerosols are harmful to human health and have both direct and indirect effects on climate. China is a major contributor to global emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), a sulfate (SO42−) precursor, organic carbon (OC), and black carbon (BC) aerosols. Although increasingly examined, the effect of present and potential future levels of these emissions on global premature mortality and climate change has not been well quantified. Through both direct radiative effects and indirect effects on clouds, SO42− and OC exert negative radiative forcing (cooling) while BC exerts positive forcing (warming). We analyze the effect of China's emissions of SO2, SO42−, OC and BC in 2000 and for three emission scenarios in 2030 on global surface aerosol concentrations, premature mortality, and radiative forcing (RF). Using global models of chemical transport (MOZART-2) and radiative transfer (GFDL RTM), and combining simulation results with gridded population data, mortality rates, and concentration–response relationships from the epidemiological literature, we estimate the contribution of Chinese aerosols to global annual premature mortality and to RF in 2000 and 2030. In 2000, we estimate these aerosols cause approximately 470 000 premature deaths in China and an additional 30 000 deaths globally. In 2030, aggressive emission controls lead to a 50% reduction in premature deaths from the 2000 level to 240 000 in China and 10 000 elsewhere, while under a high emissions scenario premature deaths increase 50% from the 2000 level to 720 000 in China and to 40 000 elsewhere. Because the negative RF from SO42− and OC is larger than the positive forcing from BC, Chinese aerosols lead to global net direct RF of −74mWm−2 in 2000 and between −15 and −97mWm−2 in 2030 depending on the emissions scenario. Our analysis indicates that increased effort to reduce greenhouse gases is essential to address climate change as China's anticipated reduction of aerosols will result in the loss of net negative radiative forcing.},

   abstract = {Improved understanding of the sources of air pollution that are most harmful could aid in developing more effective measures for protecting human health. The Denver Aerosol Sources and Health (DASH) study was designed to identify the sources of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) that are most responsible for the adverse health effects of short-term exposure to PM2.5. Daily 24-h PM2.5 sampling began in July 2002 at a residential monitoring site in Denver, Colorado, using both Teflon and quartz filter samplers. Sampling is planned to continue through 2008. Chemical speciation is being carried out for mass, inorganic ionic compounds (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium), and carbonaceous components, including elemental carbon, organic carbon, temperature-resolved organic carbon fractions and a large array of organic compounds. In addition, water-soluble metals were measured daily for 12 months in 2003. A receptor-based source apportionment approach utilizing positive matrix factorization (PMF) will be used to identify PM2.5 source contributions for each 24-h period. Based on a preliminary assessment using synthetic data, the proposed source apportionment should be able to identify many important sources on a daily basis, including secondary ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate, diesel vehicle exhaust, road dust, wood combustion and vegetative debris. Meat cooking, gasoline vehicle exhaust and natural gas combustion were more challenging for PMF to accurately identify due to high detection limits for certain organic molecular marker compounds. Measurements of these compounds are being improved and supplemented with additional organic molecular marker compounds. The health study will investigate associations between daily source contributions and an array of health endpoints, including daily mortality and hospitalizations and measures of asthma control in asthmatic children. Findings from the DASH study, in addition to being of interest to policymakers, by identifying harmful PM2.5 sources may provide insights into mechanisms of PM effect.},

   abstract = {This paper evaluates the ranking of 21 priority air pollutants with three indicator schemes: environmental pressure indicator (EPI), environmental quality indicator (EQI), and human health effect indicator (HEI). The EPI and EQI compare the emissions and concentrations with the target emissions and target concentrations, respectively. The HEI comprehends the steps from cause (i.e. national emissions) to effect (i.e. human health effects), and is the total human health burden, expressed in Disability Adjusted Life Years per year of exposure (DALYsyear−1). We estimated a health burden in the Netherlands of 41×103DALYsyear−1 caused by Dutch air emissions of PM10 and its precursors in the year 2003. The burden due to 17 carcinogenic substances emitted to air, was much lower (140DALYsyear−1). In contrast, when the same substances were evaluated regarding environmental pressure and environmental quality, carbon tetrachloride (pressure) and benzo[a]pyrene (quality) were of highest importance, whereas the importance of PM10 was substantially lower. This result is remarkable, because for the majority of substances evaluated, the target concentrations and target emissions are based on preventing human health damage. The differences in relevance are explained by the different weighting of interests in the indicators. The HEI is based on concentration–response relations, whereas the EPI and EQI also depend on other, policy-based, principles and on technical feasibility. Therefore, to effectively prioritize emission reduction measures in policy-making, substances should not only be evaluated as to whether emission targets and environmental quality targets are reached, but they should be evaluated regarding their human health impact as well. In this context, the HEI is a suitable indicator to evaluate the human health impact.},

   abstract = {Mortality is the most important health effect of ambient air pollution and has been studied the longest. The earliest evidence relates to fog episodes but with the development of more precise methods of investigation it is still possible to discern short-term temporal associations with daily mortality at the historically low levels of air pollution that now exist in most developed countries. Another early observation was that mortality was higher in more polluted areas. This has been confirmed by modern cohort studies that account for other potential explanations for such associations. There does not appear to be a threshold of effect within the ambient range of concentrations. Advances in the understanding of air pollution and mortality have been driven by the combined development of methods and biomedical concepts. The most influential methodological developments have been in time-series techniques and the establishment of large cohort studies, both of which are underpinned by advances in data processing and statistical analysis. On the biomedical side two important developments can be identified. One has been the application of the concept of multifactorial disease causation to explaining how air pollution may affect mortality at low levels and why thresholds are not obvious at the population level. The other has been an increasing understanding of how air pollution may plausibly have pathophysiological effects that are remote from the lung interface with ambient air. Together, these advances have had a profound influence on policies to protect public health. Throughout the history of air pollution epidemiology, mortality studies have been central and this will continue because of the widespread availability of mortality data on a large population scale and the weight that mortality carries in estimating impacts for policy development.},

   abstract = {Changes over recent decades in outdoor concentrations of air pollutants are well documented. However, the impacts of air pollution on an individual's health actually relate not to these outdoor concentrations but to their personal exposure in the different locations in which they spend time. Assessing how personal exposures differ from outdoor concentrations, and how they have changed over recent decades, is challenging. This review focuses on the exposure of children, since they are a particularly sensitive group. Much of children's time is spent indoors, and childhood exposure is closely related to concentrations in the home, at school, and in transport. For this reason, children's personal exposures to air pollutants differ significantly from both those of adults and from outdoor concentrations. They depend on a range of factors, including urbanisation, energy use, building design, travel patterns, and activity profiles; analysis of these factors can identify a wider range of policy measures to reduce children's exposure than direct emission control. There is a very large variation in personal exposure between individual children, caused by differences in building design, indoor and outdoor sources, and activity patterns. Identifying groups of children with high personal exposure, and their underlying causes, is particularly important in regions of the world where emissions are increasing, but there are limited resources for environmental and health protection. Although the science of personal exposure assessment, with the associated measurement and modelling techniques, has developed to maturity in North America and western Europe over the last 50 years, there is an urgent need to apply this science in other parts of the world where the effects of air pollution are now much more serious.},

Overall, PM10 (usually 200-day accumulation) and ozone (3-day accumulation) were the two important predictors of outcome but their effect was not uniform across the nine cities. Many models exhibited thresholds (25–45 μm g/m3 for PM10, and 10–45 ppb for O3). Our preliminary exploratory analyses suggest that the use of a linear, no threshold, model for pollution studies is not consistent with the observed data. The heterogeneity in the risk estimates across the nine cities suggests combining the local risk estimates to obtain a national risk estimate may not be justifiable and the estimate is likely to be confounded.},

Only women 18–35 years of age, who claimed to be non-smokers, with singleton pregnancies, without illicit drug use and HIV infection, free from chronic diseases were eligible for the study. A total of 481 enrolled pregnant women who gave birth between 37 and 43 weeks of gestation were included in the study. Prenatal personal exposure to fine particles over 48h during the second trimester was measured using personal monitors. To evaluate the relationship between the level of PM2.5 measured over 48h in the second trimester of pregnancy with those in the first and the third trimesters, a series of repeated measurements in each trimester was carried out in a random subsample of 85 pregnant women. We assessed the effect of PM2.5 exposure on the birth outcomes (weight, length and head circumference at birth) by multivariable regression models, controlling for potential confounders (maternal education, gestational age, parity, maternal height and prepregnancy weight, sex of infant, prenatal environmental tobacco smoke, and season of birth). Birth outcomes were associated positively with gestational age, parity, maternal height and prepregnancy weight, but negatively with the level of prenatal PM2.5 exposure. Overall average increase in gestational period of prenatal exposure to fine particles by about 30μg/m3, i.e., from 25th percentile (23.4μg/m3) to 75th percentile (53.1μg/m3) brought about an average birth weight deficit of 97.2g (95% CI: −201, 6.6) and length at birth of 0.7cm (95% CI: −1.36, −0.04). The corresponding exposure lead to birth weight deficit in male newborns of 189g (95% CI: −34.2, −343) in comparison to 17g in female newborns; the deficit of length at birth in male infants amounted to 1.1cm (95% CI: −0.11, −2.04). We found a significant interrelationship between self-reported ETS and PM2.5, however, none of the models showed a significant interaction of both variables. The joint effect of various levels of PM2.5 and ETS on birth outcomes showed the significant deficit only for the categories of exposure with higher component of PM2.5. Concluding, the results of the study suggest that observed deficits in birth outcomes are rather attributable to prenatal PM2.5 exposure and not to environmental tobacco smoke. The study also provided evidence that male fetuses are more sensitive to prenatal PM2.5 exposure and this should persuade policy makers to consider birth outcomes by gender separately while setting air pollution guidelines.},

The aims of this work were to characterize the aerobiology of the Platanus, Acer, Salix, Quercus, Betula and Populus pollen, linking it with monthly emergency hospital admissions and to identify the different reactivity levels in sensitized patients. This information would be of great importance to evaluate the convenience of changing the inventory of pollen producer trees related to the risk of allergenic reactions. The study was conducted in Porto, Portugal, from 2005 to 2007. Airborne pollen was sampled using a Hirst-type volumetric trap. The antigenic and allergenic properties of Acer negundo, Betula pendula, Platanus occidentalis, Populus hybrida, Quercus robur and Salix babylonica pollen, collected in public gardens or sidewalks, were investigated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunological techniques using polysensitized-patient sera. Monthly hospital admissions of asthma or dyspnea related with respiratory diseases were obtained from the Emergency Room database of Hospital Geral de Santo António. Tree pollen and hospital admissions were positively correlated. Tree pollen peaked in March which coincides with the hospital admissions maximum. The highest binding affinity was observed with A. negundo, S. babylonica and P. occidentalis pollen extracts and the lowest with P. hybrida. Consistently, Acer and Platanus maximum airborne pollen concentrations were observed during March attaining levels considered moderate to high risk for allergenic reactions. Prominent bands with approximately 71, 35, 31, 22, 19, 16, 14, 13 and 11kDa were revealed. A 52kDa band was shared by all analyzed sera. High levels of airborne pollen and emergency hospital admissions were related. High binding affinity of specific IgE to pollen extracts of the most abundant tree pollen present in the atmosphere was observed. Patient sera revealed multiple similar allergenic bands shared by the different extracts. This multidisciplinary approach is useful in day-to-day medical practice to help in diagnostic, therapeutic and allergy alerting system adjusting.},

Brain inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Hypothesizing therefore that long-term exposure to fine PM might contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the objective of this study was to investigate the association between exposure to fine PM and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which is associated with a high risk of progression to AD. A study group of 399 women aged 68–79 years who lived for more than 20 years at the same residential address has been assessed for long-term exposure to PM and tested for MCI. The exposure assessment comprised background concentration of PM10 and traffic-related PM indicated by the distance of the residential address to the next busy road. The women were assessed for MCI by a battery of several neuropsychological tests and their odor identification ability. Consistent effects of traffic-related air pollution exposure on test performances including a dose–response relation were found. The associations were adjusted for potential confounders using regression analysis. These results indicate that chronic exposure to traffic-related PM may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.},

   abstract = {In the past decade there have been an increasing number of scientific studies describing possible effects of air pollution on perinatal health. These papers have mostly focused on commonly monitored air pollutants, primarily ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and various indices of perinatal health, including fetal growth, pregnancy duration, and infant mortality. While most published studies have found some marker of air pollution related to some types of perinatal outcomes, variability exists in the nature of the pollutants and outcomes associated. Synthesis of the findings has been difficult for various reasons, including differences in study design and analysis. A workshop was held in September 2007 to discuss methodological differences in the published studies as a basis for understanding differences in study findings and to identify priorities for future research, including novel approaches for existing data. Four broad topic areas were considered: confounding and effect modification, spatial and temporal exposure variations, vulnerable windows of exposure, and multiple pollutants. Here we present a synopsis of the methodological issues and challenges in each area and make recommendations for future study. Two key recommendations include: (1) parallel analyses of existing data sets using a standardized methodological approach to disentangle true differences in associations from methodological differences among studies; and (2) identification of animal studies to inform important mechanistic research gaps. This work is of critical public health importance because of widespread exposure and because perinatal outcomes are important markers of future child and adult health.},

The aim of this study is to investigate the association between exposure to black smoke (BS; particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <4μg/m3) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) during the first trimester of pregnancy and risk of congenital anomalies. We used a case–control study design among deliveries to mothers resident in the UK Northern health region during 1985–1990. Case data were ascertained from the population-based Northern Congenital Abnormality Survey and control data from national data on all births. Data on BS and SO2 from ambient air monitoring stations were used to average the total pollutant exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy over the daily readings from all monitors within 10km of the mother's residence. Logistic regression models estimated the association via odds ratios. A significant but weak positive association was found between nervous system anomalies and BS (OR=1.10 per increase of 1000μg/m3 total BS; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.18), but not with other anomaly subtypes. For SO2, a significant negative association was found with congenital heart disease combined and patent ductus arteriosus: OR significantly <1 for all quartiles relative to the first quartile. The relationship between SO2 levels and other anomaly subtypes was less clear cut: there were either no significant associations or a suggestion of a U-shaped relationship (OR significantly <1 for moderate compared to lowest levels, but not with high SO2 levels). Overall, maternal exposure to BS and SO2 in the Northern region had limited impact on congenital anomaly risk. Studies with detailed exposure assessment are needed to further investigate this relationship.},

Studies suggest that increases of fine particle concentrations (PM2.5) could be linked with a rise in cardiovascular disease. With approximately 25% of American adults aged 30 and older reporting having either heart disease or hypertension it is possible that exposure to air pollution could have significant public health consequences. This study examined the relationship between PM2.5 and the prevalence of self-reported hypertension and heart disease using data from a large nation-wide survey.
Study design
Adults, 30 years of age or older, who participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 1999 to 2005 were linked to annual PM2.5 data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (N=132,224). Annual air quality estimates were averaged from monitors within 20 miles of the respondent's residential block group. Respondents who reported being told they had hypertension by a health professional on two or more separate occasions were defined as hypertensive. Heart disease was defined as answering, “yes” to one or more of three NHIS questions on heart disease.
Results
A 10μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure was associated with a small elevated risk of hypertension (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00–1.10) risk of heart disease (1.08 95% CI 1.00–1.16). The association between PM2.5 and hypertension was found in non-Hispanic white adults (OR 1.10 95% CI 1.04–1.17) but not in non-Hispanic black or Hispanic adults.
Conclusions
Findings from this study complement those from other studies and indicate that PM2.5 adversely affects cardiovascular health. Our results are consistent with other studies in showing a small association between exposure to PM2.5 and cardiovascular outcomes.},

In utero exposures that result in DNA damage may affect health later in life. Early effects of maternal and in utero exposures to traffic-related air pollution were assessed through the use of validated biomarkers in blood cells from mother–newborn pairs. A cross-sectional biomonitoring study with healthy pregnant women living in the Greater Copenhagen area, Denmark, was conducted. Bulky DNA adducts and micronuclei (MN) were measured in blood from 75 women and 69 umbilical cords, concurrently collected at the time of planned Caesarean section. Modeled residential traffic density, a proxy measure of traffic-related air pollution exposures, was validated by indoor levels of nitrogen dioxide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in 42 non-smoking homes. DNA adduct levels were similar and positively correlated in maternal and cord blood (1.40 vs. 1.37n/108 nucleotides; r=0.99; p<0.01). Maternal MN frequencies were significantly associated with age (p<0.01), and higher than those of the newborns (7.0 vs. 3.2 MN per 1000 binucleated cells). Adduct levels were highest among mother–newborn pairs who lived near medium-traffic-density (>400–2500vehiclekm/24h; p<0.01) places. MN frequencies among newborns from women who lived at high-traffic-density homes (>2500vehiclekm/24h) were significantly increased (p=0.02). This trend remained after adjusting for potential confounders and effect modifiers. For the first time increased bulky DNA adducts and MN in cord blood after maternal exposures to traffic-related air pollution are found, demonstrating that these transplacental environmental exposures induce DNA damage in newborns. Given that increased DNA damage early in life indicate an increased risk for adverse health effects later in life, these findings justify intervention of pregnant women.},

   abstract = {Background
Previous research demonstrates that ambient air pollution exacerbates asthma. Asthma morbidity also varies with socioeconomic position (SEP). Few studies have examined if ambient air pollution has a differential impact on income subgroups of the population. This paper investigates socioeconomic variation in ambulatory physician consultations for asthma and assesses possible effect modification of SEP on the association between physician visits and air pollution for children aged 1–17 and adults aged 18–64 in Toronto, Canada, between 1992 and 2001.
Methods
Generalized additive models and generalized linear models were used to estimate the adjusted risk of asthma physician visits associated with an interquartile range increase in sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5), and ozone (O3).
Results
A socioeconomic gradient in the number of physician visits was observed among children and adults and both sexes. SO2, NO2, and PM2.5 had positive associations with physician visits. The risk ratios for the low socioeconomic group were significantly greater than those for the high socioeconomic group in several of the models of SO2 and PM2.5.
Conclusions
These findings suggest increased ambulatory physician visits represent another component of the public health impact of urban air pollution. The burden of this impact may be borne disproportionately by those with lower SEP. Clarifying the role of SEP in altering susceptibility to the effects of air pollution is essential not only to inform revisions of ambient air quality standards, but also to design public health interventions to reduce health impacts on sensitive subgroups of the population.},

Many studies have investigated the effects of air pollutants on disease and mortality. However, the results remain inconsistent and inconclusive. We thought that the impact of different seasons or ages of people may explain these differences.
Methods
Measurement of the five pollutants (particulate matter <10μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), SO2, NO2, O3, and CO) was monitored by automated measuring units at five different stations. Monitoring stations were provided by the Taiwan Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from 1997 to 1999. The subjects in the study were classified in two groups: those 65 years of age and older, and those of all ages (including the subjects in the ⩾65 group). Data on daily mortality caused by respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and all other causes including the two aforementioned was collected by the Taiwan Department of Health (DOH). A time-series regression model was used to analyze the relative risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases due to air pollution in the summer and winter seasons.
Results
Risk of death from all causes and mortality from cardiovascular diseases during winter was significantly positively correlated with levels of SO2, CO, and NO2 for both groups of subjects and additionally with PM10 for the elderly (⩾65 years old) group. There were significant positive correlations with respiratory diseases and levels of O3 for both groups. However, the only significant positive correlation was with O3 (RR=1.283) for the elderly group during summer. No other parameters showed significance for either group.
Conclusion
Our findings contribute to the evidence of an association between SO2, CO, NO2, and PM10 and mortality from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, especially among elderly people during the winter season.},

Effect estimates derived from conditional logistic regression revealed very modest increased risk and were not statistically significant for any of the exposure metrics in fully adjusted models. Overall, risk estimates were stronger when restricted to bronchiolitis cases attributed to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) versus unspecified and for longer exposure windows. The adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) and 95% confidence interval per 10mcg/m3 increase in lifetime PM2.5 was 1.14, 0.88–1.46 for RSV bronchiolitis hospitalization. This risk was also elevated for infants who resided within 150m of a highway (ORadj 1.17, 0.95–1.44). This study supports a developing hypothesis that there may be a modest increased risk of bronchiolitis attributable to chronic traffic-derived particulate matter exposure particularly for infants born just before or during peak RSV season. Future studies are needed that can investigate threshold effects and capture larger variability in spatial contrasts among populations of infants.},

Investigation took place during wintertime of 2006 at two heights above ground: at the street level (1.5m) and at the rooftop level (15m). Size-resolved samples (<0.95μm, 0.95–1.5μm, 1.5–3μm, 3–7.5μm and >7.5μm) were concurrently collected from the two height levels using five-stage high volume cascade impactors. At both heights, particle mass exhibited bimodal distribution with peaks in the 0.95–1.5μm and the 3–7.5μm size fractions, whereas most organic pollutants exhibited one peak at 0.95–1.5μm. Apart from the 0.95–1.5μm fraction, particle concentrations of all size ranges were significantly higher at the street level than at the rooftop as a result of more intensive vehicular emissions and road dust resuspension. On the contrary, the concentrations of most organic pollutants did not differentiate significantly between the two elevations.},

Naphthalene, acenaphthylene, and acenaphthene were the most abundant gas PAHs while fluoranthene and pyrene were the most abundant in the particle phase. Most (98%) of the gas PAHs consisted of two- and three-aromatic rings whereas most of the particle-phase PAHs were in four- (∼60%) and five-ring (∼17%) for fresh exhaust emissions. Average emission factors for the gas- and particle PAHs were 950–2564 μg veh−1 km−1 and 22–354 μg veh−1 km−1, respectively. Good correlations were found between diesel markers (fluoranthene and pyrene; 0.85) and gasoline markers (benzo[ghi]perylene and indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene; 0.96). Higher PAH emission factors were associated with a higher fraction of diesel-fueled vehicles (DV) passing through the tunnel. Separate emission factors were determined from diesel and non-diesel exhaust by the regression intercept method. The average PAH emission factor (i.e., sum of gas and particle phases) from DV (3085 ± 1058 μg veh−1 km−1) was ∼5 times higher than that from non-diesel-fueled vehicles (NDV, 566 ± 428 μg veh−1 km−1). Ratios of DV to NDV emission factors were high for diesel markers (>24); and low for gasoline markers (<0.4).},

Indoor PM2.5 and CO2 were elevated in homes for which the number of hours with door/window open was zero compared to homes in which the number of hours was high (>15 h). Indoor PM2.5 levels did not correlate with outdoor levels and tended to increase with number of inhabitants, and results indicate that the source of indoor particles were occupants and their activities, excluding smoking and cooking. Mean indoor CO2 and CO levels were 1170 and 2.4 ppm, respectively. Carbon monoxide was higher than the 24-h National Ambient Air Quality Standard in 3 of the homes.

Extraction of the air samples was conducted using an accelerated solvent extraction method followed by isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry determination. Distinct seasonal variations were observed in total PAH concentration (i.e. significantly higher concentrations in December than in June). Mean concentrations for total particulate PAHs in December were 3.16, 4.13, and 3.40ngm−3 for the urban, suburban and rural sites, respectively, compared with 0.60, 0.74, and 0.24ngm−3 in June. Overall, the suburban site, which is impacted by a nearby major highway, had higher PAH concentration than did the urban site. Total PAH concentrations were found to be well correlated with PM2.5, organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC) in both months (r2=0.36–0.78, p<0.05), although the slopes from the two months were different. PAHs represented on average 0.006% of total PM2.5 mass and 0.017% of OC in June, compared with 0.033% of total PM2.5 and 0.14% of OC in December. Total PAH concentrations were also correlated with potassium ion (r2=0.39, p=0.014) in December, but not in June, suggesting that in winter biomass burning can potentially be an important source for particulate PAH. Retene was found at a higher median air concentration at the rural site than at the urban and suburban sites—unlike the rest of the PAHs, which were found at lower levels at the rural site. Retene also had a larger seasonal difference and had the weakest correlation with the rest of the PAHs measured, suggesting that retene, in particular, might be associated with biomass burning.},

In order to characterize Khamaseen dust in Jordan, we collected dust from ten localities during the spring of 2006. The collected dust was analyzed for grain size, mineralogy, and chemical composition. The dust is predominantly aluminosilicates (clay minerals and feldspars), quartz and carbonates with minor amounts of phosphate. The particles are mostly subrounded to subangular and generally between 5 and 20 μm in size. The majority of the elements analyzed have a natural abundance and distribution. However, several elements such as As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Se and Zn have higher than natural abundances due to anthropogenic enrichment by various enrichment factors. The analyzed dust samples are chemically homogenous, indicating a similar provenance and good mixing by the Khamaseen winds. The rare earth elements patterns are similar to those of the upper continental crust composition and average shale. Total amount of dust deposited on Jordan during the spring of 2006 is around 0.3 million tons.},

   abstract = {Acrolein (2-propenal) is a common constituent of both indoor and outdoor air, can exacerbate asthma in children, and may contribute to other chronic lung diseases. Recent studies have found high indoor levels of acrolein and other carbonyls compared to outdoor ambient concentrations. Heated cooking oils produce considerable amounts of acrolein, thus cooking is likely an important source of indoor acrolein. A series of cooking experiments were conducted to determine the emission rates of acrolein and other volatile carbonyls for different types of cooking oils (canola, soybean, corn and olive oils) and deep-frying different food items. Similar concentrations and emission rates of carbonyls were found when different vegetable oils were used to deep-fry the same food product. The food item being deep-fried was generally not a significant source of carbonyls compared to the cooking oil. The oil cooking events resulted in high concentrations of acrolein that were in the range of 26.4–64.5 μg m−3. These concentrations exceed all the chronic regulatory exposure limits and many of the acute exposure limits. The air exchange rate and the decay rate of the carbonyls were monitored to estimate the half-life of the carbonyls. The half-life for acrolein was 14.4 ± 2.6 h, which indicates that indoor acrolein concentrations can persist for considerable time after cooking in poorly-ventilated homes.},

   abstract = {Extensive measurements on particle number concentration and size distribution (13–800 nm), together with detailed chemical composition of PM2.5 have constituted the main inputs of the database used for a source apportionment analysis. Data were collected at an urban background site in Barcelona, Western Mediterranean. The source identification analysis helped us to distinguish five emission sources (vehicle exhausts, mineral dust, sea spray, industrial source and fuel-oil combustion) and two atmospheric processes (photochemical induced nucleation and regional/urban background particles derived from coagulation and condensation processes). After that, a multilinear regression analysis was applied in order to quantify the contribution of each factor. This study reveals that vehicle exhausts contribute dominantly to the number concentration in all the particle sizes (52–86%), but especially in the range 30–200 nm. This work also points out the importance of the regional and/or urban formed aerosols (secondary inorganic particles) on the total number concentration (around 25% of the total number), with a higher impact on the accumulation mode. The photo-chemically induced nucleation of aerosols only represents a small proportion of the total number as an annual mean (3%), but is very relevant when considering only the nucleation mode (13–20 nm) fraction (23%). The other sources recognized registered sporadic contributions to the total number, coinciding with specific meteorological scenarios. This study discloses the main sources and features affecting and controlling the fine and ultra-fine aerosols in a typical city in the Western Mediterranean coast. Whereas the road traffic appears to be the most important source of sub-micrometric aerosols, other sources may not be negligible under specific meteorological conditions.},

Daily mean [BC] varied from about 1 to 15μgm−3. However, short-term spikes exceeding 40μgm−3 were common, occurring primarily during the morning and evening rush-hour periods. The [BC] values were highest during November through February, ∼10μgm−3, and lowest during June through September, ∼2μgm−3. Diurnal, seasonal, and day-of-the-week trends are discussed. It is demonstrated that these trends are strongly affected by meteorological patterns. A simple expression is applied to the concentration profiles to separate the effects of meteorological conditions and elucidate the underlying emissions patterns. Daily emissions varied from 14,000 to 22,000kg of BC per day. When integrated over the year emissions for Karachi Proper were estimated at 6.7 kilometric tons per year and emissions for greater Karachi were 17.5 kilometric tons per year. Folding in the populations of each area yields BC emissions of 0.74 and 1.1kg per person per year, respectively. Applying the model to previously collected data at Lahore, Pakistan yields emissions during November–January that are around a factor of two higher than those in Karachi, but because the BC measurements in Lahore covered only three months, no estimates of annual emissions were attempted. Given the large populations of these cities the local health impact from PM alone is expected to be severe but because of the high [BC] emissions the impact on the global climate may be equally significant.},

   abstract = {The objective of this study is to investigate the air ventilation impacts of the so called “wall effect” caused by the alignment of high-rise buildings in complex building clusters. The research method employs the numerical algorithm of computational fluid dynamics (CFD – FLUENT) to simulate the steady-state wind field in a typical Hong Kong urban setting and investigate pollutant dispersion inside the street canyon utilizing a pollutant transport model. The model settings of validation study were accomplished by comparing the simulation wind field around a single building block to wind tunnel data. The results revealed that our model simulation is fairly close to the wind tunnel measurements. In this paper, a typical dense building distribution in Hong Kong with 2 incident wind directions (0° and 22.5°) is studied. Two performance indicators are used to quantify the air ventilation impacts, namely the velocity ratio (VR) and the retention time (Tr) of pollutants at the street level. The results indicated that the velocity ratio at 2m above ground was reduced 40% and retention time of pollutants increased 80% inside the street canyon when high-rise buildings with 4 times height of the street canyon were aligned as a “wall” upstream. While this reduction of air ventilation was anticipated, the magnitude is significant and this result clearly has important implications for building and urban planning.},

   abstract = {This paper presents the contribution to population exposure (PE) of regional background fine primary (PPM2.5) and secondary inorganic (SIA) particulate matter and its impact on mortality in Europe during 1997–2003 calculated with a chemistry transport model. Contributions to concentrations and PE due to emissions from shipping, Western (WEU), Eastern (EEU), and Northern Europe are compared. WEU contributes about 40% to both PPM2.5 and SIA concentrations, whereas the EEU contribution to PPM2.5 is much higher (43% of total PPM2.5) than to SIA (29% of total SIA). The population weighted average concentration (PWC) of PPM2.5 is a factor of 2.3 higher than average (non-weighted) concentrations, whereas for SIA the PWC is only a factor 1.6 higher. This is due to PPM2.5 concentrations having larger gradients and being relatively high over densely populated areas, whereas SIA is formed outside populated areas. WEU emissions contribute relatively more than EEU to PWC and mortality due to both PPM2.5 and SIA in Europe. The number of premature deaths in Europe is estimated to 301 000 per year due to PPM2.5 exposure and 245 000 due to SIA, despite 3.3 times higher average SIA concentrations. This is due to population weighting and assumed (and uncertain) higher relative risk of mortality for PPM2.5 components (2.8 times higher RR for PPM2.5). This study indicates that it might be more efficient, for the health of the European population, to decrease primary PM emissions (especially in WEU) than to decrease precursors of SIA, but more knowledge on the toxicity of different PM constituents is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.},

   abstract = {A monitoring campaign was performed in Santiago de Chile during a winter month of 2003 and 2006 (July) using several instruments to measure the size distribution of particulate material. For the first time, the size distribution of ultrafine particles was measured in Santiago, and an estimation of its sources was done by analyzing its temporal variation. The study was performed in three sites; one of them is located in the eastern part of Santiago, a sector with low particle concentration and about 100 m from a busy street. The other site is located in the western part, which is the sector that has the highest concentration of fine and coarse particle matter during winter, also located far from a street. The third site is located within 5 m from the busiest street in Santiago. In all stations traffic is the dominating source for fine and ultrafine particles and the size distribution is peaked towards 60–100 nm (soot mode). Only in the site near the street, it is possible to see a clear peak towards smaller sizes (10–30 nm). The size distribution measurements presented here indicate that aerosol dynamics play a more important role for the Santiago case as compared to cleaner cities in Europe. Changes in the particle size during different hours of the day reflect both variations in meteorological mixing conditions as well as effects of aerosol dynamic processes such as coagulation, condensation and dry deposition. A relative increase in the number of the larger ultrafine particles (d ≥ 70 nm), as compared to the number of smaller particles (d < 70 nm) correlated with wind speed is an indication of pollution transport with aged particles from other parts of the city.},

The suburban site, located near a major highway, had higher PM2.5-bound PAH concentrations than did the urban site, and the rural site had the lowest PAH levels. Monthly variations are described for concentrations of total PAHs (∑PAHs) and individual PAHs. PAH concentrations were much higher in cold months than in warm months, with average monthly ∑PAH concentrations at the urban and suburban-highway monitoring sites ranging from 2.12 to 6.85 ng m−3 during January–February and November–December 2004, compared to 0.38–0.98 ng m−3 during May–September 2004. ∑PAH concentrations were found to be well correlated with PM2.5 and organic carbon (OC) within seasons, and the fractions of PAHs in PM2.5 and OC were higher in winter than in summer. Methyl phenanthrenes were present at higher levels than their un-substituted homologue (phenanthrene), suggesting a petrogenic (unburned petroleum products) input. Retene, a proposed tracer for biomass burning, peaked in March, the month with the highest acreage and frequency of prescribed burning and unplanned fires, and in December, during the high residential wood-burning season, indicating that retene might be a good marker for burning of all biomass materials. In contrast, potassium peaked only in December, indicating that it might be a more specific tracer for wood-burning.},

This study investigates the levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulate matter (PM) in the long-distance buses in Taiwan. Analytical results indicate that pollutants levels in long-distance buses are generally lower than those in urban buses. This finding is attributable to the driving speed and patterns of long-distance buses, as well as the meteorological and geographical features of the highway surroundings. The levels of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) found in bus cabins exceed the proposed indoor VOC guidelines for aromatic compounds, and are likely attributable to the interior trim in the cabins. The overall average CO level is 2.3 ppm, with higher average level on local streets (2.9 ppm) than on highways (2.2 ppm). The average CO2 level is 1493 ppm, which is higher than the guideline for non-industrial occupied settings. The average PM level in this study is lower than those in urban buses and IAQ guidelines set by Taiwan EPA. However, the average PM10 and PM2.5 is higher than the level set by WHO. Besides the probable causes mentioned above, fewer passenger movements and less particle re-suspension from bus floor might also cause the lower PM levels. Measurements of particle size distribution reveal that more than 75% of particles are in submicron and smaller sizes. These particles may come from the infiltration from the outdoor air. This study concludes that air exchange rates in long-distance buses should be increased in order to reduce CO2 levels. Future research on long-distance buses should focus on the emission of VOCs from brand new buses, and the sources of submicron particles in bus cabins.},

   abstract = {Mobile measurements of ambient noise and particle number concentrations were carried out within an urban residential area in Essen, Germany, during summer 2008. A busy major road with a traffic intensity of about 44,000 vehicles per day was situated within the study area. The spatio-temporal distribution of noise and particles was closely coupled to road traffic on the major road. Total particle number concentrations in proximity to the main road were on average between 25,000 cm−3 and 35,000 cm−3 while sound levels reached 70–78 dB(A). These estimates were more than double-fold (factor 2.4) in comparison to the urban residential background. At a 50 m distance off the road particle number concentrations were decaying to about 50% of the initial value. The measurements were characterised by close spatial correlation between total particle number concentration and ambient noise with correlation coefficients of up to r = 0.74. However, during one measurement day coupling between both quantities was weak due to higher turbulent mixing within the canopy layer and a change in ambient wind directions. Enhanced dilution of particle emission from road traffic by turbulent mixing and ‘decoupling’ from the influence of road traffic are believed to be responsible.},

   abstract = {The sensitivity of the CHIMERE model to emission reduction scenarios on particulate matter PM2.5 and ozone (O3) in Northern Italy is studied. The emissions of NOx, PM2.5 SO2, VOC or NH3 were reduced by 50% for different source sectors for the Lombardy region, together with 5 additional scenarios to estimate the effect of local measures on improving the air quality for the Po valley area. Firstly, we evaluate the model performance by comparing calculated surface aerosol concentrations for the standard case (no emission reductions) with observations for January and June 2005. Calculated monthly mean PM10 concentrations are in general underestimated. For June, modelled PM10 concentrations slightly overestimate the measurements. Calculated monthly mean SO4, NO3−, NH4+ concentrations are in good agreement with the observations for January and June. Secondly, the model sensitivity of emission reduction scenarios on PM2.5 and O3 calculated concentrations for the Po valley area is evaluated. The most effective scenarios to abate PM2.5 concentration are based on the SNAP2 (non-industrial combustion plants) and SNAP7 (road traffic) sectors, for which the NOx and PM2.5 emissions are reduced by 50%. The number of days that the 2015 PM2.5 limit value of 25μgm−3 in Milan is exceeded by reducing primary PM2.5 and NOx emissions for SNAP2 and 7 by 50%, does not change in January when compared to the standard case for the Milan area. It appears that 40% of the PM2.5 concentration in the greater Milan area is caused by the emissions surrounding the Lombardy region and from the model boundary conditions. This study also showed that a more effective pollutant reduction (emissions) per ton of pollutant reduced (concentrations) for the greater Milan area is obtained by reducing the primary PM2.5 emissions for SNAP7 by 50%. The most effective scenario on PM2.5 decrease for which precursor emissions are reduced is achieved by reducing SO2 emissions by 50% for SNAP7. Our study showed that during summer time, the largest reductions in O3 concentrations are achieved for SNAP7 emission reductions, when volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are reduced by 50%.},

   abstract = {The primary objective of the Detroit Exposure and Aerosol Research Study (DEARS) was to compare air pollutant concentrations measured at various neighborhoods, or exposure monitoring areas (EMAs), throughout a major metropolitan area to levels measured at a central site or community monitor. One of the EMAs was located near a busy freeway (annual average daily traffic (AADT) of ∼130,000) so that impacts of mobile sources could be examined. Air pollution concentrations from the roadway-proximate sites were compared to the central site monitor. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) selected (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p- and o-xylene, 1,3 butadiene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene and 4-ethyltoluene) are typically associated with mobile sources. Gradients were also evident that demonstrated the amplification of pollutant levels near the roadway compared to the community monitor. A novel distance-to-roadway proximity metric was developed to plot the measurements and model these gradients. Effective distance represents the actual distance an air parcel travels from the middle of a roadway to a site and varies as a function of wind direction, whereas perpendicular distance is a fixed distance oriented normal to the roadway. Perpendicular distance is often used as a proxy for exposures to traffic emissions in epidemiological studies. Elevated concentrations of all the compounds were found for both a summer and winter season. Effective distance was found to be a statistically significant (p<0.05) univariate predictor for concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene and o-xylene for summer 2005. For each of these pollutants, effective distance yielded lower p-values than the corresponding perpendicular distance models, and model fit improved. Results demonstrate that this near-road EMA had elevated levels of traffic-related VOCs compared to the community monitor, and that effective distance was a more accurate predictor of the degree to which they were elevated as a function of distance. Effective distance produced a range of distance-to-roadway values for a single site based on wind direction, thus increasing the number and range of values that could be used to plot and predict relative differences in pollutant concentrations between two sites.},

Contamination levels were assessed based on the geoaccumulation index and the enrichment factor. The results show that magnetic susceptibilities of roadway dust were higher than Holocene loess–soil of central Shaanxi Loess Plateau. The mean contents of organic matter, PM10 and PM100 were 8.8%, 21.8% and 98.6%, respectively. Mercury concentration ranged from 0.48 to 2.32 μg g−1, with a mean value of 1.11 μg g−1, 17.1 times the Chinese soil mercury background value and 37 times the Shaanxi soil mercury background value. Arsenic concentration ranged from 9.0 to 42.8 μg g−1, with a mean value of 19.8 μg g−1, 1.8 times the Chinese and Shaanxi soil arsenic background values. The geoaccumlation index and enrichment factor indicate that mercury in the dust mainly originated from anthropogenic sources with ratings of “strongly polluted” and “strongly to extremely polluted”, whereas arsenic in dust originated from both natural and anthropogenic sources, with a ratings of “moderately to strongly polluted” and “strongly polluted”. Industrial activities, such as a coal-fired power station, coke-oven plant, and cement manufacturing plant, augmented by vehicular traffic, are the anthropogenic sources of mercury and arsenic in the roadway dust.},

To date there is no control of the amounts of fine and coarse aerosols concentrations and the source and chemical characterizations of the PM2.5 particulates in the carbonaceous fractions are not well known even though this fraction could be represented almost the 50% in mass of the PM2.5. In this work, we present for the first time determinations of primary organic aerosol (POA) and secondary organic aerosol composition (SOA) fractions of the total mass of PM2.5 particulates collected in the urban atmosphere of Santiago City. Our purpose is to know the anthropogenic contributions to the formation of SOA. To accomplish this we used the elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) determinations developed by automatic monitoring stations installed in the city during the period 2002–2005, with a particular analysis of the summer time occurred in February 2004. Based on the EC tracer method, we have estimated the POA and SOA fraction and our data permit us to estimate the SOA reaching up to 20% of total organic aerosol matter, in good agreement to other measurements observed in large cities of Europe and U.S.A.},

The present study aims to provide a preliminary assessment of BVOC emissions in Hong Kong (HKSAR). Thriteen local tree species were measured for their isoprene emission potential. Tree distribution was estimated for country park areas based on field survey data. Plant emission data obtained from measurements and the literature, tree distribution estimation data, land use information, and meteorological data were combined to estimate annual BVOC emissions of 8.6×109gC for Hong Kong. Isoprene, monoterpenes, and other VOCs contributed about 30%, 40%, and 30% of the estimated total annual emissions, respectively. Although hundreds of plant species are found in Hong Kong country parks, the model results indicate that only 10 tree species contribute about 76% of total annual VOC emissions. Prominent seasonal and diurnal variations in emissions were also predicted by the model. The present study lays a solid foundation for future local research, and results can be applied for studying BVOC emissions in nearby southern China and Asian regions that share similar climate and plant distributions.},

Samplings of PM2.5 were daily performed between March and November 2007 in Sacca San Biagio island (Venice), and values of PM2.5 concentration and element concentration were obtained. Monthly average concentrations (μg m−3) during this period show higher values during the spring and the autumn. A good relationship between data obtained and concentration values from environmental local agencies is evidenced, both for PM2.5 from urban area (Venezia Mestre), and for PM10 sampled in the same area, as well as the influence of some meteorological parameters on PM2.5 concentration sampled. Trace elements samples were measured by an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (ICP-QMS), and values (ng m−3 and μg g−1) for elements regulated by European directives (As, Cd, Ni, Pb), as well as, other elements (Na, Al, K, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Zn, Se, Ag) are also reported.

For this aerosol source apportionment study, the atmospheric aerosol sampling was performed at ten sites distributed in different locations of the metropolitan area from September/2003 to December/2005, with sampling during 24h on a weekly basis. Stacked filter units (SFU) were used to collect fine and coarse aerosol particles with a flow rate of 17Lmin−1. In both size fractions trace elements were analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) as well as water-soluble species by Ion-Chromatography (IC). Also gravimetric analysis and reflectance measurements provided aerosol mass and black carbon concentrations. Very good detection limits for up to 42 species were obtained. Mean annual PM10 mass concentration ranged from 20 to 37μgm−3, values that are within the Brazilian air quality standards. Receptor models such as principal factor analysis, cluster analysis and absolute principal factor analysis were applied in order to identify and quantify the aerosol sources. For fine and coarse modes, circa of 100% of the measured mass was quantitatively apportioned to relatively few identified aerosol sources. A very similar and consistent source apportionment was obtained for both fine and coarse modes for all 10 sampling sites. Soil dust is an important component, accounting for 22–72% and for 25–48% of the coarse and fine mass respectively. On the other hand, anthropogenic sources as vehicle traffic and oil combustion represent a relatively high contribution (52–75%) of the fine aerosol mass. The joint use of ICP-MS and IC analysis of species in aerosols has proven to be reliable and feasible for the analysis of large amount of samples, and the coupling with receptor models provided an excellent method for quantitative aerosol source apportionment in large urban areas.},

The model adjusts for spatio-temporal biases in the Eta CMAQ forecasts and avoids a change of support problem often encountered in data fusion settings where real data have been observed at point level monitoring sites, but the forecasts from the computer model are provided at grid cell levels. The model is validated with a large amount of set-aside data and is shown to provide much improved forecasts of daily O3 concentrations in the eastern United States.},

   abstract = {Decades of experience support the inclusion of odours in the list of contaminant types that must be regulated by government. In many jurisdictions, odour impacts are regulated under the nuisance provisions of common law. However, the explicit conditions that establish whether a nuisance condition exists are not easily defined. Due to this shortcoming, there is a need to introduce objectivity into odour impact assessments and odour limits. While individual responses to odours are highly variable and can result in a variety of effects, generally the impacts of odours arise from a variety of interacting factors, collectively known as FIDOL: frequency, intensity, duration, offensiveness, and location. In view of the need to prevent or mitigate such impacts, an approach to odour regulation is proposed in which the protection of the public from odour impacts is accomplished based on the FIDOL approach. This involves the introduction of an objective odour limit, as follows: “Facilities that are identified as sources of potentially offensive odours shall ensure that the 10-min average concentration of odour resulting from all sources at the facility and determined in accordance with accepted procedures, shall be less than 1 odour unit 99.5% of the time at the most impacted sensitive receptor”. It is argued that the proposed limit would provide the public with an understanding of the degree of protection from odours that is to be provided through regulations and would provide industries with a basis for designing their facilities to minimize impact at the design stage. Such limits would also provide industries with benchmarks against which they can gauge their success at preventing or mitigating odour impacts and for evaluating the effectiveness of odour control technologies.},

The obtained results showed the DFVs to emit higher amounts of PAHs than the GFVs per km driving distance at low average speed in the AU driving cycle, while the GFVs emitted higher amounts of PAHs than the DFVs per km driving distance at higher average speeds in the AR and AM driving cycles. Furthermore, the study showed an increase in PAH emissions per km driving distance with increasing average speed for the GFVs with the opposite trend found for the DFVs. The GFVs generated particulate matter with higher PAH content than the DFVs in all three driving cycles tested with the highest concentrations obtained in the AR driving cycle. Dibenzo(a,l)pyrene was found to be a major contributor to the potential carcinogenicity accounting for 58–67% and 25–31% of the sum added potential carcinogenicity of the measured PAHs in the emitted particulate matter from the DFVs and GFVs, respectively. Corresponding values for benzo(a)pyrene were 16–25% and 11–40% for the DFVs and GFVs, respectively. The DFVs displayed higher sum added potential carcinogenicity of the measured PAHs than the GFVs in the AU driving cycle with the opposite trend found in the AR and AM driving cycles. The findings of this study show the importance of including the dibenzopyrenes in vehicle exhaust chemical characterizations to avoid potential underestimation of the carcinogenic activity of the emissions. The lower emissions and the lower sum added potential carcinogenicity of the measured PAHs found in this study for the GFVs compared to the DFVs in the AU driving cycle indicate the GFVs to be preferred in dense urban areas with traffic moving at low average speeds with multiple start and stops. However, the obtained results suggest the opposite to be true at higher average speeds with driving at rural roads and motorways. Further studies are, however, needed to establish if the observed differences between GFVs and DFVs are generally valid as well as to study the effects on variations in vehicle/engine type, ambient temperature, fuel and driving conditions on the emission factors.},

For convenience, most primary schools are located near major roads. This study explores the exposure of acid aerosols for schoolchildren in areas in Taipei with different traffic densities. Acid aerosols were collected by using a honeycomb denuder filter pack sampling system (HDS). Experimental results indicated that the air pollutants were significantly correlated with traffic densities. The ambient air NO2, SO2, HNO3, NO3−, SO42−, and aerosol acidity concentrations were 31.3 ppb, 4.7 ppb, 1.3 ppb, 1.9 μg m−3, 18.5 μg m−3, and 49.5 nmol m−3 in high traffic density areas, and 6.1 ppb, 1.8 ppb, 0.9 ppb, 0.7 μg m−3, 8.8 μg m−3 and 14.7 nmol m−3 in low traffic density areas. The exposure levels of acid aerosols for schoolchildren would be higher than the measurements because the sampling height was 5 m above the ground. The SO2 levels were low (0.13–8.03 ppb) in the metropolitan Taipei. However, the SO42− concentrations were relatively high, and might be attributed to natural emissions of sulfur-rich geothermal sources. The seasonal variations of acid aerosol concentrations were also observed. The high levels of acidic particles in spring time may be attributed to the Asian dust storm and low height of the mixture layer. We conclude that automobile contributed not only the primary pollutants but also the secondary acid aerosols through the photochemical reaction. Schoolchildren were exposed to twice the acid aerosol concentrations in high traffic density areas compared to those in low traffic density areas. The incidence of allergic rhinitis of schoolchildren in the high traffic density areas was the highest in spring time. Accompanied by high temperature variation and high levels of air pollution in spring, the health risk of schoolchildren had been observed.},

We used the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model to examine the well-to-wheels (WTW) emissions of five criteria pollutants (VOCs, NOx, PM10, PM2.5, and CO) for nine vehicle/fuel systems: (1) conventional gasoline vehicles; (2) conventional diesel vehicles; (3) ethanol (E85) flexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs) fueled with corn-based ethanol; (4) E85 FFVs fueled with switchgrass-based ethanol; (5) gasoline hybrid vehicles (HEVs); (6) diesel HEVs; (7) electric vehicles (EVs) charged using the average U.S. generation mix; (8) EVs charged using the California generation mix; and (9) hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). Pollutant emissions were separated into total and urban emissions to differentiate the locations of emissions, and emissions were presented by sources. The results show that WTW emissions of the vehicle/fuel systems differ significantly, in terms of not only the amounts but also with respect to locations and sources, both of which are important in evaluating alternative vehicle/fuel systems. E85 FFVs increase total emissions but reduce urban emissions by up to 30% because the majority of emissions are released from farming equipment, fertilizer manufacture, and ethanol plants, all of which are located in rural areas. HEVs reduce both total and urban emissions because of the improved fuel economy and lower emissions. While EVs significantly reduce total emissions of VOCs and CO by more than 90%, they increase total emissions of PM10 and PM2.5 by 35–325%. However, EVs can reduce urban PM emissions by more than 40%. FCVs reduce VOCs, CO, and NOx emissions, but they increase both total and urban PM emissions because of the high process emissions that occur during hydrogen production. This study emphasizes the importance of specifying a thorough life-cycle emissions inventory that can account for both the locations and sources of the emissions to assist in achieving a fair comparison of alternative vehicle/fuel options in terms of their environmental impacts.},

   abstract = {As the world gets ready to begin the second decade of the twenty-first century, global climate change has been recognized as a real threat to civilization as we know it. The rapid and successful economic growth of developing nations, particularly China and India, is contributing to climate change. The route to initial economic success in China followed that of the developed nations through the development of industries. Unfortunately, China's environmental protection efforts have not been the same as in developed countries because China is vastly different culturally, socially, economically and, especially, politically from developed nations. When China started to deal with environmental concerns in the late 1970s, it took advantage of the experiences of other countries in establishing environmental standards and regulations, but it did not have a model to follow when it came to implementing these standards and regulations because of the abovementioned differences. Economically, China is transitioning from an agricultural base into an industrial base; however, even now, 60% of the population remains farmers. China has been and still is heavily dependent upon coal for energy, resulting in serious atmospheric particulate pollution. While growing efforts have been expended on the environment, at this juncture of its economic development, China would be well served to revisit the traditional “develop first and clean up later” approach and to find a balance between development and protecting the environment. Against this backdrop, a reflective look of the effort to manage air quality from 1949–2008 (with an emphasis on the past 30years) in China is presented in this paper. The environmental component of the 2008 Olympic Games is examined as a special example to illustrate the current measures being used to improve air quality in China.},

   abstract = {A major issue in air pollution epidemiology is whether the associations that are found in the statistical analyses on the health effects of air pollution reflect real causal associations of single components or mixtures thereof, or just reflect statistical associations that are mainly the result of the high correlation between the separate components, one of them being the true causal factor. In a previous analysis on the relationship between daily SO2 levels and daily mortality in The Netherlands [Buringh, E., Fischer, P., Hoek, G., 2000. Is SO2 a causative factor for the PM-associated mortality risks in The Netherlands? Inhal. Toxicol. 12 (Suppl. 1), 55–60.], it was shown that the statistical significant association between daily variation in SO2 and daily mortality did not reflect a causal relation. Black Smoke levels in The Netherlands have decreased 4-fold during the 34 years in the period 1972–2006 (annual average from 27μgm−3 to 6μgm−3). This large decrease in concentrations enabled us to use the same approach for this component as was done earlier for SO2 to assess whether a decreasing trend in Black Smoke levels in The Netherlands is associated with an increasing trend in mortality relative risks or not. We used daily averaged Black Smoke (BS) data from 1972 to 2006. In the first two decades (1970–1990) only sparse data were available. Based on the availability of the data, we selected data from 1972 to 1974 and from 1982 to 1984 because during these two periods continuous daily measurement series were available. For the later years (1989–2006) data covering the whole of The Netherlands were available, giving a total of 24 years of daily data. Data on daily total mortality counts (excluding external causes), cardiovascular mortality and respiratory mortality for the whole population of The Netherlands were analyzed with regard to daily Black Smoke levels using generalized additive Poisson regression models (GAM). Period specific relative risk estimates were compared and differences in estimates between periods were evaluated. We found no consistent increase in relative risks for daily total and cause-specific mortality over time, despite the decreasing trend in the Black Smoke levels in The Netherlands. Average relative risks for total mortality varied over the different periods from 0.997 per 10μgm−3 daily Black Smoke to 1.010 per 10μgm−3. Average relative risks for cardiovascular mortality varied from 0.988 per 10μgm−3 to 1.010 per 10μgm−3 and for respiratory mortality from 1.000 to 1.010 per 10μgm−3. For weekly averaged concentrations the average relative risks for total mortality varied over the different periods from 1.004 per 10μgm−3 Black Smoke to 1.018 per 10μgm−3. Average relative risks for cardiovascular mortality varied from 1.003 per 10μgm−3 to 1.016 per 10 μgm−3 and for respiratory mortality from 1.000 to 1.050 per 10μgm−3. The result of our analyses suggests that Black Smoke cannot be excluded as a potential causal agent because relative risks over time show no increasing trend despite the decreasing trend in Black Smoke concentrations.},

   abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution has been linked to adverse health impacts, and combustion sources including residential wood-burning may play an important role in some regions. Recent evidence suggests that indoor air quality may improve in homes where older, non-certified wood stoves are exchanged for lower emissions EPA-certified alternatives. As part of a wood stove exchange program in northern British Columbia, Canada, we sampled outdoor and indoor air at 15 homes during 6-day sampling sessions both before and after non-certified wood stoves were exchanged. During each sampling session two consecutive 3-day PM2.5 samples were collected onto Teflon filters, which were weighed and analyzed for the wood smoke tracer levoglucosan. Residential PM2.5 infiltration efficiencies (Finf) were estimated from continuous light scattering measurements made with nephelometers, and estimates of Finf were used to calculate the outdoor- and indoor-generated contributions to indoor air. There was not a consistent relationship between stove technology and outdoor or indoor concentrations of PM2.5 or levoglucosan. Mean Finf estimates were low and similar during pre- and post-exchange periods (0.32 ± 0.17 and 0.33 ± 0.17, respectively). Indoor sources contributed the majority (∼65%) of the indoor PM2.5 concentrations, independent of stove technology, although low indoor-outdoor levoglucosan ratios (median ≤ 0.19) and low indoor PM2.5-levoglucosan correlations (r ≤ 0.19) suggested that wood smoke was not a major indoor PM2.5 source in most of these homes. In summary, despite the potential for extensive wood stove exchange programs to reduce outdoor PM2.5 concentrations in wood smoke-impacted communities, we did not find a consistent relationship between stove technology upgrades and indoor air quality improvements in homes where stoves were exchanged.},

   abstract = {Aerosols are harmful to human health and have both direct and indirect effects on climate. China is a major contributor to global emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), a sulfate (SO42−) precursor, organic carbon (OC), and black carbon (BC) aerosols. Although increasingly examined, the effect of present and potential future levels of these emissions on global premature mortality and climate change has not been well quantified. Through both direct radiative effects and indirect effects on clouds, SO42− and OC exert negative radiative forcing (cooling) while BC exerts positive forcing (warming). We analyze the effect of China's emissions of SO2, SO42−, OC and BC in 2000 and for three emission scenarios in 2030 on global surface aerosol concentrations, premature mortality, and radiative forcing (RF). Using global models of chemical transport (MOZART-2) and radiative transfer (GFDL RTM), and combining simulation results with gridded population data, mortality rates, and concentration–response relationships from the epidemiological literature, we estimate the contribution of Chinese aerosols to global annual premature mortality and to RF in 2000 and 2030. In 2000, we estimate these aerosols cause approximately 470 000 premature deaths in China and an additional 30 000 deaths globally. In 2030, aggressive emission controls lead to a 50% reduction in premature deaths from the 2000 level to 240 000 in China and 10 000 elsewhere, while under a high emissions scenario premature deaths increase 50% from the 2000 level to 720 000 in China and to 40 000 elsewhere. Because the negative RF from SO42− and OC is larger than the positive forcing from BC, Chinese aerosols lead to global net direct RF of −74mWm−2 in 2000 and between −15 and −97mWm−2 in 2030 depending on the emissions scenario. Our analysis indicates that increased effort to reduce greenhouse gases is essential to address climate change as China's anticipated reduction of aerosols will result in the loss of net negative radiative forcing.},

Particle number–size distributions were measured in the diameter range Dp=3–800nm and hygroscopic properties were determined at initial dry particle diameters of Dpj (j=30, 50, 80, 150, 250, and 350nm) at a relative humidity (RH) of 90%. Hygroscopic properties were compared with chemical analyses of aerosol samples taken with the MOUDI. Based on the hygroscopicity data, the total hygroscopic particle volume was modeled, including dependence on dry particle size, season and level of pollution using a simple approach. Overall, the chemical analysis showed ammonium sulfate to be the major inorganic component of the urban submicrometer aerosol in Beijing along with relatively high fractions of elemental carbon (10–25%) and organic matter (15–60%) depending on particle size and season. The hygroscopic growth distributions (H-TDMA) subdivided the aerosol population into three different groups of particles with varying growth factors depending on dry particle size, namely nearly hydrophobic (growth factor=0.96–1.07), less hygroscopic (1.06–1.29) and more hygroscopic (1.26–1.62). Hydrophobic particle fractions indicating freshly emitted soot/carbonaceous particles varied between 10 and 32% depending on dry particle size and season. During heavily polluted times, a decreasing number of hydrophobic particle fractions indicated that the urban submicrometer aerosol in Beijing was highly influenced by more aged aerosol transported from the industrial regions around Beijing containing sulfate as a major component. Based on model calculations, the urban submicrometer aerosol in Beijing showed strong compositional variations. The calculated total hygroscopic volume fractions varied between 16 and 65% depending on size, level of pollution and season.},

   abstract = {Background
In the UK air quality has been monitored systematically since 1914, providing valuable data for studies of the long-term trends in air pollution and potentially for studies of health effects of air pollutants. There are, however, challenges in interpreting these data due to changes over time in the number and location of monitored sites, and in monitoring techniques. Particulate matter was measured as deposited matter (DM) using deposit gauge monitors until the 1950s when black smoke (BS) filters were introduced. Estimating long-term exposure to particulates using data from both deposit gauge and BS monitors requires an understanding of the relationships between DM, SO2 and BS.
Aims
To explore whether DM and/or SO2, along with seasonal and location specific variables can be used to predict BS levels.
Methods
Air quality data were abstracted from hard copies of the monthly Atmospheric Pollution Bulletins for the period April 1956–March 1961 for any sites with co-located DM, SO2 and BS data for three or more consecutive years. The relationships between DM, SO2, and BS were assessed using mixed models.
Results
There were 34 eligible sites giving 1521 triplets of data. There was a consistent correlation between SO2 and BS at all sites, but the association between DM and BS was less clear and varied by location. Mixed modelling allowing for repeat measurements at each site revealed that SO2, year, rainfall and season of measurement explained 72% of the variability in BS levels.
Conclusions
SO2 can be used as a surrogate measure for BS in all monitoring locations. This surrogate can be improved upon by consideration of site specific characteristics, seasonal effects, rainfall and year of measurement. These findings will help in estimating historic, long-term exposure to particulates where BS or other measures are not available.},

   abstract = {In the beginning of the 21st century, it is obvious that health and environmental matters are among the most important political and societal topics. The various kinds of pollution (e.g. air pollution, soil pollution, water contamination) are responsible for significant health and environmental degradation. In order to adequately deal with pollution issues, it is important to better understand the acting processes and to be able to account for specific knowledge about the pollutant. Thanks to this, it will be possible to forecast pollutant concentrations so that efficient actions can be rapidly taken. Based on a Bayesian data fusion (BDF) framework, the present paper proposes a methodology for air pollutant forecasting using the space–time properties of the process and several secondary information sources that contribute to a better understanding of the pollutant behavior (e.g. meteorological variables and anthropogenic activities). Consequently, the present work can contribute to improving the representation and the forecast of pollutant fields. Moreover the developed approach also permits to predict the probability of exceeding a given threshold, as required in official regulations for some pollutants (e.g. the European directives). The BDF framework is applied here to the case of space–time predictions of air concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in Belgium. After a detailed description of some specific assumptions, results showed that BDF is able to successfully account for secondary information sources, thus leading to meaningful NO2 predictions.},

The Denver Aerosol Sources and Health (DASH) study was designed to identify the sources of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) that are most responsible for the adverse health effects of short-term exposure to PM2.5. Daily 24-h PM2.5 sampling began in July 2002 at a residential monitoring site in Denver, Colorado, using both Teflon and quartz filter samplers. Sampling is planned to continue through 2008. Chemical speciation is being carried out for mass, inorganic ionic compounds (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium), and carbonaceous components, including elemental carbon, organic carbon, temperature-resolved organic carbon fractions and a large array of organic compounds. In addition, water-soluble metals were measured daily for 12 months in 2003. A receptor-based source apportionment approach utilizing positive matrix factorization (PMF) will be used to identify PM2.5 source contributions for each 24-h period. Based on a preliminary assessment using synthetic data, the proposed source apportionment should be able to identify many important sources on a daily basis, including secondary ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate, diesel vehicle exhaust, road dust, wood combustion and vegetative debris. Meat cooking, gasoline vehicle exhaust and natural gas combustion were more challenging for PMF to accurately identify due to high detection limits for certain organic molecular marker compounds. Measurements of these compounds are being improved and supplemented with additional organic molecular marker compounds. The health study will investigate associations between daily source contributions and an array of health endpoints, including daily mortality and hospitalizations and measures of asthma control in asthmatic children. Findings from the DASH study, in addition to being of interest to policymakers, by identifying harmful PM2.5 sources may provide insights into mechanisms of PM effect.},

These airborne bioaerosols can induce irritational, allergic, infectious, and chemical responses in exposed individuals. Three separate sites were monitored, samples were collected and analyzed for mass and biological content (endotoxins, (1,3)-β-d-glucan and protein). Concentrations of these bioaerosols were reported as a function of PM size fraction, mass and volume of air sampled. The results indicated that higher concentrations of biologicals were present in PM10 than were present in PM2.5, except when near-roadway conditions existed. This study provides the characterization of ambient bioaerosol concentrations in a variety of areas and conditions.},

Local air pollution sources also contributed to the observed particle levels during these episodes.

   abstract = {Lanzhou is one of the most air-polluted cities in China and in the world, and its primary air pollutant is particulate matter (PM). Different size particulate matter (TSP, PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0) have different sources and affect the environment and human health differently, so it is very important to study the pollutant characteristics of different particles in order to deeply understand the pollution situation of Lanzhou city and establish reasonable preventive countermeasures. TSP, PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0 concentrations were simultaneously measured in Lanzhou to detect the annual and diurnal variations of concentrations of PM with different sizes and possible causes. The main results are as follows: (1) The annual distribution of monthly average concentrations for coarse particles (TSP and PM10) is bimodal with the highest peak in April, which is different from the situation in other cities not affected by sand-dust events. However, the annual distribution for fine particles (PM2.5 and PM1.0) is unimodal with the peak in December. This difference between coarse and fine particles indicates that sand-dust events in spring carry much more coarse than fine particles to Lanzhou. This result is supported by the correlation between springtime wind speed and concentrations of PM with different sizes. (2) Under normal conditions (without dust intrusions), the diurnal distribution of coarse particle concentration in Lanzhou is bimodal. However, the distribution is trimodal during dust intrusions in April, with an extra peak in the afternoon. (3) In general, the highest concentration peaks of the diurnal variations for TSP, PM10, PM2.5 and PM1.0 occur at about the same time. However, there are obvious differences in the occurrence time of the minimum concentrations among different kinds of PM. The differences in the occurrence time of minima between coarse and fine particles are due to their different diffusion behaviors in the atmospheric boundary layer.},

   abstract = {This study explores the appropriateness of the locality of air monitoring stations which are meant to indicate air quality in the area. Daily variations in NO2 and PM10 concentrations at 14 monitoring stations in Hong Kong are examined. The daily variations in NO2 at a number of background monitoring stations exhibit patterns similar to variations in traffic volume while variations in PM10 concentration exhibit less discernible pattern. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) are applied to analyse NO2 and PM10 measurements between January 2001 and December 2005. The results show that NO2 concentrations at background stations within the urban area are highly influenced by vehicle emissions. The effect vehicle emission has on NO2 at stations within new towns is smaller. CA results also show that variations in PM10 concentrations are distinguished by the area the station is located in. PCA results show that there are two principal components (PC's) associated with variations in roadside concentration of PM10. The strong influence of roadside emissions towards concentrations of NO2 and PM10 at a number of urban background stations may be due to their close proximity to busy roadways and the high density of surrounding tall buildings, which creates an enclosure that hinders dispersion of roadside emissions and results in air pollution behaviour that reflects variation in traffic.},

   abstract = {Average 21st century concentrations of urban air pollutants linked to cardiorespiratory disease are not declining, and commonly exceed legal limits. Even below such limits, health effects are being observed and may be related to transient daytime peaks in pollutant concentrations. With this in mind, we analyse >52,000 hourly urban background readings of PM10 and pollutant gases throughout 2007 at a European town with legal annual average concentrations of common pollutants, but with a documented air pollution-related cardiorespiratory health problem, and demonstrate the hourly variations in PM10, SO2, NOx, CO and O3. Back-trajectory analysis was applied to track the arrival of exotic PM10 intrusions, the main controls on air pollutants were identified, and the typical hourly pattern on ambient concentrations during 2007 was profiled. Emphasis was placed on “worst case” data (>90th percentile), when health effects are likely to be greatest. The data show marked daytime variations in pollutants result from rush-hour traffic-related pollution spikes, midday industrial SO2 maxima, and afternoon O3 peaks. African dust intrusions enhance PM10 levels at whatever hour, whereas European PM incursions produce pronounced evening peaks due to their transport direction (across an industrial traffic corridor). Transient peak profiling moves us closer to the reality of personal outdoor exposure to inhalable pollutants in a given urban area. We argue that such an approach to monitoring data potentially offers more to air pollution health effect studies than using only 24 h or annual averages.},

   abstract = {It is now well understood that air pollution produces significant adverse health effects in the general public and over the past 60 years, there have been on-going efforts to reduce the emitted pollutants and their resulting health effects. There are now shifting patterns of industrialization with many heavily polluting industries moving from developed countries with increasingly stringent air quality standards to the developing world. However, even in decreasing concentrations of pollutants, health effects remain important possibly as a result of changes in the nature of the pollutants as new chemicals are produced and as other causes of mortality and morbidity are reduced. In addition, there is now the potential for deliberate introduction of toxic air pollutants by local armed conflicts and terrorists. Thus, there are new challenges to understand the role of the atmospheric environment on public health in this time of changing economic and demographic conditions overlaid with the willingness to indirectly attack governments and other established entities through direct attacks on the general public.},

   abstract = {Air pollution in the industrialised world has in the last 50 years undergone drastic changes. Until after World War II the most important urban compound was sulphur dioxide combined with soot from the use of fossil fuels in heat and power production. When that problem was partly solved by cleaner fuels, higher stacks and flue gas cleaning in urban areas, the growing traffic gave rise to nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds and in some areas photochemical air pollution, which may be abated by catalytic converters. Lately the interest has centred on small particles and more exotic organic compounds that can be detected with new sophisticated analytical techniques. Simultaneously with the development in compounds, the time and geographical scale of interest have increased. First to transboundary air pollution, which in decades and on continents can degrade ecosystems, later to the depletion of the ozone layer and especially to the increasing greenhouse effect with climate change that will change the conditions for nature and mankind on the entire globe. The possibilities to study these large scale phenomena have been greatly enhanced by the development of electronic computers that can handle large data sets and calculate various scenarios. All these processes take place in the thin layer of gases around the Earth, the atmosphere. Although the abatement is often restricted to a single aspect, they are often connected and should when possible be treated as whole.},

Multiply-replicated cytotoxicity (in vitro) assays utilizing a human epithelial (lung model) cell line (A549) consistently demonstrated varying degrees of cell death for essentially all PM which was characterized as aggregates of nanoparticulates or primary nanoparticles. Cytokine release was detected for Fe2O3, chrysotile asbestos, BC, and MWCNT PM while reactive oxygen species (ROS) production has been detected for Fe2O3, asbestos, BC, and MWCNT aggregate PM as well as natural gas combustion PM.

   abstract = {This paper evaluates the ranking of 21 priority air pollutants with three indicator schemes: environmental pressure indicator (EPI), environmental quality indicator (EQI), and human health effect indicator (HEI). The EPI and EQI compare the emissions and concentrations with the target emissions and target concentrations, respectively. The HEI comprehends the steps from cause (i.e. national emissions) to effect (i.e. human health effects), and is the total human health burden, expressed in Disability Adjusted Life Years per year of exposure (DALYsyear−1). We estimated a health burden in the Netherlands of 41×103DALYsyear−1 caused by Dutch air emissions of PM10 and its precursors in the year 2003. The burden due to 17 carcinogenic substances emitted to air, was much lower (140DALYsyear−1). In contrast, when the same substances were evaluated regarding environmental pressure and environmental quality, carbon tetrachloride (pressure) and benzo[a]pyrene (quality) were of highest importance, whereas the importance of PM10 was substantially lower. This result is remarkable, because for the majority of substances evaluated, the target concentrations and target emissions are based on preventing human health damage. The differences in relevance are explained by the different weighting of interests in the indicators. The HEI is based on concentration–response relations, whereas the EPI and EQI also depend on other, policy-based, principles and on technical feasibility. Therefore, to effectively prioritize emission reduction measures in policy-making, substances should not only be evaluated as to whether emission targets and environmental quality targets are reached, but they should be evaluated regarding their human health impact as well. In this context, the HEI is a suitable indicator to evaluate the human health impact.},

Aerosol mass concentrations were up to 2 times higher during the particulate matter (PM) events than on normal days (NDs), and all types of PM led to decreased visibility. Water-soluble ions (Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, F−, Cl−, NO3−, and SO42−). were major aerosol components during the pollution episodes, but their concentrations were lower during DSs. NH4+, K+, F−, Cl−, NO3−, and SO42− were more abundant in PM2.5 than TSP but the opposite was true for Mg2+ and Ca2+. PM collected on hazy days was enriched with secondary species (NH4+, NO3−, and SO42) while PM from straw combustion showed high K+ and Cl−. Firework displays caused increases in K+ and also enrichments of NO3− relative to SO42−. During DSs, the concentrations of secondary aerosol components were low, but Ca2+ was abundant. Ion balance calculations indicate that PM from haze and straw combustion was acidic while the DSs samples were alkaline and the fireworks' PM was close to neutral. Ion ratios (SO42−/K+, NO3−/SO42−, and Cl−/K+) proved effective as indicators for different pollution episodes.},

A total of 1353 roadside dust samples were collected from Seoul, Korea for 13 months. Thermomagnetic data and intensive electron microscopy identified a predominance of carbon-bearing iron-oxides, indicating that anthropogenic particulates mostly originated from fossil fuel combustions. To quantify anthropogenic particulates, an apparent magnetic concentration [AMCFe3O4=observed saturation magnetization(Ms)/MsofFe3O4(=92.36Am2kg−1)] was calculated. AMCFe3O4 showed distinctive spatial and seasonal dependences: highest in industrial areas and lowest in park areas; and maximum in winter and minimum in summer. Seasonal mapping using AMCFe3O4 illustrated that industries in southwestern Seoul were the major pollution source. In addition, dominant westerly winds possibly transported pollutants along topographically lower areas in Seoul.},

   abstract = {Background
This study examines perceived health effect risks from air pollution during the work-related commute by socio-demographic and travel mode variables.
Methods
Population-representative survey data were collected by telephone from 745 adults from Queensland, Australia. Variables assessed included socio-demographics, usual work travel mode, commute perceptions, and perceived health effects associated with air pollution during the work-related commute.
Results
Approximately 45% of the sample perceived air pollution negatively affected health outcomes when commuting to/from work, yet only 13% recognised air pollution as a major barrier to walking or cycling to/from work. No relationships existed between usual travel mode to/from work and perceived health risks associated with air pollution. Those higher educated or living in major cities were more likely to recognise air pollution harmed their health during their work-related commute when compared to respective referent categories (p ≤ 0.05).
Conclusions
Recognition of health risks from air pollution during the work-related commute was high, and awareness did not differ by travel mode. For the majority, air pollution was not a primary barrier for walking or cycling to/from work.},

   abstract = {Mortality is the most important health effect of ambient air pollution and has been studied the longest. The earliest evidence relates to fog episodes but with the development of more precise methods of investigation it is still possible to discern short-term temporal associations with daily mortality at the historically low levels of air pollution that now exist in most developed countries. Another early observation was that mortality was higher in more polluted areas. This has been confirmed by modern cohort studies that account for other potential explanations for such associations. There does not appear to be a threshold of effect within the ambient range of concentrations. Advances in the understanding of air pollution and mortality have been driven by the combined development of methods and biomedical concepts. The most influential methodological developments have been in time-series techniques and the establishment of large cohort studies, both of which are underpinned by advances in data processing and statistical analysis. On the biomedical side two important developments can be identified. One has been the application of the concept of multifactorial disease causation to explaining how air pollution may affect mortality at low levels and why thresholds are not obvious at the population level. The other has been an increasing understanding of how air pollution may plausibly have pathophysiological effects that are remote from the lung interface with ambient air. Together, these advances have had a profound influence on policies to protect public health. Throughout the history of air pollution epidemiology, mortality studies have been central and this will continue because of the widespread availability of mortality data on a large population scale and the weight that mortality carries in estimating impacts for policy development.},

   abstract = {Changes over recent decades in outdoor concentrations of air pollutants are well documented. However, the impacts of air pollution on an individual's health actually relate not to these outdoor concentrations but to their personal exposure in the different locations in which they spend time. Assessing how personal exposures differ from outdoor concentrations, and how they have changed over recent decades, is challenging. This review focuses on the exposure of children, since they are a particularly sensitive group. Much of children's time is spent indoors, and childhood exposure is closely related to concentrations in the home, at school, and in transport. For this reason, children's personal exposures to air pollutants differ significantly from both those of adults and from outdoor concentrations. They depend on a range of factors, including urbanisation, energy use, building design, travel patterns, and activity profiles; analysis of these factors can identify a wider range of policy measures to reduce children's exposure than direct emission control. There is a very large variation in personal exposure between individual children, caused by differences in building design, indoor and outdoor sources, and activity patterns. Identifying groups of children with high personal exposure, and their underlying causes, is particularly important in regions of the world where emissions are increasing, but there are limited resources for environmental and health protection. Although the science of personal exposure assessment, with the associated measurement and modelling techniques, has developed to maturity in North America and western Europe over the last 50 years, there is an urgent need to apply this science in other parts of the world where the effects of air pollution are now much more serious.},

An integrated modelling approach is presented which utilises air dispersion (ADMS-Urban) and particulate interception (UFORE) to predict the PM10 concentrations both before and after greenspace establishment, using a 10 × 10 km area of East London Green Grid (ELGG) as a case study. The corresponding health benefits, in terms of premature mortality and respiratory hospital admissions, as a result of the reduced exposure of the local population are also modelled. PM10 capture from the scenario comprising 75% grassland, 20% sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and 5% Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) was estimated to be 90.41 t yr−1, equating to 0.009 t ha−1 yr−1 over the whole study area. The human health modelling estimated that 2 deaths and 2 hospital admissions would be averted per year.},

This paper describes a unique study in which European flounder (Platichthys flesus) were chronically (8 months) exposed to bis(tri-n-butyltin)oxide (TBTO) in the water under controlled laboratory conditions. Residue levels in selected tissues (liver, muscle) and general health status indices were measured and the effects on several organs (gills, liver, mesonephros, ovary/testis, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract) were examined histopathologically. Additionally, morphometric analysis of the thymus was performed. The major finding is that exposure of flounder to 5 μg TBTO/l over a period of 8 months, resulting in body burdens comparable to high field levels, induced significant reduction of thymus volume, possibly affecting immunocompetence of the animals. Chronic exposure of European flounder to tributyltin is therefore likely to affect the general health status of this species in heavily polluted aquatic environments.},

Many models exhibited thresholds (25–45 μm g/m3 for PM10, and 10–45 ppb for O3). Our preliminary exploratory analyses suggest that the use of a linear, no threshold, model for pollution studies is not consistent with the observed data.

   abstract = {Objective
As a result of the California heat wave in July 2006, county coroners reported that the high temperatures during that period caused approximately 147 deaths. However, heat wave-related deaths are likely to be underreported due to a lack of a clear case definition and the multi-factorial nature of heat-related mortality. Public health policy suggests a need for a careful assessment of mortality following a heat wave. In addition, it is useful to provide a comparison of the mortality impact per degree change during heat waves versus high temperatures observed during non-heat wave periods.
Design
Daily data were collected for mortality, weather and ozone in seven California counties impacted by the July 2006 heat wave. The association between apparent temperature and daily mortality was assessed using a Poisson regression model and combined across counties in a meta-analysis. These results were then used to estimate the increases in the number of deaths during the heat wave.
Results
Our analysis indicated that during the July heat wave, there was a 9% (95% CI=1.6, 16.3) increase in daily mortality per 10° Fahrenheit (F) change in apparent temperature for all counties combined. This estimate is almost 3 times larger than the effect estimated for the full warm season of May–September, during the non-heat wave years. Our estimates also determined that actual mortality during the July 2006 heat wave was 2–3 times greater than the coroner estimates.
Conclusion
This multi-county analysis provides additional evidence that the attributable risk of mortality following a heat wave may be underestimated by examining only direct heat-related deaths. In addition, we have found that the mortality effect per °F is several times higher than that reported during non-heat wave periods.},

The purpose of this laboratory study was to examine the aerosolization of culturable and total fungi, (1→3)-β-d glucan, and endotoxin from eight flood-affected floor and bedding materials collected in New Orleans homes, following Hurricane Katrina. Aerosolization was examined using the Fungal Spore Source Strength Tester (FSSST) connected to a BioSampler. Dust samples were collected by vacuuming. A two-stage cyclone sampler was used for size-selective analysis of aerosolized glucan and endotoxin. On average, levels of culturable fungi ranged from undetectable (lower limit=8.3×104) to 2.6×105CFU/m2; total fungi ranged from 2.07×105 to 1.6×106spores/m2; (1→3)-β-d glucan and endotoxin were 2.0×103–2.9×104ng/m2 and 7.0×102–9.3×104EU/m2, respectively. The results showed that 5–15min sampling is sufficient for detecting aerosolizable biocontaminants with the FSSST. Smaller particle size fractions (<1.0 and <1.8μm) have levels of glucan and endotoxin comparable to larger (>1.8μm) fractions, which raises additional exposure concerns. Vacuuming was found to overestimate inhalation exposure risks by a factor of approximately 102 for (1→3)-β-d glucan and by 103–104 for endotoxin as detected by the FSSST. The information generated from this study is important with respect to restoration and rejuvenation of the flood-affected areas in New Orleans. We believe the findings will be significant during similar disasters in other regions of the world including major coastal floods from tsunamis.},

We investigated effects of chronic exposure (2 months) to ambient levels of particulate matter (PM) on development of protease-induced emphysema and pulmonary remodeling in mice. Methods: Balb/c mice received nasal drop of either papain or normal saline and were kept in two exposure chambers situated in an area with high traffic density. One of them received ambient air and the other had filters for PM. Results: mean concentration of PM10 was 2.68±0.38 and 33.86±2.09μg/m3, respectively, in the filtered and ambient air chambers (p<0.001). After 2 months of exposure, lungs from papain-treated mice kept in the chamber with ambient air presented greater values of mean linear intercept, an increase in density of collagen fibers in alveolar septa and in expression of 8-isoprostane (p=0.002, p<0.05 and p=0.002, respectively, compared to papain-treated mice kept in the chamber with filtered air). We did not observe significant differences between these two groups in density of macrophages and in amount of cells expressing matrix metalloproteinase-12. There were no significant differences in saline-treated mice kept in the two chambers.
Conclusions
We conclude that exposure to urban levels of PM worsens protease-induced emphysema and increases pulmonary remodeling. We suggest that an increase in oxidative stress induced by PM exposure influences this response. These pulmonary effects of PM were observed only in mice with emphysema.},

Wild game hunting is a popular activity in many regions of the United States. Recently, the presence of lead fragments in wild game meat, presumably from the bullets or shot used for hunting, has raised concerns about health risks from meat consumption.
Objective
This study examined the association between blood lead levels (PbB) and wild game consumption.
Methods
We recruited 742 participants, aged 2–92 years, from six North Dakota cities. Blood lead samples were collected from 736 persons. Information on socio-demographic background, housing, lead exposure source, and types of wild game consumption (i.e., venison, other game such as moose, birds) was also collected. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to determine the association between PbB and wild game consumption.
Results
Most participants reported consuming wild game (80.8%) obtained from hunting (98.8%). The geometric mean PbB were 1.27 and 0.84μg/dl among persons who did and did not consume wild game, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, persons who consumed wild game had 0.30μg/dl (95% confidence interval: 0.16–0.44μg/dl) higher PbB than persons who did not. For all game types, recent (<1 month) wild game consumption was associated with higher PbB. PbB was also higher among those who consumed a larger serving size (≥2oz vs. <2oz); however, this association was significant for ‘other game’ consumption only.
Conclusions
Participants who consumed wild game had higher PbB than those who did not consume wild game. Careful review of butchering practices and monitoring of meat-packing processes may decrease lead exposure from wild game consumption.},

   abstract = {Introduction
Fine particles (PM2.5) are an important component of air pollution. Epidemiological studies have shown health effects due to ambient air particles, particularly allergies in children. Since the main difficulty is to determine exposure to such pollution, traffic air pollutant (TAP) dispersions models have been developed to improve the estimation of individual exposure levels. One such model, the ExTra index, has been validated for nitrogen oxide concentrations but not for other pollutants. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity of the ExTra index to assess PM2.5 exposure.
Methods
We compared PM2.5 concentrations calculated by the ExTra index to reference measures (passive samplers situated under the covered part of the playground), in 15 schools in Bordeaux, in 2000. First, we collected the input data required by the ExTra index: background and local pollution depending on traffic, meteorology and topography. Second, the ExTra index was calculated for each school. Statistical analysis consisted of a graphic description; then, we calculated an intraclass correlation coefficient.
Results
Concentrations calculated with the ExTra index and the reference method were similar. The ExTra index underestimated exposure by 2.2μgm−3 on average compared to the reference method. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.85 and its 95% confidence interval was [0.62; 0.95].
Conclusions
The results suggest that the ExTra index provides an assessment of PM2.5 exposure similar to that of the reference method. Although caution is required in interpreting these results owing to the small number of sites, the ExTra index could be a useful epidemiological tool for reconstructing individual exposure, an important challenge in epidemiology.},

To evaluate the relationship between the level of PM2.5 measured over 48h in the second trimester of pregnancy with those in the first and the third trimesters, a series of repeated measurements in each trimester was carried out in a random subsample of 85 pregnant women. We assessed the effect of PM2.5 exposure on the birth outcomes (weight, length and head circumference at birth) by multivariable regression models, controlling for potential confounders (maternal education, gestational age, parity, maternal height and prepregnancy weight, sex of infant, prenatal environmental tobacco smoke, and season of birth). Birth outcomes were associated positively with gestational age, parity, maternal height and prepregnancy weight, but negatively with the level of prenatal PM2.5 exposure. Overall average increase in gestational period of prenatal exposure to fine particles by about 30μg/m3, i.e., from 25th percentile (23.4μg/m3) to 75th percentile (53.1μg/m3) brought about an average birth weight deficit of 97.2g (95% CI: −201, 6.6) and length at birth of 0.7cm (95% CI: −1.36, −0.04). The corresponding exposure lead to birth weight deficit in male newborns of 189g (95% CI: −34.2, −343) in comparison to 17g in female newborns; the deficit of length at birth in male infants amounted to 1.1cm (95% CI: −0.11, −2.04). We found a significant interrelationship between self-reported ETS and PM2.5, however, none of the models showed a significant interaction of both variables. The joint effect of various levels of PM2.5 and ETS on birth outcomes showed the significant deficit only for the categories of exposure with higher component of PM2.5. Concluding, the results of the study suggest that observed deficits in birth outcomes are rather attributable to prenatal PM2.5 exposure and not to environmental tobacco smoke. The study also provided evidence that male fetuses are more sensitive to prenatal PM2.5 exposure and this should persuade policy makers to consider birth outcomes by gender separately while setting air pollution guidelines.},

   abstract = {Trees are considered producers of allergenic pollen. The aims of this work were to characterize the aerobiology of the Platanus, Acer, Salix, Quercus, Betula and Populus pollen, linking it with monthly emergency hospital admissions and to identify the different reactivity levels in sensitized patients. This information would be of great importance to evaluate the convenience of changing the inventory of pollen producer trees related to the risk of allergenic reactions. The study was conducted in Porto, Portugal, from 2005 to 2007. Airborne pollen was sampled using a Hirst-type volumetric trap. The antigenic and allergenic properties of Acer negundo, Betula pendula, Platanus occidentalis, Populus hybrida, Quercus robur and Salix babylonica pollen, collected in public gardens or sidewalks, were investigated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunological techniques using polysensitized-patient sera. Monthly hospital admissions of asthma or dyspnea related with respiratory diseases were obtained from the Emergency Room database of Hospital Geral de Santo António. Tree pollen and hospital admissions were positively correlated. Tree pollen peaked in March which coincides with the hospital admissions maximum. The highest binding affinity was observed with A. negundo, S. babylonica and P. occidentalis pollen extracts and the lowest with P. hybrida. Consistently, Acer and Platanus maximum airborne pollen concentrations were observed during March attaining levels considered moderate to high risk for allergenic reactions. Prominent bands with approximately 71, 35, 31, 22, 19, 16, 14, 13 and 11kDa were revealed. A 52kDa band was shared by all analyzed sera. High levels of airborne pollen and emergency hospital admissions were related. High binding affinity of specific IgE to pollen extracts of the most abundant tree pollen present in the atmosphere was observed. Patient sera revealed multiple similar allergenic bands shared by the different extracts. This multidisciplinary approach is useful in day-to-day medical practice to help in diagnostic, therapeutic and allergy alerting system adjusting.},

Unlike most CBPR projects that are single topic-focused, our ‘holistic’, systems-based project targeted five priorities. The three research-focused/action-oriented components were: (1) participatory monitoring of indoor and outdoor pollution; (2) learning about health needs and concerns of residents through community-based listening sessions; (3) engaging in collaborative survey work, including a household vulnerability survey and an asthma prevalence survey for schoolchildren. The two action-focused/research-informed components were: (4) tackling persistent street trash and illegal dumping strategically; and (5) educating and empowering youth to promote environmental justice. We used a coupled CBPR-capacity building approach to design, vulnerability theory to frame, and mixed methods: quantitative environmental testing and qualitative surveys. Process and outcomes yielded important lessons: vulnerability theory helps frame issues holistically; having several topic-based projects yielded useful information, but was hard to manage and articulate to the public; access to, and engagement with, the target population was very difficult and would have benefited greatly from having representative residents who were paid at the partners’ table. Engagement with residents and conflict burden varied highly across components. Notwithstanding, we built enabling capacity, strengthened our understanding of vulnerability, and are able to share valuable experiential knowledge.},

Brain inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Hypothesizing therefore that long-term exposure to fine PM might contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the objective of this study was to investigate the association between exposure to fine PM and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which is associated with a high risk of progression to AD. A study group of 399 women aged 68–79 years who lived for more than 20 years at the same residential address has been assessed for long-term exposure to PM and tested for MCI. The exposure assessment comprised background concentration of PM10 and traffic-related PM indicated by the distance of the residential address to the next busy road. The women were assessed for MCI by a battery of several neuropsychological tests and their odor identification ability. Consistent effects of traffic-related air pollution exposure on test performances including a dose–response relation were found. The associations were adjusted for potential confounders using regression analysis. These results indicate that chronic exposure to traffic-related PM may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.},

   abstract = {Background
Previous research demonstrates that ambient air pollution exacerbates asthma. Asthma morbidity also varies with socioeconomic position (SEP). Few studies have examined if ambient air pollution has a differential impact on income subgroups of the population. This paper investigates socioeconomic variation in ambulatory physician consultations for asthma and assesses possible effect modification of SEP on the association between physician visits and air pollution for children aged 1–17 and adults aged 18–64 in Toronto, Canada, between 1992 and 2001.
Methods
Generalized additive models and generalized linear models were used to estimate the adjusted risk of asthma physician visits associated with an interquartile range increase in sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM2.5), and ozone (O3).
Results
A socioeconomic gradient in the number of physician visits was observed among children and adults and both sexes. SO2, NO2, and PM2.5 had positive associations with physician visits. The risk ratios for the low socioeconomic group were significantly greater than those for the high socioeconomic group in several of the models of SO2 and PM2.5.
Conclusions
These findings suggest increased ambulatory physician visits represent another component of the public health impact of urban air pollution. The burden of this impact may be borne disproportionately by those with lower SEP. Clarifying the role of SEP in altering susceptibility to the effects of air pollution is essential not only to inform revisions of ambient air quality standards, but also to design public health interventions to reduce health impacts on sensitive subgroups of the population.},

   abstract = {In the past decade there have been an increasing number of scientific studies describing possible effects of air pollution on perinatal health. These papers have mostly focused on commonly monitored air pollutants, primarily ozone (O3), particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and various indices of perinatal health, including fetal growth, pregnancy duration, and infant mortality. While most published studies have found some marker of air pollution related to some types of perinatal outcomes, variability exists in the nature of the pollutants and outcomes associated. Synthesis of the findings has been difficult for various reasons, including differences in study design and analysis. A workshop was held in September 2007 to discuss methodological differences in the published studies as a basis for understanding differences in study findings and to identify priorities for future research, including novel approaches for existing data. Four broad topic areas were considered: confounding and effect modification, spatial and temporal exposure variations, vulnerable windows of exposure, and multiple pollutants. Here we present a synopsis of the methodological issues and challenges in each area and make recommendations for future study. Two key recommendations include: (1) parallel analyses of existing data sets using a standardized methodological approach to disentangle true differences in associations from methodological differences among studies; and (2) identification of animal studies to inform important mechanistic research gaps. This work is of critical public health importance because of widespread exposure and because perinatal outcomes are important markers of future child and adult health.},

The aim of this study is to investigate the association between exposure to black smoke (BS; particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <4μg/m3) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) during the first trimester of pregnancy and risk of congenital anomalies. We used a case–control study design among deliveries to mothers resident in the UK Northern health region during 1985–1990. Case data were ascertained from the population-based Northern Congenital Abnormality Survey and control data from national data on all births. Data on BS and SO2 from ambient air monitoring stations were used to average the total pollutant exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy over the daily readings from all monitors within 10km of the mother's residence. Logistic regression models estimated the association via odds ratios. A significant but weak positive association was found between nervous system anomalies and BS (OR=1.10 per increase of 1000μg/m3 total BS; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.18), but not with other anomaly subtypes. For SO2, a significant negative association was found with congenital heart disease combined and patent ductus arteriosus: OR significantly <1 for all quartiles relative to the first quartile. The relationship between SO2 levels and other anomaly subtypes was less clear cut: there were either no significant associations or a suggestion of a U-shaped relationship (OR significantly <1 for moderate compared to lowest levels, but not with high SO2 levels). Overall, maternal exposure to BS and SO2 in the Northern region had limited impact on congenital anomaly risk. Studies with detailed exposure assessment are needed to further investigate this relationship.},

   abstract = {Background
Many studies have investigated the effects of air pollutants on disease and mortality. However, the results remain inconsistent and inconclusive. We thought that the impact of different seasons or ages of people may explain these differences.
Methods
Measurement of the five pollutants (particulate matter <10μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), SO2, NO2, O3, and CO) was monitored by automated measuring units at five different stations. Monitoring stations were provided by the Taiwan Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from 1997 to 1999. The subjects in the study were classified in two groups: those 65 years of age and older, and those of all ages (including the subjects in the ⩾65 group). Data on daily mortality caused by respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and all other causes including the two aforementioned was collected by the Taiwan Department of Health (DOH). A time-series regression model was used to analyze the relative risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases due to air pollution in the summer and winter seasons.
Results
Risk of death from all causes and mortality from cardiovascular diseases during winter was significantly positively correlated with levels of SO2, CO, and NO2 for both groups of subjects and additionally with PM10 for the elderly (⩾65 years old) group. There were significant positive correlations with respiratory diseases and levels of O3 for both groups. However, the only significant positive correlation was with O3 (RR=1.283) for the elderly group during summer. No other parameters showed significance for either group.
Conclusion
Our findings contribute to the evidence of an association between SO2, CO, NO2, and PM10 and mortality from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, especially among elderly people during the winter season.},

   abstract = {Background
Studies suggest that increases of fine particle concentrations (PM2.5) could be linked with a rise in cardiovascular disease. With approximately 25% of American adults aged 30 and older reporting having either heart disease or hypertension it is possible that exposure to air pollution could have significant public health consequences. This study examined the relationship between PM2.5 and the prevalence of self-reported hypertension and heart disease using data from a large nation-wide survey.
Study design
Adults, 30 years of age or older, who participated in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 1999 to 2005 were linked to annual PM2.5 data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (N=132,224). Annual air quality estimates were averaged from monitors within 20 miles of the respondent's residential block group. Respondents who reported being told they had hypertension by a health professional on two or more separate occasions were defined as hypertensive. Heart disease was defined as answering, “yes” to one or more of three NHIS questions on heart disease.
Results
A 10μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure was associated with a small elevated risk of hypertension (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00–1.10) risk of heart disease (1.08 95% CI 1.00–1.16). The association between PM2.5 and hypertension was found in non-Hispanic white adults (OR 1.10 95% CI 1.04–1.17) but not in non-Hispanic black or Hispanic adults.
Conclusions
Findings from this study complement those from other studies and indicate that PM2.5 adversely affects cardiovascular health. Our results are consistent with other studies in showing a small association between exposure to PM2.5 and cardiovascular outcomes.},

   abstract = {Traffic-generated air pollution and noise have both been linked to cardiovascular morbidity. Since traffic is a shared source, there is potential for correlated exposures that may lead to confounding in epidemiologic studies. As part of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Air Pollution (MESA Air), 2-week NO and NO2 concentrations were measured at up to 105 locations, selected primarily to characterize gradients near major roads, in each of 9 US communities. We measured 5-min A-weighted equivalent continuous sound pressure levels (Leq) and ultrafine particle (UFP) counts at a subset of these NO/NO2 monitoring locations in Chicago, IL (N=69 in December 2006; N=36 in April 2007) and Riverside County, CA (N=46 in April 2007). Leq and UFP were measured during non-“rush hour” periods (10:00–16:00) to maximize comparability between measurements. We evaluated roadway proximity exposure surrogates in relation to the measured levels, estimated noise–air pollution correlation coefficients, and evaluated the impact of regional-scale pollution gradients, wind direction, and roadway proximity on the correlations. Five-minute Leq measurements in December 2006 and April 2007 were highly correlated (r=0.84), and measurements made at different times of day were similar (coefficients of variation: 0.5–13%), indicating that 5-min measurements are representative of long-term Leq. Binary and continuous roadway proximity metrics characterized Leq as well or better than NO or NO2. We found strong regional-scale gradients in NO and NO2, particularly in Chicago, but only weak regional-scale gradients in Leq and UFP. Leq was most consistently correlated with NO, but the correlations were moderate (0.20–0.60). After removing the influence of regional-scale gradients the correlations generally increased (Leq–NO: r=0.49–0.62), and correlations downwind of major roads (Leq–NO: r=0.53–0.74) were consistently higher than those upwind (0.35–0.65). There was not a consistent effect of roadway proximity on the correlations. In conclusion, roadway proximity variables are not unique exposure surrogates in studies of endpoints hypothesized to be related to both air pollution and noise. Moderate correlations between traffic-generated air pollution and noise suggest the possibility of confounding, which might be minimized by considering regional pollution gradients and/or prevailing wind direction(s) in epidemiologic studies.},

   abstract = {Exposure to traffic-related air pollution in urban environment is common and has been associated with adverse human health effects. In utero exposures that result in DNA damage may affect health later in life. Early effects of maternal and in utero exposures to traffic-related air pollution were assessed through the use of validated biomarkers in blood cells from mother–newborn pairs. A cross-sectional biomonitoring study with healthy pregnant women living in the Greater Copenhagen area, Denmark, was conducted. Bulky DNA adducts and micronuclei (MN) were measured in blood from 75 women and 69 umbilical cords, concurrently collected at the time of planned Caesarean section. Modeled residential traffic density, a proxy measure of traffic-related air pollution exposures, was validated by indoor levels of nitrogen dioxide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in 42 non-smoking homes. DNA adduct levels were similar and positively correlated in maternal and cord blood (1.40 vs. 1.37n/108 nucleotides; r=0.99; p<0.01). Maternal MN frequencies were significantly associated with age (p<0.01), and higher than those of the newborns (7.0 vs. 3.2 MN per 1000 binucleated cells). Adduct levels were highest among mother–newborn pairs who lived near medium-traffic-density (>400–2500vehiclekm/24h; p<0.01) places. MN frequencies among newborns from women who lived at high-traffic-density homes (>2500vehiclekm/24h) were significantly increased (p=0.02). This trend remained after adjusting for potential confounders and effect modifiers. For the first time increased bulky DNA adducts and MN in cord blood after maternal exposures to traffic-related air pollution are found, demonstrating that these transplacental environmental exposures induce DNA damage in newborns. Given that increased DNA damage early in life indicate an increased risk for adverse health effects later in life, these findings justify intervention of pregnant women.},

We evaluated 2604 (83%) cases and 23,354 (85%) controls with information allowing adjustment for mother's education, mother's smoking during pregnancy, and infant race/ethnicity. Effect estimates derived from conditional logistic regression revealed very modest increased risk and were not statistically significant for any of the exposure metrics in fully adjusted models. Overall, risk estimates were stronger when restricted to bronchiolitis cases attributed to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) versus unspecified and for longer exposure windows. The adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) and 95% confidence interval per 10mcg/m3 increase in lifetime PM2.5 was 1.14, 0.88–1.46 for RSV bronchiolitis hospitalization. This risk was also elevated for infants who resided within 150m of a highway (ORadj 1.17, 0.95–1.44). This study supports a developing hypothesis that there may be a modest increased risk of bronchiolitis attributable to chronic traffic-derived particulate matter exposure particularly for infants born just before or during peak RSV season. Future studies are needed that can investigate threshold effects and capture larger variability in spatial contrasts among populations of infants.},

Background
The goal of asthma management is to achieve disease control, defined. as the ability to lead a normal life with normal pulmonary function. However, many epidemiological surveys have demonstrated that asthma control is unacceptable in the majority of patients.
Objective
To evaluate asthma control in 624 adults with asthma in the Maghreb, participating in the AIRMAG survey.
Methods
As part of a general population survey of asthma in the Maghreb conducted by structured telephone interview, information was obtained on asthma control and treatment. Control was determined with the Asthma Control Test (ACT) and using an algorithm based on the GINA control guidelines.
Results
The mean ACT score was 16.6 ± 4.6, corresponding to uncontrolled asthma. Asthma was uncontrolled (ACT score ⩽19) in 71.3% of subjects and optimally controlled (ACT score = 25) in 3.7%. Using the GINA-based algorithm, asthma was uncontrolled in 50.9% and controlled in 7.6%. Asthma control differed between countries, being best in Tunisia and worst in Morocco (p = 0.004). Only 163 subjects (26.1%) were receiving a recommended prophylactic treatment (inhaled corticosteroids alone or in association with long-acting β-agonists). Other factors associated with asthma control were educational level, asthma perceptions and frequency of physician consultations.
Conclusions
Asthma control is unacceptably poor in the Maghreb. This could be changed by improved access to appropriate treatments, more proactive patient follow-up and better patient education.},

Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a common genetic disease which affects both lung and liver. Early diagnosis can help asymptomatic patients to adjust their lifestyle choices in order to reduce the risk of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The determination of this genetic deficiency prevalence in Madeira Island (Portugal) population is important to clarify susceptibility and define the relevance of performing genetic tests for AAT on individuals at risk for COPD. Two hundred samples of unrelated individuals from Madeira Island were genotyped for the two most common AAT deficiency alleles, PI*S and PI*Z, using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Mediated Site-Directed Mutagenesis. Our results show one of the highest frequencies for both mutations when compared to any already studied population in the world. In fact, PI*S mutation has the highest prevalence (18%), and PI*Z mutation (2.5%) was the third highest worldwide. The frequency of AAT deficiency genotypes in Madeira (PI*ZZ, PI*SS, and PI*SZ) is estimated to be the highest in the world: 41 per 1000. This high prevalence of AAT deficiency on Madeira Island reveals an increased genetic susceptibility to COPD and suggests a routine genetic testing for individuals at risk.},

Studies relating lung function to survival commonly express lung function impairment as a percent of predicted but this retains age, height and sex bias. We have studied alternative methods of expressing forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) for predicting all cause and airway related lung disease mortality in the Copenhagen City Heart Study data. Cox regression models were derived for survival over 25 years in 13,900 subjects. Age on entry, sex, smoking status, body mass index, previous myocardial infarction and diabetes were putative predictors together with FEV1 either as raw data, standardised by powers of height (FEV1/htn), as percent of predicted (FEV1PP) or as standardised residuals (FEV1SR). Quintiles of FEV1/ht2 were better at predicting all cause mortality in multivariate models than FEV1PP and FEV1SR, with the hazard ratio (HR) for the worst quintiles being 2.8, 2.0 and 2.1 respectively. Cut levels of lung function were used to categorise impairment and the HR for multivariate prediction of all cause and airway related lung disease mortality were 10 and 2044 respectively for the worst category of FEV1/ht2 compared to 5 and 194 respectively for the worst category of FEV1PP. In univariate predictions of all cause mortality the HR for FEV1/ht2 categories was 2–4 times higher than those for FEV1PP and 3–10 times higher for airway related lung disease mortality. We conclude that FEV1/ht2 is superior to FEV1PP for predicting survival in a general population and this method of expressing FEV1 impairment best reflects hazard for subsequent death.},

   abstract = {Summary
Asthma is the most frequently encountered allergic respiratory disease, and one that has a potentially serious impact on patients' functioning and well-being. From a public health perspective, it is important to collect data on the prevalence, burden and management of asthma in order to improve understanding of the pathogenesis of asthma and to ensure that national healthcare policies are adapted and appropriate. In this respect, the different AIR surveys, which have collected standardised data on asthma in the general population of a large number of countries around the world, have made an important contribution. The latest of these surveys is the AIRMAG survey, performed in the three Maghreb countries of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. In these countries, the prevalence of asthma (3.4% to 3.9%) is in the low to moderate range. This is consistent with rates observed elsewhere in the Mediterranean basin. Nonetheless, the prevalence of asthma in the Maghreb may be expected to rise in the future as populations become more urbanised and adopt a more ‘Westernised’ lifestyle. Indeed the prevalence of asthma is already higher in the urban coastal regions of these countries than in the more rural mountainous and desert regions. Asthma control in the Maghreb is relatively poor compared to other regions evaluated in previous AIR studies, with control being unacceptable in around three-quarters of respondents. Although part of the explanation may reside in limited access to care, treatment rates for inhaled corticosteroids (26.1% of adults and 29.1% of children) were no worse than those reported in previous AIR studies. On the other hand, asthma monitoring through regular follow-up visits, home flow-meter use and preparation of individualised asthma management plans was in general unsatisfactory. In addition, awareness of asthma in the general population of the Maghreb countries was low. Education measures directed at the patient, together with programmes directed at the physician to ensure systematic monitoring and the use of a ‘treat to target’ approach to therapy, could do much to increase quality of life and minimise restrictions on activities in patients with asthma in the Maghreb.},

Common genetic variation may play an important role in altering chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk. In Xuanwei, China, the COPD rate is more than twice the Chinese national average, and COPD is strongly associated with in-home coal use. To identify genetic variation that may be associated with COPD in a population with substantial in-home coal smoke exposures, we evaluated 1261 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 380 candidate genes potentially relevant for cancer and other human diseases in a population-based case–control study in Xuanwei (53 cases; 107 controls). PTEN was the most significantly associated gene with COPD in a minP analysis using 20,000 permutations (P=0.00005). SNP-based analyses found that homozygote variant carriers of PTEN rs701848 (ORTT=0.12, 95% CI=0.03–0.47) had a significant decreased risk of COPD. PTEN, or phosphatase and tensin homolog, is an important regulator of cell cycle progression and cellular survival via the AKT signaling pathway. Our exploratory analysis suggests that genetic variation in PTEN may be an important risk factor of COPD in Xuanwei. However, due to the small sample size, additional studies are needed to evaluate these associations within Xuanwei and other populations with coal smoke exposures.},

   abstract = {This paper presents characterization factors (CFs) for human health effects of fine particulate (PM10) and ozone in Europe for the purpose of life cycle impact assessment. The CFs express the change in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) of European inhabitants due to a change in emissions of PM10, ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). The CF consists of an intake factor, an effect factor, and a damage factor. The intake factor was modeled as the change in population exposure to primary and secondary aerosols, and ozone due to a change in emission of a substance. This was done with the models EUTREND (aerosols) and LOTOS–EUROS (ozone). A combined human effect and damage factor, represented by the change in DALY due to a change in population intake was derived from epidemiological-based relative risks of short-term mortality, long-term mortality, and morbidity. Primary PM10 causes 260 DALYs per kton emission, while secondary aerosol formation results in CFs between 51 and 83 DALYs per kton of precursor emitted. Applying CFs for high and low stack sources separately for PM10 and SO2 life cycle emissions can lead to a better estimation of human health damage due to these pollutants. CF related to ozone formation emissions appear to be much lower (0.04 DALY per kton, calculated based on maximum daily 8-h average ozone concentration) compared to the CF for primary and secondary PM10. When calculating CF based on 24-h average ozone concentration, NMVOC causes 0.04 DALYs per kton, while the CF for NOx causing ozone formation is negative due to reactivity of ozone with NO in areas with high NOx levels (−0.12 DALYs per kton). Total European emissions of the five priority air pollutants in year 2000 are attributed to 4.2 million DALYs for the European population, which corresponds on average to 0.25 DALYs per person over a lifetime (80 years).},

To describe the degree of annoyance caused by air pollution and noise in pregnant women in a birth cohort; to determine the modifying factors and their relation with exposure to ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2).
Methods
The study population was 855 pregnant women in Valencia, Spain. Annoyance caused by air pollution and noise, and explanatory factors were obtained from 786 pregnant women through a questionnaire. NO2 levels were determined combining measurements at 93 points within the area of study and using geostatistical techniques (kriging).
Results
In all 7.9% of the women reported high annoyance caused by air pollution and 13.1% high annoyance caused by noise. There was a significant difference in the degree of annoyance due to both air pollution and noise depending on the area where the women lived and their working status. The degree of annoyance correlated better with measured NO2 at the municipality level (air pollution: r=0.53; noise: r=0.44) than at the individual level (air pollution and noise: r=0.21). On multivariate analysis, being a housewife, higher NO2 levels and high traffic density were associated with higher degrees of annoyance.
Conclusions
There was a high percentage of women who perceived medium–high annoyance due to noise and air pollution. Annoyance caused by environmental pollutants could lead to some psychological effects, which impair the quality of life, or even physiological ones, which affect prenatal development.},

In the USA, nationally representative health data are collected in the NHIS and annual air quality data are collected by the EPA. The linkage of these data for research is not straightforward and the choices made may introduce bias into results. The 2000–2003 NHIS and air quality data for six air pollutants were linked by residential block group and monitor location, which differ by pollutants. For each pollutant, three annual exposure variables were assigned to respondents: (1) average of all monitors in the county, (2) of monitors within a 5-mile radius of the distance between block group and monitor, and (3) within a 20-mile radius. Exposure estimates, study sample characteristics, and association between fine particle exposure and respondent-reported health status were compared for different geographic linkage methods. The results showed that study sample characteristics varied by geographic linkage method and pollutant linked. Generally, the fewer the NHIS respondents linked, the higher is the pollution exposure and lower is the percentage of non-Hispanic whites. After adjustment for sociodemographic and geographic factors, associations between fine particles and health status were generally comparable across study samples. Because exposure information is not available for all potential participants in an epidemiological study, selection effects should be considered when drawing inferences about air quality–health associations. With the current monitoring data system, the study sample is substantially reduced when linkage to multiple pollutants is performed.},

In Colombo city, a correlation has been shown between the lime production and the number of persons who need respiratory treatment in a local hospital, indicating that the lime industry can cause deleterious health effects in the exposed workers and population. This research was conducted to deal firstly with the characterization of the size distribution and chemical compositions of particles emitted from lime manufacturing and subsequently to assess the deposition rate of inhaled dolomitic lime aerosol particles in the human respiratory tract. The elemental chemical composition and particle size of individual atmospheric particles was quantitatively elucidated, including low-Z components like C, N and O, as well as higher-Z elements, using automated electron probe microanalysis. Information concerning the bulk composition is provided by energy-dispersive X-ray detection. The majority of the respirable particulate matter identified was composed of aluminosilicates, Ca–Mg oxides, carbon-rich particles, mixtures of organic particles and Ca–Mg carbonates, soot and biogenic particles. In view of the chemical composition and size distribution of the aerosol particles, local deposition efficiencies in the human respiratory system were calculated, revealing the deposition of CaO·MgO at extrathoracic, tracheobronchial and pulmonary levels. The results of this study offer evidence to the threat of the fine and coarse particles emitted from dolomite lime manufacturing, allowing policy-makers to better focus their mitigation strategies in an effective way, as well as to the dolomite producers for the purpose of designing and/or implementing improved emission controls.},

Herein, we evaluate the possible toxic effect of UAP-BA-soluble fraction (UAP-BAsf) on pulmonary cells obtained from young (1–2 months old) and aged (9–12 months old) Wistar rats using phagocytosis, oxidant–antioxidant generation, and apoptosis as endpoints. UAP-BA were collected in downtown BA and residual oil fly ash (ROFA), employed as a positive control, was collected from Boston Edison Co., Mystic Power Plant, Mystic, CT, USA. Both particle-soluble fractions (sf) were employed at concentrations ranging from 0 to 100μg/mL. UAP-BAsf and ROFAsf even at the lowest dose assayed (10μg/mL) showed in both lung cell populations the ability to stimulate phagocytosis and increase superoxide anion (O2−) generation. Both types of air particles caused a marked intracellular oxidant stress in aged pulmonary cells that may contribute to subsequent cell activation and production of proinflammatory mediators, leading to cell dysfunction. These data suggest that the impact of UAP-BAsf on phagocytosis, oxidant radical generation, and apoptosis is clearly dependent on the maturational state of the animal and might have different mechanisms of action.},

   abstract = {Context and objective
Asthma among children is a major public health problem worldwide. There are increasing number of studies suggesting a possible association between allergenic pollen and exacerbations of asthma. In the context of global climate change, a number of future climate and air pollution scenarios predict increases in concentrations of pollen, an extension of the pollen season, and an increase in the allergenicity of pollen. The goal of the present study is to evaluate the short-term effects of exposure to grass and weed pollen on emergency department visits and readmissions for asthma among children aged 0–9 years living in Montreal between April and October, 1994–2004.
Methodology and results
Time-series analyses were carried out using parametric log-linear overdispersed Poisson models that were adjusted for temporal variations, daily weather conditions (temperature, atmospheric pressure), and gaseous air pollutants (ozone and nitrogen dioxide). We have found positive associations between emergency department visits and concentrations of grass pollen 3 days after exposure. The effect of grass pollen was higher on emergency department readmissions as compared to initial visits. Weak negative associations were found between weed pollen (including ragweed pollen) and emergency department visits 2 days after exposure.
Conclusion

   abstract = {The impact of particle emissions by biomass burning is increasing throughout the world. We explored the toxicity of particulate matter produced by sugar cane burning and compared these effects with equivalent mass of traffic-derived particles. For this purpose, BALB/c mice received a single intranasal instillation of either distilled water (C) or total suspended particles (15μg) from an urban area (SP group) or biomass burning-derived particles (Bio group). Lung mechanical parameters (total, resistive and viscoelastic pressures, static elastance, and elastic component of viscoelasticity) and histology were analyzed 24h after instillation. Trace elements and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) metabolites of the two sources of particles were determined. All mechanical parameters increased similarly in both pollution groups compared with control, except airway resistive pressure, which increased only in Bio. Both exposed groups showed significantly higher fraction area of alveolar collapse, and influx of polymorphonuclear cells in lung parenchyma than C. The composition analysis of total suspended particles showed higher concentrations of PAHs and lower concentration of metals in traffic than in biomass burning-derived particles. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a single low dose of ambient particles, produced by traffic and sugar cane burning, induced significant alterations in pulmonary mechanics and lung histology in mice. Parenchymal changes were similar after exposure to both particle sources, whereas airway mechanics was more affected by biomass-derived particles. Our results indicate that biomass particles were at least as toxic as those produced by traffic.},

   abstract = {Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common respiratory pathogens in infants and young children. It is not known why some previously healthy infants, when in contact with RSV, develop bronchiolitis whereas others have only mild symptoms. Our study aimed to evaluate the possible association between emergency hospital visits for bronchiolitis and air pollution in the Paris region during four winter seasons. We included children under the age of 3 years who attended emergency room services for bronchiolitis (following standardized definition) during the period 1997–2001. Two series of data from 34 hospitals, the daily number of emergency hospital consultations (n=50857) and the daily number of hospitalizations (n=16588) for bronchiolitis, were analyzed using alternative statistical methods; these were the generalized additive model (GAM) and case-crossover models. After adjustments for public holidays, holidays and meteorological variables the case-crossover model showed that PM10, BS, SO2 and NO2 were positively associated with both consultations and hospitalizations. GAM models, adjusting for long-term trend, seasonality, holiday, public holiday, weekday and meteorological variables, gave similar results for SO2 and PM10. This study shows that air pollution may act as a trigger for the occurrence of acute severe bronchiolitis cases.},

   abstract = {Background and objective
Respiratory diseases constitute one of the leading causes of ill health among children in New York State (NYS). The current project, a component of the NYS Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, investigated a potential association between ambient ozone (O3) concentration and childhood respiratory hospital admissions over 11 years in NYS.
Methods
We used a two-stage Bayesian hierarchical model to assess the exposure–disease associations within 11 geographic regions and statewide. The data included total daily hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases for children 0–17 years old from 1991 to 2001 in NYS (N=134,099) and daily ambient O3 level with different single-day lags. These analyses adjusted for particulate matter ⩽10μm in size (PM10), meteorological conditions, day of the week, seasonality, long-term trends, and demographic characteristics.
Results
In 5 of the 11 regions, including the Upper and Lower Adirondacks, Upper Hudson Valley, Staten Island, and New York City, positive associations were found between respiratory hospital admissions and ambient O3 level 2 days prior to the admission. Applying different statistical methods and sensitivity analysis of PM10 did not alter these findings. When region-specific results were combined, no statewide association was apparent.
Conclusions
Geographic differences were found in the associations between O3 levels and respiratory hospital admissions among children. In addition, we found that the two-stage model may be an appropriate approach for tracking the health effects of air pollution over time in different geographic areas when heterogeneity of risk factors across regions is present.},

Asian dust storms reaching Taipei, Taiwan are tracked by satellite images and confirmed by backward trajectory analysis and ground air pollution monitoring between 1995 and 2002. Our outcome variables include emergency visits for ischaemic heart diseases (ICD-9-CM 410-411, 414), cerebrovascular diseases (ICD-9-CM 430-437), and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (ICD-9-CM 493, 496) from the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). We use simple paired t-test and Poisson regression models to compare difference in emergency visits, air pollution levels and meteorological conditions for the pairs of Asian dust events and pre-dust periods. There were 39 high dust events with PM10 greater than 90μg/m3 and another 46 low dust events with PM10 less than 90μg/m3. Compared to their pre-dust periods, PM10 concentrations are significantly increased by 77μg/m3 per event for the high dust events. Asian dust storms increase cardiopulmonary emergency visits during storm-affecting periods in Taipei when ambient PM10 concentrations are above 90μg/m3. Compared to their pre-dust periods, emergency visits for ischaemic heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and COPD during high dust events are increased by 0.7 case (35%), 0.7 case (20%), and 0.9 case (20%) per event, respectively, by paired t-tests. By comparing the model-predicted to the observed emergency visits, we find emergency visits for cardiovascular diseases (ICD-9-CM 410-411, 414, 430-437) were significantly increased by 2.9 cases (67%) per event for the 39 high Asian dust events.},

Objective
The possible effect of the various meteorological variables on the incidence of upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs) has intrigued the scientific community for decades.
Methods
We performed a retrospective analysis regarding the association between meteorological variables and clinical data for upper and lower RTIs in the area of Attica, Greece.
Results
There was a statistically significant (P<0.001) negative correlation between weekly average temperature with the proportion of weekly house call visits resulting in a diagnosis of upper or lower RTIs 4 days later (R=−0.56 and −0.71 for upper and lower RTIs, respectively) as well as 7 days later (R=−0.57 and −0.71 for upper and lower RTIs, respectively) and during the same day (R=−0.55 and −0.68 for upper and lower RTIs, respectively). In addition, there was a negative correlation between weekly wind chill average (and minimum) temperature as well as a positive correlation of relative humidity with upper and lower RTIs. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between wind speed and upper or lower RTIs.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that house call visits due to upper and lower RTIs increased as the average temperature in the area of Attica decreased.},

Objectives
There is evidence suggesting that secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is causally linked to adverse respiratory effects. We examined the relations between the exposure to SHS and radiological signs in chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).
Methods
Asbestos-exposed workers (n=633) were imaged with HRCT, primarily to investigate potential occupational lung disease. After excluding current smokers, the study population included 361 ex- and 141 never-smokers. They answered a questionnaire on occupational exposures, smoking habits and SHS exposure. HRCT images were assessed for emphysema, ground-glass, irregular/linear and rounded opacities, honeycombing and several other signs. Regression analyses were adjusted for asbestos exposure, ex-smoking, age, body mass index and potential reader effect.
Results
Due to missing data the multivariate analyses were restricted to 310 participants aged 47.5–87.0 years. Their lifetime SHS exposure ranged between 0 and 193.5 pack-years (mean 23.5), and exposure in the past 12 months 0–30 packs (0.43). Total (B=0.005, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 0.002–0.008, p=0.000) and workplace (B=0.006, 95% CI 0.003–0.009, p=0.001) cumulative SHS exposures were significantly related to ground-glass opacities. Total SHS exposure in the last 12 months (B=0.027, 95% CI 0.000–0.054, p=0.048) and workplace exposure (B=0.027, 95% CI 0.000–0.054, p=0.048) were also significantly related to ground-glass opacities. Positive effects of SHS were also detected on irregular/linear opacities.
Conclusions
SHS exposure in the last 12 months and over lifetime significantly increases ground-glass opacity in HRCT, suggesting an early or subclinical desquamative interstitial pneumonia/respiratory bronchiolitis. This study further supports that SHS has adverse effects on the lungs that can be detected by X-ray methods.},

   abstract = {During a measurement campaign at a semi-urban/industrial site a grass-cutting event was observed, when the lawn in the immediate surrounding of the measurement site was mowed. Using a wide variety of state-of-the-art aerosol measurement technology allowed a broad characterization of the aerosol generated by the lawn mowing. The instrumentation included two on-line aerosol mass spectrometers: an Aerodyne Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (ToF-AMS) and a TSI Aerosol Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (ATOFMS); in addition, a selection of on-line aerosol concentration and size distribution instruments (OPC, APS, SMPS, CPC, FDMS-TEOM, MAAP) was deployed. From comparison of background aerosol measurements during most of the day with the aerosol measured during the lawn mowing, the grass cutting was found to generate mainly two different types of aerosol particles: an intense ultrafine particle mode (1h average: 4μgm−3) of almost pure hydrocarbon-like organics and a distinct particle mode in the upper sub-micrometer size range containing particles with potassium and nitrogen-organic compounds. The ultrafine particles are probably lubricating oil particles from the lawn mower exhaust; the larger particles are swirled-up plant debris particles from the mowing process. While these particle types were identified in the data from the two mass spectrometers, the on-line aerosol concentration and size distribution data support these findings. The results presented here show that the combination of quantitative aerosol particle ensemble mass spectrometry (ToF-AMS) and single particle mass spectrometry (ATOFMS) provides much deeper insights into the nature of the aerosol properties than each of the instruments could do alone. Therefore a combined deployment of both types of instruments is strongly recommended.},

   abstract = {In August 2006, pedestrian exposure to PM2.5 was monitored along a busy roadway in Sydney, Australia. The objective of the campaign was to assess the factors affecting exposure at both an inter- and intra-trip level. PM2.5 measurements were made at second-by-second intervals using a portable aerosol monitor, while simultaneously recording location with a personal GPS device. A digital voice recorder was used to record any events or circumstances, perceived to notably increase potential PM2.5 levels. The average PM2.5 concentration for the 39 trips conducted was 12.8μgm−3, which while 40% higher than concurrent ambient measurements was well within proposed daily standards for Australia. Multivariate time-series methods were then applied to study the effects of various interventions on PM2.5 at an intra-trip level while controlling for autocorrelation. Wind speed, traffic volumes and clearway operations (independent of traffic volumes) were found to be significant predictors in addition to the previous PM2.5 concentrations. Sensitivity analysis showed doubling traffic volumes increased PM2.5 concentrations by 26%, while each 5kmh−1 increase in wind speed increased PM2.5 concentrations by 10%. Several PM2.5 hotspots were identified where concentrations exceeded 100μgm−3. These were attributed to specific traffic (intersections, trucks, buses) and non-traffic sources (pedestrians smoking), typically only lasting a few seconds.},

   abstract = {This article explains the new emission inventory for navigation in Denmark, covering national sea transport, fisheries and international sea transport. For national sea transport, the new Danish inventory distinguishes between regional ferries, local ferries and other national sea transport. Detailed traffic and technical data lie behind the fleet activity-based fuel consumption and emission calculations for regional ferries. For local ferries and other national sea transport, the new inventory is partly fleet activity based; fuel consumption estimates are calculated for single years, and full fuel consumption coverage is established in a time series by means of appropriate assumptions. For fisheries and international sea transport, the new inventory remains fuel based, using fuel sales data from the Danish Energy Authority (DEA). The new Danish inventory uses specific fuel consumption (sfc) and NOx emission factors as a function of engine type and production year. These factors, which are used directly for regional ferries and, for the remaining navigation categories, are derived by means of appropriate assumptions, serve as a major inventory improvement, necessary for making proper emission trend assessments. International sea transport is the most important fuel consumption and emission source for navigation, and the contributions are large even compared with the overall Danish totals. If the contributions from international sea transport were included in the Danish all-sector totals, the extra contributions in 2005 from fuel consumption (and CO2), NOx and SO2 would be 5%, 34% and 167%, respectively. The 1990–2005 changes in fuel consumption as well as NOx and SO2 emissions for national sea transport (−45, −45, −81), fisheries (−18, 6, −18) and international sea transport (−14, 1, −14) reflect changes in fleet activity/fuel consumption and emission factors. The 2006–2020 emission forecasts demonstrate a need for stricter fuel quality and NOx emission standards for navigation, in order to gain emission improvements in line with those achieved for other mobile sources. The new fuel consumption estimates for national sea transport are regarded as much more accurate than the DEA fuel sales data used previously, and the recommendation for DEA is to replace their current fuel sales figures by the new estimates calculated in this project. Such updated fuel consumption time series for national sea transport will lead, in turn, to changes in the energy statistics for fisheries (gas oil) and industry (heavy fuel oil), so the national energy balance can remain unchanged. For international transport, fuel sales data as such are regarded as highly accurate for Denmark, since they are compiled from audited information from the Danish oil suppliers, and the inventory approach follows good practice for the United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Changes (UNFCCC) and United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) convention, when fleet activity data are missing. However, in order to make inventory upgrades and to support Danish policymakers in bunker emissions allocation, fleet activity-based estimates calculated in a further project would be useful.},

Source apportionment of PM was performed using a receptor model, positive matrix factorization (PMF), to identify possible sources of PM and determine the influence of each identified source on local air quality. High concentrations of PM2.5 (<2.5μm) were observed in winter months with an average of 18μgm−3, while the average concentration in summer months was approximately 6μgm−3. PMF apportioned the PM2.5 mass into seven factors identified as Na-rich, secondary sulfate, wood burning, wood processing, crustal material, traffic, and winter heating. The most important sources affecting ambient air quality in the deep valley rural area were wood burning and winter heating factors. In winter the wood burning and winter heating sources accounted for approximately 31% and 43% of the total PM2.5 mass, respectively, indicating the significant influence of biomass burning in the rural area. The wood burning and winter heating factors were highly associated with high organic carbon and volatile organic compounds. The identity of the sources was further elucidated by exploring their relationship with other measured parameters; a correlation study was conducted to evaluate relationships between the sources, gaseous pollutants, and meteorological variables.},

Continuous simultaneous measurements were made at the lagoon using a dynamic flow-through chamber system for ∼1 week during four seasons, October–November 2004 (fall), February 2005 (winter), April 2005 (spring), and June 2005 (summer) in an effort to examine diurnal and seasonal variability, and the respective relationships of NH3-N and H2S emissions to lagoon physicochemical properties. Continuously measured lagoon physicochemical parameters include lagoon surface temperature and lagoon pH. Aqueous lagoon samples were collected daily and analyzed for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN), and total sulfide concentration. TKN, TAN, and sulfide concentrations ranged from 400–650, 360–590, and 0.1–13.0mgL−1, respectively. For NH3-N, the largest fluxes were observed during the summer (>4200μg Nm−2min−1). During the fall and spring, average NH3-N fluxes were 1634±505 and >2495μg Nm−2min−1, respectively. The lowest fluxes were observed during the winter where average flux values were 1290±246μg Nm−2min−1. Fluxes for H2S were negligible during the winter season. Average fluxes increased during the fall (0.3±0.1μgm−2min−1) and spring (0.5±1.0μgm−2min−1), and highest flux values were observed during the summer (5.3±3.2μgm−2min−1). The seasonal NH3-N and H2S emission factors ranged from ∼10 to ∼40kg NAU−1yr−1 (1AU=500kg live animal weight) and ∼0 to ∼0.05kg H2SAU−1yr−1, respectively. Generally, the lagoon emissions for H2S were ∼3–4 orders of magnitude less than NH3-N.

Experimental results suggest that the TSI DustTrak overestimated PM10 and PM2.5 levels by about 2.0 and 2.2 times, respectively, compared with those measured by the Met One E-BAM sampler. Measurement results show that average PM10 levels inside trains and on station platforms were 10–97μgm−3 and 11–137μgm−3, respectively, and average PM2.5 levels were 8–68μgm−3 and 7–100μgm−3, respectively.

Additionally, the PM10 and PM2.5 levels measured by ambient air-quality monitoring stations near selected metro stations correspond to PM levels in the urban atmospheric environment in Taipei. Statistical results demonstrate that average PM10 and PM2.5 levels in metro stations were about 0.65–1.53 times and 0.89–1.75 times, respectively, those for urban ambient air. The PM levels inside stations and outdoors are positively correlated, indicating that PM levels in the metro system are influenced significantly by outdoor ambient PM levels.},

   abstract = {Two-year measurements of particle number size distribution (3nm–10μm) were conducted in Beijing, China since March 2004. Their seasonal, weekly and diurnal variations and dependencies on meteorological parameters were investigated. The annual average particle number concentrations of the nucleation mode (3–20nm), Aitken mode (20–100nm), and accumulation mode (0.1–1μm) are 9000cm−3, 15,900cm−3, and 7800cm−3, respectively. Particle number concentrations in Beijing are generally higher than that in cities of developed countries, especially for the accumulation mode particles. Both the highest total particle number concentration and the lowest volume concentration occurred in spring due to the frequent nucleation events. However, the minimum particle number concentration was observed in summer, and the maximum volume concentration in fall. The diurnal variation of the nucleation mode particles was mainly influenced by nucleation events, primarily in spring and winter. The diurnal variation of number concentration of the Aitken mode particles closely correlates with the traffic densities in all the four seasons. At the same time, obvious contribution of the growth of the nucleation mode to the number concentration of the Aitken mode particle has been also found in spring, summer, and fall. Significant differences in diurnal patterns of particle number concentrations between workdays and weekends are not observed in Beijing. Local wind speed plays an important role in shaping the particle number size distributions in the urban area of Beijing. With increasing wind speed, the nucleation and coarse mode particle number concentrations increase, while the number concentrations of the Aitken mode and accumulation mode particles decrease. A “U-shape relationship” between the total particle volume concentration and wind speed is observed. Frequently low wind speed (lower than 3m s−1) in Beijing is one of key factors leading to the poor air quality and low visibility.},

   abstract = {Weekday and weekend ambient aerosol samples were collected from the city centre of Cairo, namely “Ramsis” during the summer season of the year 2006, and have been analyzed for water-soluble ionic species. The average concentrations of the total suspended particulate matter (TSP) and their water-soluble components were higher during weekdays than on weekends, indicating that the decreased traffic density on weekends leads to a decrease in the levels of the TSP and their water-soluble ionic species. The average concentrations of the TSP were 454μgm−3 on weekdays and 298μgm−3 on weekends. The weekday/weekend concentration ratios were 1.52 for TSP, 1.27 for SO42−, 1.64 for Cl−, 1.54 for NO3−, 1.17 for NH4+, 1.67 for Ca2+, 1.83 for Na+, 1.75 for K+ and 1.73 for Mg2+. City centre of Cairo has high levels of the TSP and their water-soluble ionic species compared with many polluted cities in the world. Among all of the measured water-soluble components, SO42− was the most abundant species followed by Ca2+ on weekdays and weekends. The average mass ratios of NO3−/SO42− in the TSP were 0.41 on weekdays and 0.34 on weekends, suggesting that the stationary source emissions were more predominant. The NH4+/SO42− molar ratios and its relation with the concentrations of TSP and Ca2+ during the weekdays and weekends indicate that the chemical form of sulfate and ammonium in aerosol particles varies with TSP and Ca2+ levels. At high TSP and Ca2+ levels, and NH4+/SO42− molar ratios less than one, SO42− in aerosol particles may be present as CaSO4 and (NH4)2SO4·CaSO4·2H2O, whereas it is expected to be present as (NH4)2SO4, (NH4)2SO4·CaSO4·2H2O and CaSO4 at low levels of TSP and Ca2+, and NH4+/SO42− molar ratios between 1 and 2. The mean pH values of the TSP were 7.65 on weekdays and 6.97 on weekends, indicating that aerosol particles brought a large amount of crustal species, and might alleviate the tendency of acidification. The relationships between the concentrations of acidic components (NO3− and SO42−) and basic components (NH4+, Ca2+ and Mg2+) on weekdays and weekends indicate that the acidity of aerosol particles is neutralized. Ca2+ and NH4+ are the most dominant neutralization substances in Cairo atmosphere.},

   abstract = {The increase of allergenic symptoms has been associated with air contaminants such as ozone, particulate matter, pollen and fungal spores. Considering the potential relevance of crossed effects of non-biological pollutants and airborne pollens and fungal spores on allergy worsening, the aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of non-biological pollutants and meteorological parameters on the concentrations of pollen and fungal spores using linear correlations and multiple linear regressions. For that, the seasonal variation of ozone, particulate matter with an equivalent aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10μm, pollen and fungal spores were assessed and statistical correlations were analysed between those parameters. The data were collected through 2003–2005 in Porto, Portugal. The linear correlations showed that ozone and particulate matter had no significant influence on the concentration of pollen and fungal spores. On the contrary, when using multiple linear regressions those parameters showed to have some influence on the biological pollutants, although results were different depending on the year analysed. Among the meteorological parameters analysed, temperature was the one that most influenced the pollen and fungal spores airborne concentrations, both when using linear and multiple linear correlations. Relative humidity also showed to have some influence on the fungal spore dispersion when multiple linear regressions were used. Nevertheless, the conclusions for each pollen and fungal spore were different depending on the analysed period, which means that the correlations identified as statistically significant may not be, even so, consistent enough. Furthermore, the comparison of the results here presented with those obtained by other authors for only one period should be made carefully.},

   abstract = {Temporal and spatial variations in airborne spore concentrations of selected allergenic and pathogenic fungi were examined in Dublin, Ireland, in 2005. Air samples were taken at four outdoor locations in the city every 2 weeks, coupled with measurements of meteorological conditions. Total culturable airborne fungal spore concentrations in Dublin ranged from 30–6800 colony forming units per cubic metre of air (CFUm−3) over the 12-month period. Cladosporium, Penicillium, Aspergillus and Alternaria spores were constantly present in the Dublin atmosphere, representing >20% of the total culturable spore count. Concentrations of Cladosporium increased significantly in summer and reached allergenic threshold levels, peaking at over 3200CFUm−3 in August. Penicillium spore concentrations never reached allergenic threshold levels, with average concentrations of <150CFUm−3. Alternaria conidia formed only 0.3% of the total culturable fungal spore count and concentrations never exceeded 50CFUm−3, attributable to the coastal position of Dublin and its low levels of arable production. The opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus was present throughout the year in nominal concentrations (<10CFUm−3), but sporadic high counts were also recorded (300–400CFUm−3), the potential health implications of which give cause for concern. Spores of neither Cryptococcus neoformans nor Stachybotrys chartarum were detected, but airborne basidiospores of Schizophyllum commune were evidenced by the dikaryotization of monokaryon tester strains following exposure to the air. The relationships between airborne fungal spore concentrations and meteorological factors were analysed by redundancy analysis and revealed positive correlations between temperature and Cladosporium and relative humidity and Penicillium and Aspergillus.},

The collected data adjusted to hourly averages were used for modeling diurnal concentration behavior and development over a couple of days using Master Mechanism model developed by S. Madronich (NCAR, Boulder, CO). The H2O2 mixing ratios were found to vary between <0.05 and 6.2ppb and also exhibited a strong diurnal pattern very similar to that of ozone, with concentration maxima in the afternoon, between 15:00 and 16:00h, CET. Linear regression analysis showed that, during daytime, H2O2 positively correlated with ozone (r=0.4) and solar radiation (r=0.52), but showed only very weak negative correlations with NO2, CO and BTEX. Our H2O2 data are the first such reported data for the region and their modeling, along with ozone data, gives a valuable insight into the interplay of pollutants that affect their concentrations.},

A total of 16 major PAHs (particle-bound and gas-phase) concentrations were extracted by the Soxhlet analytical method and analyzed by gas chromatography. The dominant PAHs of the total mass of the organic compound at both the sampling sites were low-molecular-weight species. Further, the results showed that the start burning/end burning-dominant PAH concentration ratios at the OS and DS were 10 and 6.2, respectively. Diagnostic ratios were also used in this study to characterize and identify the PAH emission sources. The results suggest that the characterization of air pollutants emitted from open-burning joss paper lies between furnace-burning joss paper and wood combustion.},

   abstract = {Road-transport emissions were projected to 2020 using the TREMOVE model to estimate the vehicle stock mix over EU15 and three new European member states (Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland). The COPERT model was used to estimate the exhaust emissions of NOx, NO2 and PM2.5. Non-exhaust (tyre and break wear) PM2.5 and PM10 were also calculated. Emissions were projected following current legislation (CLE) measures and a scenario representing maximum feasible technical reductions (MFR). Projections to 2020 showed that CLE will bring 89, 25 and 50% reductions in NOx from gasoline passenger cars (GPCs), diesel passenger cars (DPCs) and heavy duty vehicles (HDVs), respectively, over 2000 levels, when comparing average emissions on a per vehicle-km basis. The corresponding reductions in the MFR scenario were 91, 53 and 67%, respectively. Despite these significant reductions, NO2 emissions do not seem to be effectively controlled for DPCs due to the increased NO2/NOx ratio of new and expected aftertreatment systems. Moreover, there is an almost 9-fold increase of NO2 emissions from mopeds, as they gradually shift to stoichiometric mixtures, four-stroke combustion and use of catalysts in the exhaust. Following CLE, PM exhaust and non-exhaust emissions will decrease on a per vehicle-km basis by 61% for DPCs and 63% for HDVs. Reductions by MFR over the reference year are estimated in the order of 77% and 65% for DPCs and HDVs, respectively. However, the increasing share of non-exhaust sources to the total PM emissions may hamper the effectiveness of exhaust control measures in meeting future urban air-quality standards.},

The highest monthly average concentration was observed in February, the end of winter in urban areas where as in rural found in spring, and the lowest concentration was observed in July (monsoon period). The continuous increase in PM10 concentration from December to February in urban areas showed accumulation of PM10 in the ambient air during the wintertime. Rainfall in June and September, during the monsoon period, caused a PM10 concentration decrease, demonstrating that precipitation is effective in removing PM10 from the valley. Cross correlation analyses among the PM10 levels measured simultaneously at the sampling stations showed a poor relationship in winter; however, there were good relationships in the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Both the PM10 concentration and the air-mixing environment in the valley were closely associated with the temperature and wind speed.},

The objective of this study was to assess whether, and to what extent, a lowering of the maximum speed limit from 100 to 80kph had reduced traffic related air pollution in the direct vicinity of a highway. A monitoring station of the Amsterdam Air Quality Monitoring Network is situated adjacent to the intervened road section. Daily mean concentrations (PM10, PM1, Black Smoke and NOx) in the first year since the intervention were compared with measured concentrations in the prior year. The intervention effect was adjusted for daily traffic flow, congestion and downwind exposure. The concentration changes were compared with those observed at a section of the same ring highway where the speed limit had not been reduced. Since the intervention, the adjusted traffic contribution to PM10 concentrations has decreased by 2.20μgm−3 (95%-CI: 1.43–2.98), PM1 0.42μgm−3 (95%-CI: 0.01–0.82) and Black Smoke 3.57μgm−3 (95%-CI: 1.50–5.65). At the not intervened highway section the adjusted traffic contribution to PM10 and Black Smoke concentrations has also decreased by 0.97 and 2.43μgm−3 respectively. However, decreases were significantly greater for PM10 and PM1 at the intervention site. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a significant reduction of PM10 and PM1 as a result of reducing the speed limit at an urban ring highway.},

Annual mean levels of N13–800 were close to 17,000 cm−3, and strongly dependent on road traffic emissions. Annual mean PM10, PM2.5 and PM1 levels were 39, 25 and 18 μg/m3, being highly influenced not only by road traffic but also by industrial emissions as well as natural events such as African dust outbreaks. Variability of number concentrations and size distribution of sub-micrometric aerosols was strongly dependent on meteorology. Primary emissions exert a high influence on the variability of levels of ultrafine (<100 nm) particles under intense Atlantic advections (lowest PM levels), while coagulation and condensation processes are enhanced under urban pollution scenarios (highest levels of PM), and photochemical nucleation processes can be an important source of ultrafine particles at midday in summer (low PM levels). African dust episodes did not modify the total number but affected the N > 400 nm. This study allows us to compare aerosol number and mass concentrations in air quality monitoring of an urban environment. Ultrafine particles measurements are indicated to detect the variability of primary traffic emissions, as well as some atmospheric processes. Measurements of PM levels are necessary to monitor other important PM sources in the studied area such as dust resuspension from road traffic or African dust.},

   abstract = {An emerging environmental issue in Canada is how to quantify the contribution of agricultural soil emissions of ammonia (NH3) to environmental pollution. Emission inventories are essential to predict these emissions and their subsequent atmospheric transportation, transformation, and deposition. Due to the high spatial and temporal variability associated with NH3 emissions, emission inventories based on measurements become expensive and emission factors lose accuracy. Process-based models are capable of accounting for the complex soil interactions, but current models lack temporal refinement and few models consider NH3 emissions. This paper presents the development of a one-dimensional (vertical), time-dependent model capable of predicting NH3 emissions from a slurry applied to a bare soil. The model is based on chemical, physical and biological relationships that govern soil heat, moisture, and nitrogen movement. Processes considered include convection, diffusion, decomposition, nitrification, denitrification, and surface to atmosphere transport. The model is tested with experimental data from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada which conducted NH3 measurements following application of dairy cattle slurry to a bare field. An investigation into the sensitivity of emissions to pH and slurry infiltration rate is conducted and model predictions are best fit to measurements based on this investigation. Testing demonstrated the model's ability to predict the large NH3 emissions immediately following application and subsequent emission trends associated with diurnal patterns that emission factors cannot capture. Results showed that model performance could benefit from a more in depth measurement program and empirical or process models of surface pH. Potential exists for the model to become a useful tool in predicting emissions on local, regional, or national scales.},

   abstract = {The number of ultrafine particles in urban air may be more health relevant than the usually measured mass of particles smaller than 2.5 or 10μm. Epidemiological studies typically assess exposure by measurements at a central site. Limited information is available about how well measurements at a central site reflect exposure to ultrafine particles. The goals of this paper are to assess the relationships between particle number (PN) and mass concentrations measured outdoors at a central site, right outside and inside the study homes. The study was conducted in four European cities: Amsterdam, Athens, Birmingham and Helsinki. Particle mass (PM10 and PM2.5), PN, soot and sulfate concentrations were measured at these sites. Measurements of indoors and outdoors near the home were made during 1 week in 152, mostly non-smoking, homes. In each city continuous measurements were also performed at a central site during the entire study period. The correlation between 24-h average central site outdoor and indoor concentrations was lower for PN (correlation among cities ranged from 0.18 to 0.45) than for PM2.5 (0.40–0.80), soot (0.64–0.92) and sulfate (0.91–0.99). In Athens, the indoor–central site correlation was similar for PN and PM2.5. Infiltration factors for PN and PM2.5 were lower than for sulfate and soot. Night-time hourly average PN concentrations showed higher correlations between indoor and central site, implying that indoor sources explained part of the low correlation found for 24-h average concentrations.

In 2005, data were obtained for 48 non-smoking adults from Windsor, Ontario in order to assess their exposure to VOCs based on their daily routines and characteristics of their homes. During the 8-week winter and summer sampling sessions, five repeated 24-h measurements were obtained for each home. This paper focuses on the analysis of 18 VOCs: 11 have been declared toxic as defined under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, [1999. Statutes of Canada. Act assented to September 14, 1999. Ottawa: Queen's Printer. Available at Canada Gazette (Part III) 22(3): (Chapter 33). http://canadagazette.gc.ca/partIII/1999/g3-02203.pdf], and seven are commonly found in household and personal care products. Results of mixed effects models indicate that personal exposure to these VOCs can be largely predicted by indoor concentrations, with models including indoor concentrations found to have an r2 value for the fixed effects ranging from 58.4% to 87.2% for the CEPA toxic VOCs and from 41.7% to 90.1% for the commonly found VOCs. Given that people spend the majority of their time inside their home, characteristics of the home such as air exchange rates, type of garage, and type of stove have a greater potential to impact personal exposures.},

Morphological and chemical composition of the dust particles were analyzed using a high resolution transmission electron microscope equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (HRTEM/EDX). Results indicated that the dusts contained high concentrations of Cd (mean 2.62), Cu (63.7), Zn (535.9) and Pb (150.9mgkg−1). Magnetic susceptibility of the dusts was in a range of (16–856)×10−8m3kg−1. It was shown that the dusts close to industrial area and busy road intersection had higher heavy metal contents and magnetic susceptibility. The dusts showed a strong positive inter-correlation for the concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cr, Zn, Pb, and Cu in addition to magnetic susceptibility, which suggests that the dusts had a common source for the heavy metals and magnetic carriers. We found that the dust particles were composed mainly of Fe-rich near-spherical, plate and agglomerate particles, and Ca-rich, S-rich and silicate particles, and that iron oxide spherules (0.2–0.5μm in diameter) and larger iron-bearing particles were the magnetic carriers. Ca in the dusts was present in the forms of CaCO3 and CaCO3/CaSO4 internal mixture. The Fe-rich, Ca-rich and S-rich particles in dusts could be directly related to nearby polluting activities, such as coal combustion, traffic emission and industrial activity. The identification of the main sources of dusts on tree leaves can help in controlling the polluting sources in urban areas. The close correlation between magnetic susceptibility and heavy metal concentration makes it possible to use the magnetic technique as a non-destructive and time-efficient tool for biomonitoring of the atmospheric dust pollutants.},

   abstract = {This paper presents characterization factors (CFs) for human health effects of fine particulate (PM10) and ozone in Europe for the purpose of life cycle impact assessment. The CFs express the change in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) of European inhabitants due to a change in emissions of PM10, ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs). The CF consists of an intake factor, an effect factor, and a damage factor. The intake factor was modeled as the change in population exposure to primary and secondary aerosols, and ozone due to a change in emission of a substance. This was done with the models EUTREND (aerosols) and LOTOS–EUROS (ozone). A combined human effect and damage factor, represented by the change in DALY due to a change in population intake was derived from epidemiological-based relative risks of short-term mortality, long-term mortality, and morbidity. Primary PM10 causes 260 DALYs per kton emission, while secondary aerosol formation results in CFs between 51 and 83 DALYs per kton of precursor emitted. Applying CFs for high and low stack sources separately for PM10 and SO2 life cycle emissions can lead to a better estimation of human health damage due to these pollutants. CF related to ozone formation emissions appear to be much lower (0.04 DALY per kton, calculated based on maximum daily 8-h average ozone concentration) compared to the CF for primary and secondary PM10. When calculating CF based on 24-h average ozone concentration, NMVOC causes 0.04 DALYs per kton, while the CF for NOx causing ozone formation is negative due to reactivity of ozone with NO in areas with high NOx levels (−0.12 DALYs per kton). Total European emissions of the five priority air pollutants in year 2000 are attributed to 4.2 million DALYs for the European population, which corresponds on average to 0.25 DALYs per person over a lifetime (80 years).},

This study seeks to examine the contribution of diesel truck traffic across Ambassador Bridge to indoor exposure patterns of elemental carbon (EC), a common surrogate for diesel exhaust particles, in homes in close proximity to the bridge. We also aim to understand the relative importance of home ventilation characteristics and wind speed. Measurements were collected as part of the Detroit Exposure and Aerosol Research Study (DEARS). Residential indoor and outdoor EC measurements were collected over five consecutive 24 h periods in both the summer and winter at 16 homes in close proximity to Ambassador Bridge. Ambient concentrations and meteorological data were collected at a central-site monitor, and home air exchange rates were estimated using a perfluorocarbon tracer. The contributions of ambient concentrations and Ambassador Bridge, and potential effect modification by wind speed and home ventilation status were quantified with regression analyses. Both ambient concentrations and the percentage of time a home was downwind from the bridge were associated with an increase in indoor concentrations. Ambient concentrations significantly contributed to indoor concentrations regardless of wind speed category but were a greater influence in home experiencing calm winds. The effect of the percent of time downwind variable on indoor levels was only significant in homes where the ventilation status was high. The distance a home was from the bridge tollbooth complex was not significantly associated with indoor concentrations. We conclude that diesel traffic emissions related to Ambassador Bridge may have an impact on indoor EC exposures. Given that people spend the majority of their time indoors, it is important to evaluate the impact of traffic-related pollution in the home environment.},

Two case studies are made with study domains located in a hilly region in the northwest of the Styrian capital Graz, the second largest town in Austria. Mountainous terrain as well as inhomogeneous and time varying meteorological conditions prevent from application of so far used Gaussian dispersion models, while the proposed model can handle these realistically. In the model, trajectories of several thousands of particles are computed and the distribution of virus concentration near the ground is calculated. This allows to assess risk of infection areas with respect to animal species of interest, such as cattle, swine or sheep. Meteorological input data like wind field and other variables necessary to compute turbulence were taken from the new pre-operational version of the non-hydrostatic numerical weather prediction model LMK (Lokal-Modell-Kürzestfrist) running at the German weather service DWD (Deutscher Wetterdienst). The LMK model provides meteorological parameters with a spatial resolution of about 2.8km. To account for the spatial resolution of 400m used by the Lagrangian particle model, the initial wind field is interpolated upon the finer grid by a mass consistent interpolation method. Case studies depict a significant influence of local wind systems on the spread of virus. Higher virus concentrations at the upwind side of the hills and marginal concentrations in the lee are well observable, as well as canalization effects by valleys. The study demonstrates that the Lagrangian particle model is an appropriate tool for risk assessment of airborne spread of virus by taking into account the realistic orographic and meteorological conditions.},

A source apportionment analysis was conducted using PM2.5 data collected from 1999 to 2002 by the Community Action Against Asthma (CAAA) project in Detroit, Michigan. CAAA used a community-based participatory research approach to identify and address the environmental triggers for asthma among children residing in southwest and east Detroit. The data used for the study included 24-h measurements of PM2.5 mass, elemental and organic carbon, and a suite of trace element species, along with hourly measurements of PM2.5 mass and black carbon. Positive matrix factorization (PMF2) was used to quantitatively apportion the sources of ambient PM2.5 at each of two Detroit community sites. Results showed that southwest Detroit PM2.5 levels can be apportioned to seven source categories: secondary sulfate/coal combustion, gasoline vehicles, diesel vehicles, refinery/oil combustion, iron–steel manufacturing/waste incineration, automotive electroplating, and sewage sludge incineration that includes crustal material from runoff. The PMF2 model apportioned the east Detroit PM2.5 data into five source categories: secondary sulfate/coal combustion, motor vehicles/combustion, refinery/oil combustion, iron–steel manufacturing/waste incineration, and automotive electroplating. For both locations, approximately over 60% of the PM2.5 mass was attributed to secondary sulfate/coal combustion sources, approximately 30% to vehicular sources, and 1–5% to local industrial sources. The unexplained mass accounted for <2% of the measured PM2.5 mass. This study illustrates that regional secondary sulfate/coal combustion and local motor vehicle emissions alone are enough for this mid-western US city to be in non-attainment for the annual PM2.5 NAAQS.},

The method includes collection of the particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10) using dichotomous Partisol 2025 sampler followed by extraction of the compounds into acidic solution, and pre-concentration of the compounds by percolating the air samples through the acidic solution, then ion-pair extraction of amines with bis-2-ethylhexylphosphate and derivatisation with isobutyl chloroformate prior to their GC-MS analysis in both electron impact and positive and negative ion chemical ionisation mode as their isobutyloxycarbonyl (isoBOC) derivatives. In the present study, ambient air and airborne particulate samples collected in Zonguldak province during summer and winter times of 2006–2007 were analysed for aliphatic and aromatic amines by the proposed method and the method was shown to be suitable for the simultaneous determination of these compounds at the levels of pgm−3 in air and airborne particulate samples. The seasonal distributions of bioactive amines in concentrations in ambient air and airborne PMs were evaluated as they are significant for the estimation of their effects on the environment and human health. The concentration levels of water soluble amines fluctuate significantly within a year with higher means and peak concentrations, probably due to the increased emissions from coal-fired domestic and central heating, in the winter times compared to the summer times. The results indicated that the relative amine content in particulates modulates with molecular mass and time of the year and the relative amine content especially in fine fractions of inhalable airborne particulates increases with the molecular mass of species but decreases with temperature.},

   abstract = {Objectives
To describe the degree of annoyance caused by air pollution and noise in pregnant women in a birth cohort; to determine the modifying factors and their relation with exposure to ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2).
Methods
The study population was 855 pregnant women in Valencia, Spain. Annoyance caused by air pollution and noise, and explanatory factors were obtained from 786 pregnant women through a questionnaire. NO2 levels were determined combining measurements at 93 points within the area of study and using geostatistical techniques (kriging).
Results
In all 7.9% of the women reported high annoyance caused by air pollution and 13.1% high annoyance caused by noise. There was a significant difference in the degree of annoyance due to both air pollution and noise depending on the area where the women lived and their working status. The degree of annoyance correlated better with measured NO2 at the municipality level (air pollution: r=0.53; noise: r=0.44) than at the individual level (air pollution and noise: r=0.21). On multivariate analysis, being a housewife, higher NO2 levels and high traffic density were associated with higher degrees of annoyance.
Conclusions
There was a high percentage of women who perceived medium–high annoyance due to noise and air pollution. Annoyance caused by environmental pollutants could lead to some psychological effects, which impair the quality of life, or even physiological ones, which affect prenatal development.},

Indoor concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and gaseous fluoride were measured. Additionally, we evaluated the factors that affected indoor concentrations of these gases, including the amount of fuel used as well as its sulfur content, the sulfur-emission ratio determined from the amount of sulfur retained in the combustion ash, and the combustion temperature in the stoves. The average 8-h and 24-h SO2 concentrations for L-BBs were nearly equal to or less than the World Health Organization's 40ppb guideline, whereas those for H-coal and H-BBs exceeded the guideline. The average 8-h SO2 concentrations for L-BBs were from 63 to 89% lower than those for H-coal, even though the 8-h average weight of fuel and its sulfur content for L-BBs were equal to those of H-coal. A chemical analysis of combustion ash indicated that the sulfur-emission ratio was from 26 to 48% for L-BBs, as compared with 86% for H-coal, and this difference resulted in reduction of indoor SO2 concentrations for L-BBs as compared with H-coal. Most of the 8-h average concentrations of CO and gaseous fluoride for all fuels were lower than the WHO guidelines. We concluded that BBs are a useful domestic fuel for the abatement of indoor air pollution.},

The specific objectives were: (i) to identify city areas with similar air pollution behaviours; and (ii) to locate emission sources. The statistical methods were applied to the mass concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3), collected in the AQMN of Oporto-MA from January 2003 to December 2005. It was demonstrated that for each pollutant the monitoring sites are grouped into different classes based on their air pollution behaviour. The sites were divided: (i) into three different groups for CO and for NO2 and (ii) into two groups for O3. It was also found that several monitoring sites covered city areas characterized by the same specific air pollution behaviour, suggesting then an ineffective management of the air quality-monitoring system. The redundant equipment should be transferred to other monitoring sites allowing enlargement of the monitored area. The conclusions obtained with the statistical methods were supported by the location of main emission sources through the analysis of the wind direction. Four main emission sources of CO and NO2 were located. Additionally, it was concluded that the sea wind had an important contribution towards the increase in the O3 concentration. For all pollutants, two sites were always coupled in one group due to the different air pollution behaviour presented in the analysed period.},

In particular, lead has recently been shown to be toxic in young children even at low levels previously considered ‘safe’. Lead poisoning from vehicle pollution has been addressed internationally by removal of leaded petrol but toxic blood lead levels in children continue to be reported in urban areas, the source suggested to be resuspended roadside soil, enriched in lead due to previous leaded fuel usage. Here, we use paired geochemical and magnetic analyses of natural biomonitors—kerbside tree leaves—and of air sample filters to examine contemporary sources of particulate pollution, and show that co-associated, fine (<1μm) lead- and iron-rich particles are emitted as vehicle-derived pollutants. Higher and strongly correlated lead, iron and magnetic remanence values were found closer to roads and on the road-proximal rather than road-distal sides of trees. Critically, highest pollutant values occurred on tree leaves next to uphill rather than downhill road lanes. The lead content of the leaf particulates was associated only with sub-micrometre, combustion-derived spherical particles. These results indicate that vehicle exhaust emissions, rather than resuspended soil dust, or tyre, brake or other vehicle wear are the major source of the lead, iron and magnetic loadings on roadside tree leaves. Analysis of leaves at different heights showed that leaf particulate lead and iron concentrations are highest at ∼0.3m (i.e. small child height) and at 1.5–2m (adult head height) above ground level; monitoring station collectors placed at 3m above the surface thus significantly under-estimate kerbside, near-surface lead concentrations. These results indicate that vulnerable groups, especially young children, continue to be exposed to fine, lead- and iron-rich, vehicle-derived particulates.},

The relationships are of the same quality that one can observe between transportation noise and noise annoyance. Other important findings are that the people become highly annoyed from air pollution at exposure values commonly occurring in European larger city areas and that lie below current European Union (EU) air pollution quality guideline values.

   abstract = {The contribution of air pollution on hospital admissions due to respiratory and heart diseases is a major issue in the health-environmental perspective. In the present study, an attempt was made to run down the relationships between air pollution levels and meteorological indexes, and corresponding hospital admissions in Athens, Greece. The available data referred to a period of eight years (1992–2000) including the daily number of hospital admissions due to respiratory and heart diseases, hourly mean concentrations of CO, NO2, SO2, O3 and particulates in several monitoring stations, as well as, meteorological data (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed/direction). The relations among the above data were studied through widely used statistical techniques (multivariate stepwise analyses) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Both techniques revealed that elevated particulate concentrations are the dominant parameter related to hospital admissions (an increase of 10μgm−3 leads to an increase of 10.2% in the number of admissions), followed by O3 and the rest of the pollutants (CO, NO2 and SO2). Meteorological parameters also play a decisive role in the formation of air pollutant levels affecting public health. Consequently, increased/decreased daily hospital admissions are related to specific types of meteorological conditions that favor/do not favor the accumulation of pollutants in an urban complex. In general, the role of meteorological factors seems to be underestimated by stepwise analyses, while ANNs attribute to them a more important role. Comparison of the two models revealed that ANN adaptation in complicate environmental issues presents improved modeling results compared to a regression technique. Furthermore, the ANN technique provides a reliable model for the prediction of the daily hospital admissions based on air quality data and meteorological indices, undoubtedly useful for regulatory purposes.},

   abstract = {Air pollution caused by the lime production industry has become a serious problem with potential effects to human health, especially in developing countries. Colombo is a city included in the Metropolitan Region of Curitiba (capital of Paraná State) in South Brazil. In Colombo city, a correlation has been shown between the lime production and the number of persons who need respiratory treatment in a local hospital, indicating that the lime industry can cause deleterious health effects in the exposed workers and population. This research was conducted to deal firstly with the characterization of the size distribution and chemical compositions of particles emitted from lime manufacturing and subsequently to assess the deposition rate of inhaled dolomitic lime aerosol particles in the human respiratory tract. The elemental chemical composition and particle size of individual atmospheric particles was quantitatively elucidated, including low-Z components like C, N and O, as well as higher-Z elements, using automated electron probe microanalysis. Information concerning the bulk composition is provided by energy-dispersive X-ray detection. The majority of the respirable particulate matter identified was composed of aluminosilicates, Ca–Mg oxides, carbon-rich particles, mixtures of organic particles and Ca–Mg carbonates, soot and biogenic particles. In view of the chemical composition and size distribution of the aerosol particles, local deposition efficiencies in the human respiratory system were calculated, revealing the deposition of CaO·MgO at extrathoracic, tracheobronchial and pulmonary levels. The results of this study offer evidence to the threat of the fine and coarse particles emitted from dolomite lime manufacturing, allowing policy-makers to better focus their mitigation strategies in an effective way, as well as to the dolomite producers for the purpose of designing and/or implementing improved emission controls.},

   abstract = {A high-volume cascade impactor, equipped with a PM10 inlet, was used to collect size-segregated aerosol samples during the summer of 2004 at two Portuguese locations: a coastal-rural area (Moitinhos) and an urban area (Oporto). Concentrations of airborne particulate matter (PM), total carbon (TC), organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) were determined for the following particle size ranges: <0.49, 0.49–0.95, 0.95–3.0, and 3.0–10 µm. The total PM mass concentrations at the urban and coastal-rural sites ranged from 22.8 to 79.6 μg m−3 and 19.9 to 28.2 μg m−3, respectively, and more than 56% of the total aerosol mass was found in the fractions below 3.0 μm. At both locations the highest concentrations of OC and EC were found in the submicrometer size range. The regional variability for the OC and EC concentrations, with the highest concentrations being found in the urban area, was related to the contribution of local primary sources (mostly traffic emissions). It was also verified an enrichment of the small size particles in WSOC, representing on average 37.3(±12.4)% and 59.7(±18.0)% of OC in the very fine aerosol at the coastal-rural and urban areas, respectively. The amount of secondary OC calculated by the minimum OC/EC ratio method indicates that secondary organic aerosol formation was important throughout the study at both sites. The obtained results suggest that long-range transport and favourable summer conditions for photochemical oxidation are key factors determining secondary OC formation in the coastal-rural and urban areas. The ultraviolet absorption properties of the chromophoric constituents of the WSOC fractions were also different among the different particle size ranges and also between the two sampling locations, thus suggesting the strong impact of the diverse emission sources into the composition of the size-segregated organic aerosol.},

Concentrations of ambient SO2 (sulfur dioxide), NO2, (nitrogen dioxide), NH3 (ammonia) and PM10 (particulate matter passing through a size selective impactor inlet with a 50% efficiency cut-off at 10 μm aerodynamic diameter) were measured once in a week for 24 h at selected residential and industrial sites and 8 h at a commercial site. The meteorological parameters (wind speed, wind direction, rainfall, temperature and relative humidity) were collected simultaneously from the Indian Meteorological Department, Kolkata. The daily average concentrations of SO2, NO2, NH3 and PM10 were observed to be 12.3±9.2, 32.5±14.2, 36.3±19.7 and 140.1±43.1 μg/m3 at the residential site, with 21.3±15.7, 49.9±9.8, 34.7±13.5 and 196.6±88.2 μg/m3 at the industrial site, respectively. The corresponding (8 h average) values at the commercial site were 15.5±11.9, 39.9±17.3, 33.9±13.3 and 276.1±71.4 μg/m3. Winter concentrations of ambient SO2, NO2, NH3 and PM10 were observed to be higher irrespective of the monitoring sites and duration of sampling, suggesting longer residence times of these pollutants in the atmosphere during winter due to stagnant conditions and low mixing heights. The SO2/NO2 ratios at the residential, commercial and industrial sites were found to be 0.38, 0.42 and 0.43, respectively. These low SO2/NO2 ratios are indicative of major emissions from mobile sources within the city. Spearman's rank correlation analysis showed an inverse relationship between the measured gaseous and particulate pollutant concentrations with the observed wind speed, rainfall, temperature and relative humidity. The data were analyzed using varimax-rotated principal component analysis for the residential and industrial sites. In principal component analysis three factors were drawn out of the seven variables, which represent 84% of the variance. The results show that local emissions dominate the concentration of SO2, NO2, NH3, and PM10. The major sources of emissions affecting this urban area include mobile sources along with contributions from industrial sources, coal-fired power plants and domestic heating.},

Specifically, Geographic Information Systems and spatial analytical techniques are used to map and measure survey respon- dents’ physical risk associated with expected climate change. Using existing spatial data, multiple measures of climate change vulnerability are analyzed along with demographic, attitudinal, and social contextual variables derived from a representative national survey to predict variation in risk perception. Bivariate correlation and multivariate regression analyses are used to identify and explain the most important indicators shaping individual risk perception. Analysis of the data suggests that the relationship between actual and per- ceived risk is driven by specific types of physical conditions and experiences.},

In this report, we explored the Caenorhabditis elegans to analyze the multiple toxicities of nickel and their possibly transferable properties. The nickel toxicity caused multiple biological defects in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, most of these toxicities could be transferred and could be only partially rescued in progeny. Some specific phenotypes in progeny were also found to exhibit no obvious rescue phenotypes or to show even more severe defects than their parents. The defects caused by nickel exposure could be classified into four groups according to their transferring properties. That is, the defects caused by nickel exposure could be largely, or partially, or unable to be rescued, or became even more severe in progeny animals. Therefore, most of the nickel exposure-caused defects can be transferred from parents to their progeny to different degrees in C. elegans.},

Root endpoints, reflecting root growth, were most sensitive in the toxicity tests, while endpoints relating to biomass, growth and shoot length were less sensitive. The endpoints with the lowest coefficients of variation were not necessarily the endpoints, which were toxicologically most sensitive. Differences in sensitivity were in the range of 10–1000 for different macrophyte-specific endpoints. No macrophyte species was consistently the most sensitive. Criteria to select endpoints in macrophyte toxicity tests should include toxicological sensitivity, variance and ecological relevance. Hence, macrophyte toxicity tests should comprise an array of endpoints, including very sensitive endpoints like those relating to root growth.},

Cr and Ni concentrated also in the coarse fraction, indicating a lithogenic contribution. An accumulation factor (AF) was calculated for the <2 and <10μm fraction. The AF values indicate that the accumulation in the finer fractions is higher where the overall contamination is lower. AF for Cr and Ni are particularly low in Glasgow and Torino.

The genotoxic activity of the PM10 material in the spring sample was exclusively associated with the induction of mitotic recombination, whereas the TSP genetic toxicity was due to both recombinational as well as point and/or chromosomal mutation events.

Short-term hydrocarbon exposure at the highest concentration significantly enhanced respiratory burst activity (RBA) in macrophages and decreased plasma lysozyme concentrations, however, subchronic exposure (4–57d) reduced RBA. Fish in the high exposure group were also less susceptible to the pathogen L. anguillarum following acute hydrocarbon exposure; however, this group was the most susceptible following subchronic exposures. These results are explained by a measured transient physiological stress response and long-term effects on ionoregulation. This study illustrates that hydrocarbon-elicited effects are dynamic and that toxic outcomes with respect to the teleost immune system depend on chemical concentrations and composition, exposure durations and the specific pathogen challenge.},

Bioavailability of soluble PM compounds like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and transition metals has been shown to play a key role in lung injury. We have previously characterized the size, shape, and chemical components of urban air particles from Buenos Aires (UAP-BA) and their biological impact on lungs. Herein, we evaluate the possible toxic effect of UAP-BA-soluble fraction (UAP-BAsf) on pulmonary cells obtained from young (1–2 months old) and aged (9–12 months old) Wistar rats using phagocytosis, oxidant–antioxidant generation, and apoptosis as endpoints. UAP-BA were collected in downtown BA and residual oil fly ash (ROFA), employed as a positive control, was collected from Boston Edison Co., Mystic Power Plant, Mystic, CT, USA. Both particle-soluble fractions (sf) were employed at concentrations ranging from 0 to 100μg/mL. UAP-BAsf and ROFAsf even at the lowest dose assayed (10μg/mL) showed in both lung cell populations the ability to stimulate phagocytosis and increase superoxide anion (O2−) generation. Both types of air particles caused a marked intracellular oxidant stress in aged pulmonary cells that may contribute to subsequent cell activation and production of proinflammatory mediators, leading to cell dysfunction. These data suggest that the impact of UAP-BAsf on phagocytosis, oxidant radical generation, and apoptosis is clearly dependent on the maturational state of the animal and might have different mechanisms of action.},

Complaints were screened to meet inclusion criteria (n=1190). Demographic characteristics of respondents were assessed as well as the types and severity of their symptoms. Geographic information systems (GIS) were used to examine spatial patterns in survey data. Illness complaints were commonly received in summer from heavily used California beaches. A strong correlation was observed between water quality impairment and the number of illness complaints in coastal counties (r=0.96, p<0.01). Respondents most commonly complained of gastrointestinal symptoms, infections of the sinuses and other upper respiratory ailments. Certain severe symptoms, such as high fevers, severe vomiting and/or diarrhea, seizures, swollen glands, and infections that did not heal properly were also reported. Approximately one-third of respondents sought the care of a physician for their symptoms; however, less than 1% reported being hospitalized. Our findings concerning the nature of the described symptoms as well as the observed seasonal and spatial patterns in the data are consistent with previously published findings of RWI in ocean bathers exposed to sewage and urban runoff. This method of rapid RWI data collection over the web could easily be adopted by health agencies for coordinated disease surveillance.},

   abstract = {Context and objective
Asthma among children is a major public health problem worldwide. There are increasing number of studies suggesting a possible association between allergenic pollen and exacerbations of asthma. In the context of global climate change, a number of future climate and air pollution scenarios predict increases in concentrations of pollen, an extension of the pollen season, and an increase in the allergenicity of pollen. The goal of the present study is to evaluate the short-term effects of exposure to grass and weed pollen on emergency department visits and readmissions for asthma among children aged 0–9 years living in Montreal between April and October, 1994–2004.
Methodology and results
Time-series analyses were carried out using parametric log-linear overdispersed Poisson models that were adjusted for temporal variations, daily weather conditions (temperature, atmospheric pressure), and gaseous air pollutants (ozone and nitrogen dioxide). We have found positive associations between emergency department visits and concentrations of grass pollen 3 days after exposure. The effect of grass pollen was higher on emergency department readmissions as compared to initial visits. Weak negative associations were found between weed pollen (including ragweed pollen) and emergency department visits 2 days after exposure.
Conclusion

   abstract = {Asthma disproportionately affects inner-city, minority children in the U.S. Outdoor pollutant concentrations, including particulate matter (PM), are higher in inner-cities and contribute to childhood asthma morbidity. Although children spend the majority of time indoors, indoor PM exposures have been less extensively characterized. There is a public health imperative to characterize indoor sources of PM within this vulnerable population to enable effective intervention strategies. In the present study, we sought to identify determinants of indoor PM in homes of Baltimore inner-city pre-school children. Children ages 2–6 (n=300) who were predominantly African-American (90%) and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds were enrolled. Integrated PM2.5 and PM10 air sampling was conducted over a 3-day period in the children's bedrooms and at a central monitoring site while caregivers completed daily activity diaries. Homes of pre-school children in inner-city Baltimore had indoor PM concentrations that were twice as high as simultaneous outdoor concentrations. The mean indoor PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations were 39.5±34.5 and 56.2±44.8μg/m3, compared to the simultaneously measured ambient PM2.5 and PM10 (15.6±6.9 and 21.8±9.53μg/m3, respectively). Common modifiable household activities, especially smoking and sweeping, contributed significantly to higher indoor PM, as did ambient PM concentrations. Open windows were associated with significantly lower indoor PM. Further investigation of the health effects of indoor PM exposure is warranted, as are studies to evaluate the efficacy of PM reduction strategies on asthma health of inner-city children.},

   abstract = {Background
Changes in climate systems are increasing heat wave frequency and air stagnation, both conditions associated with exacerbating poor air quality and of considerable public health concern.
Objectives
Heat and air pollution advisory systems are in place in many cities for early detection and response to reduce health consequences, or severity of adverse conditions. Whereas the ability to forecast heat waves and/or air pollution episodes has become increasingly sophisticated and accurate, little is known about the effectiveness of advisories in altering public behavior.
Methods
Air quality and meteorological conditions were measured during advisory and control days in Portland, OR and Houston, TX in 2005 and 2006 and 1962 subjects were interviewed by telephone about their perception and response to these conditions.
Results
Elevated ambient temperatures were accurately recognized regardless of air conditioning use; in Portland, respondents resorted to active cooling behavior (AC, fan, etc.), while in Houston no such change was observed. More heat-related symptoms were reported in Portland compared to Houston, probably due to low air conditioning use in the northwest. One-third of study participants were aware of air quality advisories but only ∼10–15% claimed to have changed activities during such an episode. Not the advisory, however, drove their behavior change, but rather the perception of poor air quality, which was not related to PM2.5 or ozone measurements.
Conclusions
Messages are not reaching the public during potentially hazardous weather and air quality conditions. Climatic forecasts are increasingly predictive but public agencies fail to mount an appropriate outreach response.},

Serum Clara cell protein concentrations were associated with both number of cigarettes smoked per day and number of pack-years of smoking. There was no evidence of an association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution, as assessed at each participant's home address, and serum concentrations of CC16. However, short-term variations in both ambient air pollution and temperature were associated with increases in serum Clara cell concentrations. All findings were robust when other factors were adjusted for. These findings suggest that acute environmental exposures may compromise the integrity of the lung epithelium and lead to increased epithelial barrier permeability in the lungs of elderly men.},

   abstract = {The impact of particle emissions by biomass burning is increasing throughout the world. We explored the toxicity of particulate matter produced by sugar cane burning and compared these effects with equivalent mass of traffic-derived particles. For this purpose, BALB/c mice received a single intranasal instillation of either distilled water (C) or total suspended particles (15μg) from an urban area (SP group) or biomass burning-derived particles (Bio group). Lung mechanical parameters (total, resistive and viscoelastic pressures, static elastance, and elastic component of viscoelasticity) and histology were analyzed 24h after instillation. Trace elements and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) metabolites of the two sources of particles were determined. All mechanical parameters increased similarly in both pollution groups compared with control, except airway resistive pressure, which increased only in Bio. Both exposed groups showed significantly higher fraction area of alveolar collapse, and influx of polymorphonuclear cells in lung parenchyma than C. The composition analysis of total suspended particles showed higher concentrations of PAHs and lower concentration of metals in traffic than in biomass burning-derived particles. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a single low dose of ambient particles, produced by traffic and sugar cane burning, induced significant alterations in pulmonary mechanics and lung histology in mice. Parenchymal changes were similar after exposure to both particle sources, whereas airway mechanics was more affected by biomass-derived particles. Our results indicate that biomass particles were at least as toxic as those produced by traffic.},

The purpose of this study was to identify and compare changes in HRV in positive or negative head-up tilt (HUT) participants. Fifty two subjects, 31 women and 21 men, 20–40 years old, underwent PM2.5 personal monitoring and Holter-ECG monitoring in supine and orthostatic position, during active standing, in indoor and outdoor environments. All measurements were made between 8 and 11 AM in the same geographical location (southeast of Mexico City). Frequency domain indexes were estimated in absolute (ms2) and in normalized units (nu) (low frequencies (LF), high frequencies (HF) and low/high frequency ratio (LF/HF)) in 5min periods by standard methods. Data were transformed into natural logarithmic scale (ln). Comparisons were made between genders and positive and negative HUT subjects. LF were larger and HF were smaller in negative HUT males. Multivariate analysis with GEE models, adjusted for each index, showed a significant decrease of HRV (LFln −0.194 95% CI, −0.4509, 0.0627, and HFln −0.298 95% CI, −0.5553, −0.0401) associated to an increase in PM2.5 air pollution in positive and negative HUT subjects which was larger for HFln in outdoor environments.

We included children under the age of 3 years who attended emergency room services for bronchiolitis (following standardized definition) during the period 1997–2001. Two series of data from 34 hospitals, the daily number of emergency hospital consultations (n=50857) and the daily number of hospitalizations (n=16588) for bronchiolitis, were analyzed using alternative statistical methods; these were the generalized additive model (GAM) and case-crossover models. After adjustments for public holidays, holidays and meteorological variables the case-crossover model showed that PM10, BS, SO2 and NO2 were positively associated with both consultations and hospitalizations. GAM models, adjusting for long-term trend, seasonality, holiday, public holiday, weekday and meteorological variables, gave similar results for SO2 and PM10. This study shows that air pollution may act as a trigger for the occurrence of acute severe bronchiolitis cases.},

   abstract = {There are acknowledged difficulties in epidemiological studies to accurately assign exposure to air pollution for large populations, and large, long-term cohort studies have typically relied upon data from central monitoring stations. This approach has generally been adequate when populations span large areas or diverse cities. However, when the effects of intra-urban differences in exposure are being studied, the use of these existing central sites are likely to be inadequate for representing spatial variability that exists within an urban area. As part of the Border Air Quality Strategy (BAQS), an international agreement between the governments of Canada and the United States, a number of air health effects studies are being undertaken by Health Canada and the US EPA. Health Canada's research largely focuses on the chronic exposure of elementary school children to air pollution. The exposure characterization for this population to a variety of air pollutants has been assessed using land-use regression (LUR) models. This approach has been applied in several cities to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), as an assumed traffic exposure marker. However, the models have largely been developed from limited periods of saturation monitoring data and often only represent one or two seasons. Two key questions from these previous efforts, which are examined in this paper, are: If NO2 is a traffic marker, what other pollutants, potentially traffic related, might it actually represent? How well is the within city spatial variability of NO2, and other traffic-related pollutants, characterized by a single saturation monitoring campaign. Input data for the models developed in this paper were obtained across a network of 54 monitoring sites situated across Windsor, Ontario. The pollutants studied were NO2, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and volatile organic compounds, which were measured in all four seasons by deploying passive samplers for 2-week periods. Correlations among these pollutants were calculated to assess what other pollutants NO2 might represent, and correlations across seasons for a given pollutant were determined to assess how much the within-city spatial pattern varies with time. LUR models were then developed for NO2, SO2, benzene, and toluene. A multiple regression model including proximity to the Ambassador Bridge (the main Canada—US border crossing point), and proximity to highways and major roads, predicted NO2 concentrations with an R2=0.77. The SO2 model predictors included distance to the Ambassador Bridge, dwelling density within 1500m, and Detroit-based SO2 emitters within 3000m resulting in a model with an R2=0.69. Benzene and toluene LUR models included traffic predictors as well as point source emitters resulting in R2=0.73 and 0.46, respectively. Between season pollutant correlations were all significant although actual concentrations for each site varied by season. This suggests that if one season were to be selected to represent the annual concentrations for a specific site this may lead to a potential under or overestimation in exposure, which could be significant for health research. All pollutants had strong inter-pollutant correlations suggesting that NO2 could represent SO2, benzene, and toluene.},

To evaluate the effect of short-term exposure to air pollutants on inflammation-sensitive biomarkers in apparently healthy individuals.
Methods
We enrolled all participants from The Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center inflammation survey held between 2003 and 2006, excluding participants with an acute or chronic inflammatory disease, pregnancy, steroidal or nonsteroidal treatment, or a recent invasive procedure. Additional subjects were excluded for living more than 11km from the nearest air pollution monitoring station. Analysis was performed separately for men and women. Linear regression models were fitted for each inflammatory variable against air pollutant variables (particulate matter under 10μm, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone) for increasing lag times of up to 7 days, and adjusted for all possible and known confounding parameters.
Results
The study population comprised 3659 individuals (2203 males and 1456 females). We found a statistically significant negative correlation in the male population between air pollutants, mainly NO2, SO2, and CO, and fibrinogen in several lag days. A positive correlation was found for PM10 at day 7. No such correlation was found for CRP and WBC, or for the female population.
Conclusion
Our findings do not support the potential link between short-term exposure to air pollution and enhanced inflammation as a possible explanation for increased cardiovascular morbidity. Additional large-scale population-based studies with good methodological design are needed in order to clarify this issue.},

Respiratory diseases constitute one of the leading causes of ill health among children in New York State (NYS). The current project, a component of the NYS Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, investigated a potential association between ambient ozone (O3) concentration and childhood respiratory hospital admissions over 11 years in NYS.
Methods
We used a two-stage Bayesian hierarchical model to assess the exposure–disease associations within 11 geographic regions and statewide. The data included total daily hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases for children 0–17 years old from 1991 to 2001 in NYS (N=134,099) and daily ambient O3 level with different single-day lags. These analyses adjusted for particulate matter ⩽10μm in size (PM10), meteorological conditions, day of the week, seasonality, long-term trends, and demographic characteristics.
Results
In 5 of the 11 regions, including the Upper and Lower Adirondacks, Upper Hudson Valley, Staten Island, and New York City, positive associations were found between respiratory hospital admissions and ambient O3 level 2 days prior to the admission. Applying different statistical methods and sensitivity analysis of PM10 did not alter these findings. When region-specific results were combined, no statewide association was apparent.
Conclusions
Geographic differences were found in the associations between O3 levels and respiratory hospital admissions among children. In addition, we found that the two-stage model may be an appropriate approach for tracking the health effects of air pollution over time in different geographic areas when heterogeneity of risk factors across regions is present.},

We included 24,357 Hong Kong Chinese aged 30 or above who died of natural causes in 1998. Information on individual socioeconomic characteristics was obtained by interviewing proxy informants with a standardized questionnaire in all four death registries. Individual SES was indicated by three measures: type of housing, occupational group and education attainment. Poisson regression was performed to assess the short-term effects of ambient air pollution measured by PM10, NO2, SO2 and O3 on mortality for each SES group. The differences in the effects between SES groups were estimated by the interaction between air pollution and SES. We found that PM10 and NO2 were associated with greater risk of mortality on people living in public rental housing than in private housing. The effects of all four pollutants were significantly greater in blue-collar workers than the never-employed and white-collar groups (p<0.05). However, we found no compelling evidence of effect modification by education attainment. Our results provide new evidence on the role of individual's SES as effect modifiers of the short-term effects of air pollution on mortality. The reduction of risks associated with air pollution for socially disadvantaged populations should be a high priority in public health and environmental policies.},

This study analyzes the impact of high temperatures on mortality in Sydney, Australia, during the warmer six months (October–March) between 1993 and 2004, using the underlying and associated cause of death due to all-cause, circulatory, and respiratory disease. Some mortality datasets were also divided into two age groups, 0–64 and 65+. A generalized linear model assuming negative binomial distribution was constructed for the daily mortality counts using daily maximum temperature and hourly maximum concentrations of ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM10) as covariates. With the air pollution terms in a model, the change in mortality was estimated to be between 4.5% and 12.1% for a 10°C increase in maximum daily temperature, depending on mortality dataset. When air pollutants were removed from a model, the above mortality percentages changed by −1.1% to 0.9%. When both underlying and associated causes of death were considered, the effect remained the same or became lower. Maximum temperature has been found to have a significant effect on mortality in Sydney, with PM10 and O3 confounding the association.},

In the USA, nationally representative health data are collected in the NHIS and annual air quality data are collected by the EPA. The linkage of these data for research is not straightforward and the choices made may introduce bias into results. The 2000–2003 NHIS and air quality data for six air pollutants were linked by residential block group and monitor location, which differ by pollutants. For each pollutant, three annual exposure variables were assigned to respondents: (1) average of all monitors in the county, (2) of monitors within a 5-mile radius of the distance between block group and monitor, and (3) within a 20-mile radius. Exposure estimates, study sample characteristics, and association between fine particle exposure and respondent-reported health status were compared for different geographic linkage methods. The results showed that study sample characteristics varied by geographic linkage method and pollutant linked. Generally, the fewer the NHIS respondents linked, the higher is the pollution exposure and lower is the percentage of non-Hispanic whites. After adjustment for sociodemographic and geographic factors, associations between fine particles and health status were generally comparable across study samples. Because exposure information is not available for all potential participants in an epidemiological study, selection effects should be considered when drawing inferences about air quality–health associations. With the current monitoring data system, the study sample is substantially reduced when linkage to multiple pollutants is performed.},

Our outcome variables include emergency visits for ischaemic heart diseases (ICD-9-CM 410-411, 414), cerebrovascular diseases (ICD-9-CM 430-437), and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (ICD-9-CM 493, 496) from the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). We use simple paired t-test and Poisson regression models to compare difference in emergency visits, air pollution levels and meteorological conditions for the pairs of Asian dust events and pre-dust periods. There were 39 high dust events with PM10 greater than 90μg/m3 and another 46 low dust events with PM10 less than 90μg/m3. Compared to their pre-dust periods, PM10 concentrations are significantly increased by 77μg/m3 per event for the high dust events. Asian dust storms increase cardiopulmonary emergency visits during storm-affecting periods in Taipei when ambient PM10 concentrations are above 90μg/m3. Compared to their pre-dust periods, emergency visits for ischaemic heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and COPD during high dust events are increased by 0.7 case (35%), 0.7 case (20%), and 0.9 case (20%) per event, respectively, by paired t-tests. By comparing the model-predicted to the observed emergency visits, we find emergency visits for cardiovascular diseases (ICD-9-CM 410-411, 414, 430-437) were significantly increased by 2.9 cases (67%) per event for the 39 high Asian dust events.},

   abstract = {Background: Exposure to environmental hazards contributes to many chronic diseases, yet the magnitude of their contribution to the total disease burden in Canada is not well understood. Objectives: To estimate the environmental burden of disease (EBD) in Canada for respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and congenital affliction. Quantifying the contribution of environmental exposures to the overall burden of disease could play an important role in shaping public health and environmental policy priorities. Methods: The World Health Organization (WHO) recently estimated the environmental burden of disease globally by using a combination of comparative risk assessment data and expert judgment to develop environmentally attributable fractions (EAFs) of mortality and morbidity for 85 categories of disease. We use the EAFs developed by the WHO, EAFs developed by other researchers, and data from Canadian public health institutions to provide an initial estimate of the environmental burden of disease in Canada for four major categories of disease. Results: Our results indicate that: 10,000-25,000 deaths; 78,000-194,000 hospitalizations; 600,000-1.5 million days spent in hospital; 1.1 million-1.8 million restricted activity days for asthma sufferers; 8000-24,000 new cases of cancer; 500-2500 low birth weight babies; and between $3.6 billion and $9.1 billion in costs occur in Canada each year due to respiratory disease, cardiovascular illness, cancer, and congenital affliction associated with adverse environmental exposures. Conclusions: The burden of illness in Canada resulting from adverse environmental exposures is significant. Stronger efforts to prevent adverse environmental exposures are warranted, including research, education, and regulation. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The UK is witnessing a new line in political debate around new nuclear energy generation as one potential feature of future energy policy, specifically for contributing to climate change mitigation alongside energy security. Little is known about how ordinary citizens might be responding to this reframing. This paper reports the results from a major British survey (n=1491) undertaken in the autumn of 2005. The consistent message is that while higher proportions of the British public are prepared to accept nuclear power if they believe it contributes to climate change mitigation, this is a highly conditional view, with very few actively preferring this over renewable sources given the choice. People see both climate change and nuclear power as problematic in terms of risks and express only a 'reluctant acceptance' of nuclear power as a 'solution' to climate change. The combined data from this survey can also be interpreted as an indication of the complexity surrounding beliefs about energy futures and the difficulty of undertaking simplistic risk-risk tradeoffs within any single framing of the issues; such as nuclear energy versus climate change. The results also indicate that it would be unwise, in the UK as elsewhere, to simplistically assume that there exists any single or stable public 'opinion' on such complex matters. We conclude with a discussion of the role and implications of the survey evidence for the policy process. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Background and objective
Patients’ perception of asthma triggers has been explored in a largely unstructured fashion in the past. Therefore, we developed the Asthma Trigger Inventory (ATI), a questionnaire that allows for a psychometrically valid measurement of patients’ perceived asthma triggers. Here we evaluate a German language version of the ATI and studied the relationship of subscales with self-reported health status, health care use, psychopathology, and results of allergy skin testing.
Method
Data were obtained from 370 asthma patients recruited from the community, primary care, and in-patient asthma treatment and education.
Results
Analysis revealed a five-factor structure that largely confirmed results with the English original. Reliability was good to satisfactory (Cronbach's α=0.77–0.89) for allergy, exercise, air pollution/irritants, infection, and psychological trigger subscales. In hierarchical regression analysis adjusting for demographics and asthma severity, asthma patients with stronger non-allergic triggers showed less physical and mental well-being and more asthma-related health care use. Psychological triggers showed unique associations with anxious and depressed mood. Pollen and animal allergen scores of the ATI were significantly related to skin test results for relevant allergens. Non-allergic but not allergic triggers showed substantial associations with asthma control.
Conclusion
The German version of the ATI reliably measures asthma patients’ trigger perceptions. Non-specific asthma triggers exert a greater burden on patients’ well-being and primary health care use.},

Background
Prior studies suggest that obesity may cause asthma. Obesity and asthma are prevalent in low-income urban neighborhoods, but the impact of obesity on asthma in such neighborhoods has not been examined.
Methods
The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene surveyed 6119 adults age 18–54 years in 2002. Obesity was defined as body mass index≥30kg/m2 and current asthma as physician diagnosed asthma plus recent symptoms. We calculated prevalence (risk) differences (RD) and population attributable risk percents (PAR%).
Results
Obese individuals had a 2.0% (95% CI: 0.5%, 3.6%; p=0.01) higher risk of current asthma than normal weight individuals overall. Obesity was more common in low-income neighborhoods compared with middle-to-upper-income neighborhoods (23% vs. 14%, p<0.001), as was current asthma (6% vs. 4%, respectively, p=0.02). The risk of current asthma associated with obesity was similar in low-income (RD: 1.3%, 95% CI: −1.5%, 4.0%; p=0.36) and middle-to-upper-income neighborhoods (RD: 2.0%, 95% CI: 0.1%, 3.9%; p=0.04). The PAR% for asthma due to obesity was not greater in low-income (7.3%) than in middle-to-upper-income neighborhoods (7.7%).
Conclusions
It is unlikely that the excess asthma prevalence in urban low-income neighborhoods is disproportionately attributable to obesity. Instead, alternative causes of excess asthma should be sought.},

Objectives
COPD exacerbations are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study evaluated the effect of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 and salmeterol 50μg twice daily on moderate to severe exacerbations.
Methods
Patients received standardized treatment with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 during a 1-month run-in, followed by randomization to fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 or salmeterol for 12months. Moderate to severe exacerbations were defined as worsening symptoms of COPD requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids, antibiotics, or hospitalization.
Results
In 782 patients with COPD (mean FEV1=0.94±0.36L, 33% predicted normal), treatment with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 significantly reduced (1) the annual rate of moderate to severe exacerbations by 30.5% compared with salmeterol (1.06 and 1.53 per subject per year, respectively, p<0.001), (2) the risk of time to first exacerbation by 25% (hazard ratio=0.750, p=0.003) and (3) the annual rate of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids by 40% (p<0.001). Clinical improvements observed during run-in treatment with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 were better maintained over 12months with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 than salmeterol. Adverse events were reported for a similar percentage of subjects across groups. A higher reporting of pneumonia was observed with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 than salmeterol (7% vs. 4%).
Conclusions
We conclude that fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 is more effective than salmeterol at reducing the rate of moderate to severe exacerbations over 1year. The benefits of this reduction relative to the risk of a higher incidence of reported pneumonia should be considered. This study supports the use of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 for the reduction of COPD exacerbations in patients with COPD.},

Objective
In China, significant levels of environmental pollution, substandard worksite quality and high rates of smoking predispose the population to potentially high risks of respiratory illnesses and other diseases. We assessed the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and their risks in relation to personal, occupational and environmental risk factors in a heavy-industry province of northeastern China.
Methods
Lifestyle, health, residential and occupational data were obtained in 2002 from 31,704 adults of six cities in Liaoning, China, using self-assessment questionnaires. General linear and multi-level models were used to evaluate prevalence rates and risks of respiratory symptoms, related to both individual and combined exposures to environmental and occupational risk factors.
Results
The crude prevalence rates (PRs) for persistent cough, persistent phlegm, wheeze and asthma were 2.3, 3.8, 2.1 and 1.0%, respectively. The odds ratios (ORs) of all four respiratory symptoms examined were increased by: smoking (ORs from 2.06 to 5.02), occupational dust (ORs from 1.35 to 1.72), occupational gas (ORs from 1.48 to 1.72) and presence of irritating smoke during cooking (ORs from 1.54 to 2.22). An index combining proximity of residence to road, factory or chimney, indoor coal use and presence of irritating smoke during cooking was associated with up to 3.9-fold increased risks of all symptoms. Increasing values of each risk factor were generally associated with dose–response trends in prevalence rates and risks (all p for trend <0.01).
Conclusion
The crude PRs of symptoms were lower than those reported by European and American studies but closer to those of previous Chinese studies. The risks of respiratory symptoms in this population were increased by smoking, occupational exposures to dust and gas, and combined residence-related exposures such as living close to a main road, factory or chimney, indoor coal use and the presence of irritating smoke during cooking, among other risk factors.},

Objective
The possible effect of the various meteorological variables on the incidence of upper and lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs) has intrigued the scientific community for decades.
Methods
We performed a retrospective analysis regarding the association between meteorological variables and clinical data for upper and lower RTIs in the area of Attica, Greece.
Results
There was a statistically significant (P<0.001) negative correlation between weekly average temperature with the proportion of weekly house call visits resulting in a diagnosis of upper or lower RTIs 4 days later (R=−0.56 and −0.71 for upper and lower RTIs, respectively) as well as 7 days later (R=−0.57 and −0.71 for upper and lower RTIs, respectively) and during the same day (R=−0.55 and −0.68 for upper and lower RTIs, respectively). In addition, there was a negative correlation between weekly wind chill average (and minimum) temperature as well as a positive correlation of relative humidity with upper and lower RTIs. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between wind speed and upper or lower RTIs.
Conclusions
The findings suggest that house call visits due to upper and lower RTIs increased as the average temperature in the area of Attica decreased.},

Background
Research and practice indicate that a sizeable amount of prescribed drugs is never used.
Aim
To assess the habitual up-take of medicines in subjects with respiratory symptoms/diseases or impaired lung function in general population samples.
Methods
Data regard 4010 subjects (8–88 years) from the rural area of Po River Delta (North Italy) and the urban area of Pisa (North-Central Italy). Analyses concern the habitual use of any or specific medicines (broncho-pulmonary, anti-allergic, cardio-vascular, diuretic) in subjects with asthma, chronic bronchitis/emphysema (COPD), COPD or chronic cough/phlegm (COPDsx), and airways obstruction (AO, FEV1/FVC<70%).
Results
Asthma, COPD, COPDsx, and AO were present in 6%, 5%, 21%, and 13% of cases, respectively. Only 37% and 21% of subjects with respiratory symptoms/diseases used any or specific medicines, respectively. The subjects with COPD exhibited the highest prevalence of assumption (59% for any drug, 38% for specific medicines), followed by asthmatics (42% and 30%), and subjects with AO (40% and 25%). After accounting for sex, age, residence area, smoking habit, education, and presence of comorbidity, the conditions significantly related to any medicine up-take were COPD (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.08–2.53) and asthma (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.01–2.12). Only asthma resulted significantly associated with the use of specific drugs (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.94–4.97). Drug use was higher in the urban than in the rural area.
Conclusion
The results indicate that most people in the general population do not use drugs, in spite of reported respiratory disorders. The underuse of medicines seems lower in the urban area.},

Objectives
There is evidence suggesting that secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is causally linked to adverse respiratory effects. We examined the relations between the exposure to SHS and radiological signs in chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).
Methods
Asbestos-exposed workers (n=633) were imaged with HRCT, primarily to investigate potential occupational lung disease. After excluding current smokers, the study population included 361 ex- and 141 never-smokers. They answered a questionnaire on occupational exposures, smoking habits and SHS exposure. HRCT images were assessed for emphysema, ground-glass, irregular/linear and rounded opacities, honeycombing and several other signs. Regression analyses were adjusted for asbestos exposure, ex-smoking, age, body mass index and potential reader effect.
Results
Due to missing data the multivariate analyses were restricted to 310 participants aged 47.5–87.0 years. Their lifetime SHS exposure ranged between 0 and 193.5 pack-years (mean 23.5), and exposure in the past 12 months 0–30 packs (0.43). Total (B=0.005, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 0.002–0.008, p=0.000) and workplace (B=0.006, 95% CI 0.003–0.009, p=0.001) cumulative SHS exposures were significantly related to ground-glass opacities. Total SHS exposure in the last 12 months (B=0.027, 95% CI 0.000–0.054, p=0.048) and workplace exposure (B=0.027, 95% CI 0.000–0.054, p=0.048) were also significantly related to ground-glass opacities. Positive effects of SHS were also detected on irregular/linear opacities.
Conclusions
SHS exposure in the last 12 months and over lifetime significantly increases ground-glass opacity in HRCT, suggesting an early or subclinical desquamative interstitial pneumonia/respiratory bronchiolitis. This study further supports that SHS has adverse effects on the lungs that can be detected by X-ray methods.},

   abstract = {In humans, immune development begins early in embryonic life and continues throughout the early postnatal period. Although a number of pesticides have been observed to induce developmental immunotoxicity in mice, few human studies have examined the long term effects of in utero pesticide exposure on childhood morbidity. Empirical evidence suggests that the vulnerable period for toxic insults to the developing immune system extends from early gestation to adolescence in humans and animals. Using data from the Ontario Farm Family Health Study, we examined the relationship between farm couple exposures to pesticides during pregnancy and subsequent health outcomes in their offspring, including: persistent cough or bronchitis, asthma, and allergies or hayfever. No strong associations between pesticide exposures during pregnancy and persistent cough or bronchitis, or asthma were found. There was suggestive evidence that allergies and hayfever appeared to be more common in offspring, especially male offspring, exposed to certain specific pesticides during the period of pregnancy. Nevertheless, given the indirect indicators of pesticide exposure used in this study, and the scarcity of human studies on in utero exposure to pesticides and the development of allergies and other child health outcomes, these findings serve primarlily to generate hypotheses for future research. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However, these relationships have rarely been studied in São Paulo, Brazil. Methods: From 1996 to 2000, biometeorological indices including meteorological variables such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind were used to measure thermal comfort in elderly people mortality (>65 years old), and CVD was quantified. Results: Statistical analysis showed a significant negative loading between CVD and meteorological variables as well as thermal comfort indices. The CVD curve was a U-shaped, showing higher value for cold stress than for heat stress. The results clearly show seasonal variations in CVD mortality rates, which were higher in winter. Meteorological variables were found to play an important role as well as through the thermal comfort indices. The air pollutants, PM10 and SO2, except ozone, presented positive loadings with CVD, albeit less than statistically significant. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {In Asia, limited literature has been published on the association between daily mortality and ambient air pollution. We examined the associations of daily cause-specific mortality with daily mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with a mass median aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM10) in Wuhan, China using 4 years of data (2001-2004). There are approximately 4.5 million residents in Wuhan who live in the city core area of 201 km2 where air pollution levels are higher and pollution ranges are wider than the majority of cities in the published literature. We use quasi-likelihood estimation within the context of the generalized additive models (GAMs) (natural spline (NS) models in R) to model the natural logarithm of the expected daily death counts as a function of the predictor variables. We found consistent PM10 effects on mortality with the strongest effects on lag 0 day. Every 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 daily concentration at lag 0 day was significantly associated with an increase in non-accidental (0.36%; 95% CI 0.19-0.53%), cardiovascular (0.51%; 95% CI 0.28-0.75%), stroke (0.44%; 95% CI 0.16-0.72%), cardiac (0.49%; 95% CI 0.08-0.89%), respiratory (0.71%; 95% CI 0.20-1.23%), and cardiopulmonary (0.46%; 95% CI 0.23-0.69%). In general, these effects were stronger among the elderly (≥65 years or ≥45 years) than among the young. The exploration of exposure-response relationships between PM10 and cause-specific mortality suggests the appropriateness of assuming linear relationships, where the PM10 concentration in Wuhan ranged from 24.8 to 477.8 μg/m3. We conclude that there is consistent evidence of acute effects of PM10 on cardiopulmonary mortality. A linear no threshold exposure-response relationship is suggested between PM10 and the studied cause-specific mortality. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Among early-life environmental factors, parental smoking (ETS) has been associated with adverse respiratory outcomes in children. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether parental smoking might lead to asthma and allergies taking into account family history of asthma, personal atopy, breast feeding as confounders and owing pets and day-care during the first 6 months of life as modifiers. About 9000 children of fourth and fifth grade were selected in six cities of France. About 7798 answered an epidemiological questionnaire, underwent a medical examination including skin prick test positivity to common allergens, skin examination for eczema, and run test to assess exercise-induced asthma (EIA). Prevalence of allergies was, respectively, 25.2% for eczema, 12.9% for rhinitis, 9.9% for asthma and 25% for atopy. About 8.3% had an EIA. About 21.6% of children were exposed to maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy. Maternal smoking, in utero and later, was significantly related to lifetime wheezing (odds ratio (OR): 1.24[1.10-1.56]) and asthma (OR: 1.22[1.04-1.66]). There was no association between atopy, rhinitis, eczema and parental smoking, respectively. ETS remains a risk factor of wheezing in childhood. Counselling parents of children to quit smoking still remains a public health policy. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Fine particulate matter has been linked to allergies by experimental and epidemiological data having used aggregated data or concentrations provided by fixed-site monitoring stations, which may have led to misclassification of individual exposure to air pollution. Methods: A semi-individual design was employed to relate individual data on asthma and allergy of 5338 school children (10.4±0.7 years) attending 108 randomly chosen schools in 6 French cities to the concentrations of PM2.5 (fine particles with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm) assessed in proximity of their homes. Children underwent a medical visit including skin prick test (SPT) to common allergens, exercise-induced bronchial (EIB) reactivity and skin examination for flexural dermatitis. Their parents filled in a standardised health questionnaire. Results: After adjustment for confounders and NO2 as a potential modifier, the odds of suffering from EIB and flexural dermatitis at the period of the survey, past year atopic asthma and SPT positivity to indoor allergens were significantly increased in residential settings with PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 10 μg/m3 (WHO air quality limit values). The relationships were strengthened in long-term residents (current address for at least 8 years). Conclusions: Findings support the hypothesis that changes in allergy prevalence observed in recent decades might be partly related to interactions between traffic-related air pollution and allergens. Further longitudinal investigations are needed to corroborate such results. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Air pollutants are associated with adverse respiratory effects mainly in susceptible groups. This study was designed to assess the impact of the ionic composition of particulate matter on asthmatic respiratory functions in São Paulo city. From May to July 2002, fine and coarse particulate matter fractions were collected and their respective chemical composition with respect to major ions (Na+, Mg2+, K+, Ca2+, NH4+, Cl-, NO3- and SO42-) were determined in each aqueous-extract fraction. The results showed predominant concentrations of SO42- (48.4%), NO3- (19.6%) and NH4+ (12.5%) in the fine fraction, whereas NO3- (35.3%), SO42- (29.1%), Ca2+ (13.1%) and Cl- (12.5%) were the predominant species in the coarse fraction. The association between the chemical components of both fractions and the daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements (morning and evening) of the 33 asthmatic individuals were assessed through a linear mixed-effects model. The results showed a significant negative correlation (decrease of PEF) between morning PEF and coarse chloride (3-day moving average) and between evening PEF and coarse Na+ (3-day moving average), coarse Mg2+ (3-day moving average) and coarse NH4+ (2- and 3-day moving average). A significant negative correlation has also been observed between morning and evening PEF and Mg2+ in the fine fraction. These results suggest that some particle chemical constituents may increase the responsiveness of airways and that coarse particles that deposit in the upper airways may be more relevant for asthmatic response and irritation. However, the results do not prove a clear causal relationship. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Current standards for fine particulates and nitrogen dioxide are under revision. Patients with cardiovascular disease have been identified as the largest group which need to be protected from effects of urban air pollution. Methods: We sought to estimate associations between indicators of urban air pollution and daily mortality using time series of daily TSP, PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, O3 and nontrauma deaths in Vienna (Austria) 2000-2004. We used polynomial distributed lag analysis adjusted for seasonality, daily temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and incidence of influenza as registered by sentinels. Results: All three particulate measures and NO2 were associated with mortality from all causes and from ischemic heart disease and COPD at all ages and in the elderly. The magnitude of the effect was largest for PM2.5 and NO2. Best predictor of mortality increase lagged 0-7 days was PM2.5 (for ischemic heart disease and COPD) and NO2 (for other heart disease and all causes). Total mortality increase, lagged 0-14 days, per 10 μg m-3 was 2.6% for PM2.5 and 2.9% for NO2, mainly due to cardiopulmonary and cerebrovascular causes. Conclusion: Acute and subacute lethal effects of urban air pollution are predicted by PM2.5 and NO2 increase even at relatively low levels of these pollutants. This is consistent with results on hospital admissions and the lack of a threshold. While harvesting (reduction of mortality after short increase due to premature deaths of most sensitive persons) seems to be of minor importance, deaths accumulate during 14 days after an increase of air pollutants. The limit values for PM2.5 and NO2 proposed for 2010 in the European Union are unable to prevent serious health effects. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Dust events are common air pollution events in parts of the world with arid, semi-arid, or desert areas. There is little research on the association between respiratory and cardiovascular health and dust events in places which are close to the deserts. The aim of this study is to evaluate the health effects of dust events in a location where traffic and industry are underdeveloped and dust events are most frequent in China. The setting allows the opportunity to reduce confounding by anthropogenically derived particulate matter and to confirm the health effects of dust events. The present study was done using daily counts of hospitalizations in Minqin (1994-2003) for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth revision) for males and females. Using a semi-parametric generalized additive model and controlling for long-term temporal trends, day of the week, meteorological factors, and seasonal influence, counts of hospitalization were analyzed for dust events in a Poisson regression. Relative risks (RRs) were used to estimate the risk of dust events for respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations. In the year-round model, dust events with a lag of 3 days were significantly associated with total respiratory hospitalization for males and females, with RRs of 1.14 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.29) and 1.18 (95% CI 1.00-1.41); dust events with a lag of 4 days were significantly associated with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in males (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04-1.59), and dust events with a lag of 6 days were significantly associated with pneumonia in males, with an RR of 1.17 (95% CI 1.00-1.38). A significant association between dust events with a lag of 3 days and hypertension in males was also found (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03,1.64). In the seasonal analysis model, the associations between the dust events and respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations were stronger in spring and in winter, respectively. The results show the health effects of dust events on respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations, and the characteristic seasonal distribution of the health effects. In addition, the health effects of dust events are consistent with recent animal and human data showing the respiratory and cardiovascular effects of particulate matter. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {We hypothesized that aggregates of ultrafine carbon and washed diesel particles impair the ability of alveolar macrophages (AM) to kill bacteria and enhance the AM lipid peroxidation (LPO) of lung surfactant. Rat AM were exposed, 5 h, to particles 20 μg/ml. The AM, containing carbon or washed diesel particles, were incubated 2 h, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, an American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strain or clinical isolates. Surviving bacteria were quantified. Surfactant was incubated, 5 h, with carbon or washed diesel loaded AM and LPO was measured. The particle load was approximately 1 μg/106 AM, representing accepted exposure to ambient particles in Europe. Metal concentrations were 10 to 100 fold higher in washed diesel-than in carbon particles. There was a dose dependent increase in bacterial survival with carbon-loaded macrophages, but not with washed diesel-loaded AM. Clinical isolates had a higher survival rate with carbon-loaded macrophages than the ATCC strain. Surfactant LPO was increased with washed diesel-loaded macrophages (95%) and with carbon-loaded macrophages (55%) compared to controls. High LPO caused by washed diesel-loaded AM reflects their increased oxidative metabolism, probably caused by particle metals. The additional oxygen metabolites maintained bactericidal activity of AM, while corresponding activity was decreased in carbon-loaded AM. Altered functions of AM may explain health problems related to air pollution. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

All generated estimating equations models were adjusted for season, year, weekends, temperature, wind speed, and precipitation. Relative to the days with PM10 mass concentration ≤13 μg/m3, a significant 9.3% increase (RR: 1.093, 95% CI: 1.004-1.191) in the rate of outpatient visits for asthma occurred during days with PM10 of 20-33 μg/m3. No further dose-response occurred for days with PM10 ≥34 μg/m3. A significant 18.1% increase (RR: 1.181, 95% CI: 1.010-1.381) in the rate of quick-relief medication prescriptions occurred during days with PM10 of 34-60 μg/m3, and a 28.8% increase (RR: 1.288, 95% CI: 1.026-1.619) occurred during days with PM10≥61 μg/m3. Similar results for outpatient asthma visits and quick-relief medication occurred in weekly models. There were no significant associations with PM2.5 in either daily or weekly models. These subtle but statistically significant associations suggest that non-industrial, geologic sources of PM10 may have measurable health effects at levels below current national standards. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Using geographical information systems (GIS) tools, the present study analyzed the association between children's lung function development and their long-term exposure to air pollution. The study covered the cohort of 1492 schoolchildren living in the vicinity of a major coal-fired power station in the Hadera sub-district of Israel. In 1996 and 1999, the children underwent subsequent pulmonary function tests (PFT) (forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume during the first second (FEV1)), and the children's parents completed a detailed questionnaire on their health status and household characteristics. A negative association was found between changes in the results of PFT and the estimated individual levels of air pollution. A sensitivity test revealed a FEV1 decline from -4.3% for the average pollution level to -10.2% for the high air pollution level. The results of a sensitivity test for FVC were found to be similar. Association with the reported health status was found to be insignificant. As we conclude, air pollution from a coal-fired power station, although not exceeding local pollution standards, had a negative effect on children's lung function development. As argued, previous studies carried out in the region failed to show the above association because they were based on zone approaches that assign average concentration levels of air pollutants to all individuals in each zone, leading to a misclassification bias of individual exposure. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Asthma is an important public health challenge. The objective of this research was to investigate the relationship of air pollution and weather to adolescent asthma prevalence and attack rate. A 6-month mass screening asthma study was conducted from October 1995 to March 1996 in Taiwan. The study population included junior high school students from throughout the country (1,139,452 students). Eighty-nine percent of students completed questionnaires (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood-ISAAC and New England Core Questionnaires) and passed a logical screening error program. Lung function data was collected to assist in the diagnosis of asthma status. From the students screened during this mass survey, a stratified random sample of 64,660 students was analyzed for asthma prevalence and attack rate. Using a regression model to compare the USEPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards 2000 (NAAQS, 2000) to asthma prevalence, this investigation found that the standards may not provide enough protection for adolescents after controlling for age, rhinitis, eczema, urban birth location, parental education level, exercise, cigarette smoking, environmental tobacco smoking, alcohol beverage consumption and weather factors. The general estimating equations (GEE) model, a repeated measurement regression model, was used to examine the relationship between the monthly asthma attack rate among asthma patients and air pollution (nitrogen oxides; nitrogen dioxide; nitric oxide; Ozone; PM10) while controlling for household smoking. The GEE model demonstrated that air pollution is related to asthma attack rate. Air pollution factors also interacted with weather parameters when related to asthma attack rate. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Atmospheric particulate matter (PM), an ingredient of urban pollution matter, is a mixture of solid and liquid particles differing in origin, dimension and composition. There is big concern about inhaled PM in urban areas, especially due to its adverse effects on the respiratory system. Diesel exhaust particulate (DEP), which constitutes the major part of PM, is characterized by a carbonic mixture composed of approximately 18,000 different high-molecular-weight organic compounds. Diesel engines release 10 times the amount of NO2 aldehydes and breathable PM compared to unleaded gasoline engines and more than 100 times that produced by catalysed gasoline engines; these data gain great significance when taken into account the fact that diesel-powered vehicles are becoming more and more popular. DEP polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), once deposited on airways mucous surfaces easily pass through epithelial cells (ECs) membranes, bind themselves to cytosolic receptors and then affect cell growth and differentiation. Human lung epithelial cells and macrophages engulf DEP, this resulting in increased proinflammatory cytokines release (IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF). We investigated the biological effects of DEP-PM on the human lung EC line A549. Light microscopy analysis suggested the presence of cell wall alterations, and provided evidence of PM internalization and cytoplasmic vacuolization. Following PM stimulation, nuclei also were seen undergo clear gross morphological modifications. Immunocytochemistry was used to detect intracytoplasmic IL-6 and IL-8 expression. © 2006.},

   abstract = {The models HARM and ELMO are used to investigate the importance of different source categories contributing to total PM10 (SIA, SOA and primary particulate matter) across the UK and the impact of uncertainties on both present day and future concentration estimates. Modelled concentrations of SIA (secondary inorganic aerosol) are compared against data from the UK's Nitric Acid and Aerosol Network and SOA (secondary organic aerosol) against measurements made at the Bush Estate, Edinburgh. These data indicate that the HARM/ELMO modelling approach comes close to achieving mass closure. Comparison with national maps of total PM10 indicate that the models underestimate particulate matter concentrations around large conurbations, probably due to the localised nature of emissions of primary particulates in these areas and model scale. The models are used to attribute particulate matter to different source and size categories, assessing the relative importance of primaries, SIA and SOA; the contributions of anthropogenic and biogenic precursors of SOA; the relative importance of PMcoarse (PM10-PM2.5) and PMfine (PM2.5) and UK vs. other EMEP area sources. The implications of these attributions for emissions control policies are discussed. The impact of uncertainties in emissions of the sources of primaries, SIA and SOA are explored. For primary PM10 and SOA this has been achieved through emissions scaling and for SIA using the GLUE (Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation) approach. The selection of acceptable model parameter sets has been based on the need to retain the capability to model deposition of S and N species. The impact of uncertainty on estimates of present day SIA concentrations is illustrated for sites in the Nitric Acid and Aerosol Network. A more limited assessment for 2010 has been carried out at the national scale, illustrating that inclusion of uncertainty can change modelled concentrations from no exceedance of current air quality objectives, to one of exceedance over large areas of south and east England. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Two and a half years (June 2002 to September 2004) of air pollution and meteorological parameters in a street canyon in Stockholm were analyzed. A distinctive dependence of particle number concentration, normalized by NOx, with ambient temperature was found. By comparison with NOx, it is concluded that this variation is not related to variability in the emissions nor due to changes in atmospheric dilution. The observed ratio between total particle number and NOx increases from ca. [150 ± 60] particles per picogram of NOx [pgNOx- 1] at + 15 \{ring operator\} C to [380 ± 50] [pgNOx- 1] at - 15 \{ring operator\} C. The increase in particle number concentration with decreasing temperatures is different for different particle sizes. For particle sizes smaller than 40 nm the variation is more pronounced while for particle sizes larger than 100 nm the change is not statistically significant. This reflects the impact of temperature dependent processes that affect mainly particles smaller than 100 nm in diameter. Modeling results indicate that condensation of volatile compounds onto pre-existing aerosols gives similar changes in the particle size distribution as those observed. Coagulation is shown to have only minor effects on the particle size distribution. Even though, with the present data set is not possible to quantify the impact of an increased nucleation rate with low temperatures, it was shown that nucleation mode particles are largely influenced by relative humidity with high concentrations during high relative humidity periods and therefore it is expected that for cold periods, when the relative humidity is higher, nucleation is enhanced by the water content of the air. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Multiple 24-h average outdoor, indoor and personal respirable particulate matter (RPM) measurements were made in different urban residential colonies to determine major routes of personal exposure. The study area was Bhilai-Durg, District Durg, Chhattisgarh, India. About 100 residentials from each of two selected colonies have been surveyed for consent to participate in the study and for preparation of time-activity diary. On the basis of their time-activity diary, residentials have been categorized into three types: type-A, purely residential; type-B, residents who go out, and type-C, residence who go into work, specially in industrial area. A total of 28 adult participants (14 males and 14 females; mean age 40±15, range 21-61 years) were selected and monitored longitudinally during the summer (15 March-15 June) of 2004. Participants' residential indoor RPM level and also local ambient outdoor RPM levels were measured,and these are done simultaneous with personal monitoring. Residential indoor and ambient outdoors RPM monitoring sessions were throughout the year to obtain infiltration factor more precisely. To compare RPM levels with Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of PM10, simultaneous measurements of PM10 were also done with the course of ambient outdoor RPM monitoring. RPM levels in indoors were higher compared to ambient outdoors. The annual average ratio RPM/PM10 was found to vary significantly among residential sites due to variation in surroundings. Source contribution estimates (SCE) of personal exposure to RPM in selected 12 residences (six from each colony) have been investigated using chemical mass balance model CMB8. Ambient outdoors, residential indoors, soils and road-traffic borne RPM were identified as main routes and principal sources of personal RPM. Results of model output have shown that residential indoors and soil-borne RPM are the major routes of personal exposure. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We developed regression equations to predict fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at air monitoring locations in the New York City region using data on nearby traffic and land use patterns. Three-year averages (1999-2001) of PM2.5 at US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitors in the 28 counties including and surrounding New York City were calculated using daily data from the EPA's Air Quality Subsystem. As the secondary contribution to PM2.5 concentrations is lowest in the winter, we also calculated and modeled average winter 2000 PM2.5 to conduct a preliminary evaluation of model sensitivity to source contribution. Candidate predictor variables included traffic, land use, census and emissions data from local, state and national sources and were tabulated for a series of circular buffer regions at varying distances around the monitors using a geographic information system. In total, more than 25 variables at 5 different buffer distances were considered for inclusion in the model. Before evaluating the variables we removed several samples from the modeling for validation. For comparison and validation purposes we computed both a model using data for the full 28-county region as well as a more urbanized 9-county region. We found that traffic within a buffer of 300 or 500 m explains the greatest proportion of variance (37-44%) in all 3 models. Measures of urbanization, specifically population density, explain a significant amount of the residual variation (7-18%) after including a traffic variable. Finally, a measure of industrial land use further improves the 28-county and 9-county models based on the 3-yr annual averages, explaining an additional 4% and 11% of the variation, respectively, while vegetative land use improves the winter model explaining an additional 6%. The final models predicted well at validation locations. In total, the final land use regression models explain between 61% and 64% of the variation in PM2.5. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Al speciation study is essential to better evaluate the mobility, availability, and persistence of trace Al and Al species in the atmosphere. This paper reports Al distribution and speciation in atmospheric particles with aerodynamic diameters >10.0, 10.0-2.5 and <2.5 μm in the urban area of Nanjing, China. Urban particles were collected with a high-volume sampling system equipped with a cascade impactor, which effectively separates the particulate matter into three size ranges. Particulate Al was fractionated into five different forms (insoluble, oxide, organic, carbonate, and exchangeable species) by the modified five-step Tessier's sequential extraction procedure. The main points are as follows: (1) The average levels of Al in PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PM>10 are 2.02±0.35, 3.04±0.43 and 6.32±0.76 μg m-3, respectively, with PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PM>10 constituting respectively, 17.8±3.1%, 26.7±3.8% and 55.5±6.7% of suspended particulate matter (SPM) mass (11.38 μg m-3). (2) The vertical profile of airborne Al in the above three size fractions has been estimated. A significant increase in airborne Al concentrations was found for PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PM>10 as the sampling height above the ground increased from 2.5 to 17.5 m; however, there was an obvious decrease in airborne Al concentrations between 17.5 and 40.0 m. The maximum mean of total Al in PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PM>10 occurred between 12.5 and 20.0 m above the ground. (3) The distribution of Al speciation was studied. It was found that the size distribution of airborne Al species followed the order: insoluble species>oxide species>organic species>carbonate species>exchangeable species. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The forecast system automatically downloads the required input data twice each day, produces next-day forecasts of metro area peak 8-h average ozone concentration using a computer coded hybrid nonlinear regression (NLR) model, and posts the results on a website. The automated models were similar to previous NLR models, first applied to forecasting ozone in the Louisville metro area. The forecast system operated reliably during the 2004 and 2005 O3 seasons, producing at least one forecast per day better than 99% of the time. The forecast accuracy of the automated system was good. For all 2004 and 2005 forecasts, the mean absolute error was equal to 8.7 ppb, or 15.6% of the overall mean concentration. The overall detection rate of air quality standard exceedences was 56%, and the overall false alarm rate was 42%. In Louisville, the performance of the automated system was comparable to that of expert forecasters using the NLR model as a forecast tool. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The project determined the percentages of protein-based ambient bioaerosols for particles in the 2.5-10 μm range and for particles in the range of 2.5 μm or less in 298 samples taken over a six-month period. The analysis of total protein mass was used as an all-inclusive indicator of biologically based aerosols. These organic bioaerosols may have nucleated with inorganic non-biological aerosols, or they may be combined with inert aerosols. The source of these bioaerosols may be any combination of pollen, mold, bacteria, insect debris, fecal matter, or dander, and they may induce irritational, allergic, infectious, and chemical responses in exposed individuals. Ambient samples of PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 were analyzed for gravimetric mass and total protein mass. The results for 19 of 24 sample periods indicated that between 1% and 4% of PM10-2.5 and between 1% and 2% of PM2.5 mass concentrations were made of ambient protein bioaerosols.

A series of combustion experiments were performed to investigate the emission characteristics of particles in the size range of submicron by means of drop-tube furnace with three major domestic heavy oils. Cascade impactors were utilized to determine the size distribution of particulates as well as to analyze the partitioning enrichment of vanadium and nickel in various size ranges. Experimental results were compared with field data of particle size distribution and metal partitioning at commercial utility boilers with heavy oil combustion. Such data were interpreted by chemical equilibrium and particle growth mechanism by means of computational models. In general, fine particles were the major portion of PM10 emitted from the heavy oil combustion, with significant fraction of ultra-fine particles. The formation of ultra-fine particles through nucleation/condensation/coagulation from heavy oil combustion was confirmed by field and experimental data. Vanadium and nickel were more enriched in fine particles, particularly in ultra-fine particles. The conventional air pollution devices showed inefficient capability to remove ultra-fine particles enriched with hazardous transition metal elements such as vanadium and nickel. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The model using different land cover data sets preformed similarly in modeling meteorological field patterns, vertical profiles and surface wind and temperature, in comparisons against observations. The differences of wind and temperature at a specific time and location can be big. Compared against satellite and ground measurements, modeled dust spatial distributions using MODIS land cover data were considerably better than those using OWE land cover. Site against site comparisons of modeled and observed surface PM2.5 concentration time series showed that model performance improved significantly using MODIS land cover data. Modeled surface PM2.5 contour distributions using MODIS land cover data compared more favorably against observations. The performance statistics for modeled PM2.5 concentrations at 40 surface sites increased from 0.15 using OWE data, to 0.58 using MODIS data. This demonstrates that the survey updates and spatial resolution of land cover data are critical in correctly predicting dust events and dust concentrations. Using land cover data such as MODIS data from satellite remote sensing is promising in improving wind-blown dust modeling and forecasting. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The annual mean PM10 and PM2.5 levels were 36.4 ± 27.8 and 9.7 ± 5.9 μ g m- 3, respectively. PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations indicated orders of magnitude change from day to day (PM10 = 2 - 326 μ g m- 3; PM2.5 = 0.5 - 28 μ g m- 3). The highest levels of PM10 were observed during the transition period (March, April and May) due to mineral dust transported from North Africa and during winter due to sea spray generation. However, PM2.5 levels exhibited higher concentrations during summer resulting from an enhanced production of secondary aerosols. The PM2.5 / PM10 ratio (0.25) and categorization of air mass back trajectories indicated that PM10 at the study area is dominated by primary aerosol emissions (mineral dust particles from the Saharan Desert and sea salt particles from the Mediterranean Sea itself). During the whole sampling period 28 and 51 events exceeded the recommended maximum values of 50 and 15 μ g m- 3 for PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. Source apportionment analysis indicated that PM10 exceedances originated as a consequence of natural events (mineral dust ∼ 40 %; sea salt ∼ 50 %) whereas PM2.5 exceedances were accounted primarily by pollution events (in 90% of the cases). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The atmospheric impact of a number of loading/unloading activities of diverse raw materials has been assessed from continuous measurements of ambient particle concentrations recorded close to the emission sources. Two experimental campaigns have been carried out in the Tarragona port to document the impact of specific handling operations and bulk materials. Dusty bulk materials such as silica-manganese powder, tapioca, coal, clinker and lucerne were dealt with during the experiments. The highest impacts on ambient particle concentrations were recorded during handling of clinker. For this material and silica-manganese powder, high concentrations were recorded in the fine grain size (<2.5 μm). The lowest impacts on particulate matter concentrations were recorded during handling of tapioca and lucerne, mainly in the coarse grain size (2-5-10 μm). The effectiveness of several emission abatement measures, such as ground watering to diminish coal particle resuspension, was demonstrated to reduce ambient concentrations by up to two orders of magnitude. The importance of other good practices in specific handling operations, such as controlling the height of the shovel discharge, was also evidenced by these experiments. The results obtained can be further utilized as a useful experimental database for emission factor estimations. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We collected ambient fungi in the last week of every month during the study period, using duplicate Burkard portable samplers and Malt Extract Agar. The median concentration of total fungi was 1339 colony-forming units m-3 of air over the study period. The most prevalent fungi were non-sporulating fungi, Cladosporium, Penicillium, Curvularia and Aspergillus at both sites. Airborne fungal concentrations and diversity of fungal species were generally higher in urban than in rural areas. Most fungal taxa had significant seasonal variations, with higher levels in summer. Multivariate analyses showed that the levels of ambient fungi were associated positively with temperature, but negatively with ozone and several other air pollutants. Relative humidity also had a significant non-linear relationship with ambient fungal levels. We concluded that the concentrations and the compositions of ambient fungi are diverse in urban and rural areas in the subtropical region. High ambient fungal levels were related to an urban environment and environmental conditions of high temperature and low ozone levels. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {In this article, numerical simulations and observational analyses have been made for the aerosol episode that occurred over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in China during 1-3 November 2003. An air quality modeling system that consisted of the mesoscale model MM5, chemical transport model MODELS-3/CMAQ, and air pollutant emission model SMOKE, was employed. Studies have shown that this particulate matter (PM) pollution episode was apparently associated with the activity of tropical cyclone (TC) Melor. Model simulations revealed that Melor spawned this PM episode through dynamic and thermodynamic processes. The strong compensating subsidence induced by Melor's peripheral circulations created favorable meteorological conditions that enhanced local aerosol pollution. This strong downward motion produced significant adiabatic warming (2-4 °C daily) and dramatic drying in the low-level troposphere over the PRD. As a result, the PRD region was blanketed with a dry and warm air layer that strengthened the static stability of the lower troposphere. The descending motion also tended to dramatically lower the heights of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) through its dynamic effect. The fair weather created by this synoptic pattern further intensified the nocturnal temperature inversions through enhanced radiative cooling. All of these factors promoted a stagnant local atmosphere with very light winds near the surface. The horizontal and vertical dispersions of locally emitted aerosol particles were largely suppressed, leading to the accumulation of large amounts of PMs near local emission sources in the PRD region. As Melor drew near, changes in surface winds strengthened the horizontal transport of aerosol particles from inland sources to the area of Hong Kong downstream. This horizontal advection greatly contributed to the high PM10 (particulate matters less than 10 μm in diameters) concentrations in Hong Kong. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The necessity of finding out a balance between the costs of achieving a lower level of environmental and health injury and the benefits of providing electricity at a reasonable cost have lead to the process of estimating the external costs derived from these impacts and not included in the electricity prices as a quantitative measure of it that, even when there are large uncertainties involved, can be used by decision makers in the process of achieving a global sustainable development. The external costs of the electricity generation in three Cuban power plants that use fossil fuel oils with high sulfur content have been assessed.

Dispersion of atmospheric pollutants is modeled at local and regional scales in a detailed way. Health impacts include mortality and those morbidity effects that showed relation with the increment of selected pollutant concentration in national studies.

This study was designed to assess the impact of the ionic composition of particulate matter on asthmatic respiratory functions in São Paulo city. From May to July 2002, fine and coarse particulate matter fractions were collected and their respective chemical composition with respect to major ions (Na+, Mg2+, K+, Ca2+, NH4+, Cl-, NO3- and SO42-) were determined in each aqueous-extract fraction. The results showed predominant concentrations of SO42- (48.4%), NO3- (19.6%) and NH4+ (12.5%) in the fine fraction, whereas NO3- (35.3%), SO42- (29.1%), Ca2+ (13.1%) and Cl- (12.5%) were the predominant species in the coarse fraction. The association between the chemical components of both fractions and the daily peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements (morning and evening) of the 33 asthmatic individuals were assessed through a linear mixed-effects model. The results showed a significant negative correlation (decrease of PEF) between morning PEF and coarse chloride (3-day moving average) and between evening PEF and coarse Na+ (3-day moving average), coarse Mg2+ (3-day moving average) and coarse NH4+ (2- and 3-day moving average). A significant negative correlation has also been observed between morning and evening PEF and Mg2+ in the fine fraction. These results suggest that some particle chemical constituents may increase the responsiveness of airways and that coarse particles that deposit in the upper airways may be more relevant for asthmatic response and irritation. However, the results do not prove a clear causal relationship. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {In order to carry out efficient traffic and air quality management, validated models and PM emission estimates are needed. This paper compares current available emission factor estimates for PM10 and PM2.5 from emission databases and different emission models, and validates these against eight high quality street pollution measurements in Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Finland and Austria. The data sets show large variation of the PM concentration and emission factors with season and with location. Consistently at all roads the PM10 and PM2.5 emission factors are lower in the summer month than the rest of the year. For example, PM10 emission factors are in average 5-45% lower during the month 6-10 compared to the annual average. The range of observed total emission factors (including non-exhaust emissions) for the different sites during summer conditions are 80-130 mg km-1 for PM10, 30-60 mg km-1 for PM2.5 and 20-50 mg km-1 for the exhaust emissions. We present two different strategies regarding modelling of PM emissions: (1) For Nordic conditions with strong seasonal variations due to studded tyres and the use of sand/salt as anti-skid treatment a time varying emission model is needed. An empirical model accounting for these Nordic conditions was previously developed in Sweden. (2) For other roads with a less pronounced seasonal variation (e.g. in Denmark, Germany, Austria) methods using a constant emission factor maybe appropriate. Two models are presented here. Further, we apply the different emission models to data sets outside the original countries. For example, we apply the "Swedish" model for two streets without studded tyre usage and the "German" model for Nordic data sets. The "Swedish" empirical model performs best for streets with studded tyre use, but was not able to improve the correlation versus measurements in comparison to using constant emission factors for the Danish side. The "German" method performed well for the streets without clear seasonal variation and reproduces the summer conditions for streets with pronounced seasonal variation. However, the seasonal variation of PM emission factors can be important even for countries not using studded tyres, e.g. in areas with cold weather and snow events using sand and de-icing materials. Here a constant emission factor probably will under-estimate the 90-percentiles and therefore a time varying emission model need to be used or developed for such areas. All emission factor models consistently indicate that a large part (about 50-85% depending on the location) of the total PM10 emissions originates from non-exhaust emissions. This implies that reduction measures for the exhaust part of the vehicle emissions will only have a limited effect on ambient PM10 levels. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The main aims of the proposed model are the identification of the sources of variability characterising the PM10 process and the estimation of pollution levels at unmonitored spatial locations. We adopt a fully Bayesian approach, using Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithms. We apply the model on PM10 data measured at 11 monitoring sites located in the major towns and cities of Italy's Emilia-Romagna Region. The model is designed for areas with PM10 measurements available; the case of PM10 level estimation from emissions data is not handled. The model has been carefully checked using Bayesian p-values and graphical posterior predictive checks. Results show that the temporal random effect is the most important when explaining PM10 levels. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The use of fireworks creates an unusual and distinctive anthropogenic atmospheric pollution event. We report on aerosol samples collected during Las Fallas in Valencia, a 6-day celebration famous for its firework displays, and add comparative data on firework- and bonfire-contaminated atmospheric aerosol samples collected from elsewhere in Spain (Barcelona, L'Alcora, and Borriana) and during the Guy Fawkes celebrations in London. Specific high-profile official firework events during Las Fallas included the afternoon Mascletà and the nightly aerial displays (especially in the climactic final 2 days of the fiesta) and were accompanied by pollution spikes in suspended particles, NO, SO2, and the creation and dispersal of an aerosol cloud enriched in a range of metallic elements. Notable metal aerosol concentration increases recorded during Las Fallas were potassium (from 500 to 5900 ng m-3), aluminium (as Al2O3 from around 600 to 2200 ng m-3), titanium (from 200 to 700 ng m-3), magnesium (from 100 to 500 ng m-3), lead (from 17 to 379 ng m-3), barium (from 39 to 322 ng m-3), strontium (from 3 to 112 ng m-3), copper (from 12 to 71 ng m-3), and antimony (from 1 to 52 ng m-3). Firework-contaminated aerosols of similarly metalliferous composition were also identified at the other monitoring sites, although different sites show variations attributable to other sources such as bonfires and local industry. Unusual levels of the trace elements Ba, Sr and (to a lesser extent) Cu, always in proportions with Ba dominant, along with strongly enhanced K, Pb, and Sb, are identified as being particularly characteristic of firework aerosols. Although firework-related recreational pollution episodes are transient in nature, they are highly concentrated, contribute significantly to total annual metal emissions, and are on average fine enough to be easily inhaled and a health risk to susceptible individuals. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Communication of the complex relationship between air pollutant exposure and ill health is essential to an air pollution information system. We propose a novel air pollution index (API) system based on the relative risk of the well-established increased daily mortality associated with short-term exposure to common air pollutants: particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5), sulphur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. To construct our index system, the total incremental daily mortality risk of exposure to these pollutants was associated with an index value ranging from 0 to 10. The index scale is linear with respect to incremental risk. The index is open ended, although, for convenience, an index of 10 is assigned for exposures yielding indices ≥10. To illustrate the application of this API system, a set of published relative risk factors are used to calculate sub-index values for each pollutant, in the range of air pollutant concentrations commonly experienced in urban areas. To account for the reality of ubiquitous simultaneous exposure to a mixture of the common air pollutants, the final API is the sum of the normalised values of the individual indices for PM10, PM2.5, sulphur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. This establishes a self-consistent index system where a given index value corresponds to the same daily mortality risk associated with the combined exposure to the common air pollutants. To facilitate health-risk communication, index values are colour coded and associated with broad health-risk descriptors. The utility of the proposed API is illustrated by applying it to monitored ambient concentration data for the City of Cape Town, South Africa. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {A portable radiance research nephelometer was used to measure the variation in woodsmoke pollution in Armidale (a small town of 22,000 people), New South Wales, Australia, on 14 winter nights in 1996. Winter nights are characterised by inversions that trap the air within the valley and reduce winds to very low speeds (averaging 0.15 m s-1). Pollution varied considerably with location. Mean scattering coefficients (bsp/10 km) for 14 measurement nights ranged from less than 1.0 on the undeveloped fringes of the city to 8.7, the latter representing a 14-night average of 200 μg m-3 of PM2.5. Pollution was generally highest in the residential areas on either side of the valley, where the smoke was generated, rather than the low-lying central creeklands. In places, average pollution levels increased 4-fold within 41 m. The correlation between nephelometer and gravimetric pollution measurements ranged 0.95-0.99. The presence of large, sudden but repeatable changes in air pollution, and high correlations between nephelometer and gravimetric measurements, indicate that mobile pollution monitoring devices provide a useful and accurate estimate of spatial variability. Estimated exposure for the town as a whole was 1.02 for the 6 months from April to September, 0.25 in October as heater use declines, and 0.12 in normal summer months. For comparison, published 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of the distribution of nephelometer coefficients in Sydney were 0.15, 0.24 and 0.37, respectively. Thus annual exposure to PM2.5 pollution in Armidale from woodsmoke is more than double that from all sources in Sydney, a city of 4 million. Overseas estimates of 6% increased mortality for each additional 10 μg m-3 of PM2.5 suggest that wood heaters in Armidale may increase mortality in Armidale by about 7%, with estimated cost of about $4270 per woodheater per year. Alternative cheap and environmentally friendly methods of keeping houses warm in winter, such as solar heating, should therefore be developed. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Current standards for fine particulates and nitrogen dioxide are under revision. Patients with cardiovascular disease have been identified as the largest group which need to be protected from effects of urban air pollution. Methods: We sought to estimate associations between indicators of urban air pollution and daily mortality using time series of daily TSP, PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, O3 and nontrauma deaths in Vienna (Austria) 2000-2004. We used polynomial distributed lag analysis adjusted for seasonality, daily temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and incidence of influenza as registered by sentinels. Results: All three particulate measures and NO2 were associated with mortality from all causes and from ischemic heart disease and COPD at all ages and in the elderly. The magnitude of the effect was largest for PM2.5 and NO2. Best predictor of mortality increase lagged 0-7 days was PM2.5 (for ischemic heart disease and COPD) and NO2 (for other heart disease and all causes). Total mortality increase, lagged 0-14 days, per 10 μg m-3 was 2.6% for PM2.5 and 2.9% for NO2, mainly due to cardiopulmonary and cerebrovascular causes. Conclusion: Acute and subacute lethal effects of urban air pollution are predicted by PM2.5 and NO2 increase even at relatively low levels of these pollutants. This is consistent with results on hospital admissions and the lack of a threshold. While harvesting (reduction of mortality after short increase due to premature deaths of most sensitive persons) seems to be of minor importance, deaths accumulate during 14 days after an increase of air pollutants. The limit values for PM2.5 and NO2 proposed for 2010 in the European Union are unable to prevent serious health effects. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Dust events are common air pollution events in parts of the world with arid, semi-arid, or desert areas. There is little research on the association between respiratory and cardiovascular health and dust events in places which are close to the deserts. The aim of this study is to evaluate the health effects of dust events in a location where traffic and industry are underdeveloped and dust events are most frequent in China. The setting allows the opportunity to reduce confounding by anthropogenically derived particulate matter and to confirm the health effects of dust events. The present study was done using daily counts of hospitalizations in Minqin (1994-2003) for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth revision) for males and females. Using a semi-parametric generalized additive model and controlling for long-term temporal trends, day of the week, meteorological factors, and seasonal influence, counts of hospitalization were analyzed for dust events in a Poisson regression. Relative risks (RRs) were used to estimate the risk of dust events for respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations. In the year-round model, dust events with a lag of 3 days were significantly associated with total respiratory hospitalization for males and females, with RRs of 1.14 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.29) and 1.18 (95% CI 1.00-1.41); dust events with a lag of 4 days were significantly associated with upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in males (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.04-1.59), and dust events with a lag of 6 days were significantly associated with pneumonia in males, with an RR of 1.17 (95% CI 1.00-1.38). A significant association between dust events with a lag of 3 days and hypertension in males was also found (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.03,1.64). In the seasonal analysis model, the associations between the dust events and respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations were stronger in spring and in winter, respectively. The results show the health effects of dust events on respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations, and the characteristic seasonal distribution of the health effects. In addition, the health effects of dust events are consistent with recent animal and human data showing the respiratory and cardiovascular effects of particulate matter. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the exact physiochemical nature of the responsible component is not clear. Secondary airborne PM formed from gas-phase pollutants contributes significantly to the most severe particulate air quality events. Although chemical formation for ionic species of aerosol have been observed, they have not been well reported for local variation. This work evaluates the amount of secondary particulate ionic species: sulfates (SO42 -) and nitrates (NO3-), chlorides (Cl-) and the mutagenic activities of PM10 extracts in different Italian sites (one Southern, one Central and three Northern; in one of the latter also PM2.5 has been evaluated). In general, mean secondary species concentration constitutes about 35-45% of PM10 mass in the North sites, 15% in the center site and 20% in the South site and it is positively associated with PM10 levels. There are significant local differences in the mean levels of PM10 ionic constituents: NO3- are predominant in northern cities, SO42 - are more equally distributed and coastal southern city is abundant in Cl-. Samples were also tested for mutagenicity with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100, with and without metabolic activation; mutagenicity did not correlate with PM10 concentrations. The results showed the important roles and the geographical variability of PM secondary species in the total mass PM10 concentrations and the usefulness of this biological approach for monitoring PM to understand hazards from PM. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {We review the scientific basis for default assessment factors used in risk assessment of nongenotoxic chemicals including the use of chemical- and pathways specific assessment factors, and extrapolation approaches relevant to species differences, age and gender. One main conclusion is that the conventionally used default factor of 100 does not cover all inter-species and inter-individual differences. We suggest that a species-specific default factor based on allometric scaling should be used for inter-species extrapolation (basal metabolic rate). Regarding toxicodynamic and remaining toxicokinetic differences we suggest that a percentile from a probabilistic distribution is chosen to derive the assessment factor. Based on the scarce information concerning the human-to-human variability it is more difficult to suggest a specific assessment factor. However, extra emphasis should be put on sensitive populations such as neonates and genetically sensitive subgroups, and also fetuses and children which may be particularly vulnerable during development and maturation. Factors that also need to be allowed for are possible gender differences in sensitivity, deficiencies in the databases, nature of the effect, duration of exposure, and route-to-route extrapolation. Since assessment factors are used to compensate for lack of knowledge we feel that it is prudent to adopt a "conservative" approach, erring on the side of protectiveness. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Although a dose-effect relationship between water fluoride levels and damage to liver and kidney functions in animals has been reported, it was not demonstrated in humans. To evaluate the effects of drinking water fluoride levels on the liver and kidney functions in children with and without dental fluorosis, we identified 210 children who were divided into seven groups with 30 each based on different drinking water fluoride levels in the same residential area. We found that the fluoride levels in serum and urine of these children increased as the levels of drinking water fluoride increased. There were no significant differences in the levels of total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), aspartate transamine (AST), and alanine transamine (ALT) in serum among these groups. However, the activities of serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), urine N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase (NAG), and urine γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT) in children with dental fluorosis and having water fluoride of 2.15-2.96 mg/L and in children having water fluoride of 3.15-5.69 mg/L regardless of dental fluorosis were significantly higher than children exposed to water fluoride of 0.61-0.87 mg/L in a dose-response manner. In contrast to children with dental fluorosis and having water fluoride of 2.15-2.96 and 3.10-5.69 mg/L, serum LDH activity of children without dental fluorosis but exposed to the same levels of water fluoride as those with dental fluorosis were also markedly lower, but the activities of NAG and γ-GT in their urine were not. Therefore, our results suggest that drinking water fluoride levels over 2.0 mg/L can cause damage to liver and kidney functions in children and that the dental fluorosis was independent of damage to the liver but not the kidney. Further studies on the mechanisms and significance underlying damage to the liver without dental fluorosis in the exposed children are warranted. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We hypothesized that aggregates of ultrafine carbon and washed diesel particles impair the ability of alveolar macrophages (AM) to kill bacteria and enhance the AM lipid peroxidation (LPO) of lung surfactant. Rat AM were exposed, 5 h, to particles 20 μg/ml. The AM, containing carbon or washed diesel particles, were incubated 2 h, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, an American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strain or clinical isolates. Surviving bacteria were quantified. Surfactant was incubated, 5 h, with carbon or washed diesel loaded AM and LPO was measured. The particle load was approximately 1 μg/106 AM, representing accepted exposure to ambient particles in Europe. Metal concentrations were 10 to 100 fold higher in washed diesel-than in carbon particles. There was a dose dependent increase in bacterial survival with carbon-loaded macrophages, but not with washed diesel-loaded AM. Clinical isolates had a higher survival rate with carbon-loaded macrophages than the ATCC strain. Surfactant LPO was increased with washed diesel-loaded macrophages (95%) and with carbon-loaded macrophages (55%) compared to controls. High LPO caused by washed diesel-loaded AM reflects their increased oxidative metabolism, probably caused by particle metals. The additional oxygen metabolites maintained bactericidal activity of AM, while corresponding activity was decreased in carbon-loaded AM. Altered functions of AM may explain health problems related to air pollution. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {In humans, immune development begins early in embryonic life and continues throughout the early postnatal period. Although a number of pesticides have been observed to induce developmental immunotoxicity in mice, few human studies have examined the long term effects of in utero pesticide exposure on childhood morbidity. Empirical evidence suggests that the vulnerable period for toxic insults to the developing immune system extends from early gestation to adolescence in humans and animals. Using data from the Ontario Farm Family Health Study, we examined the relationship between farm couple exposures to pesticides during pregnancy and subsequent health outcomes in their offspring, including: persistent cough or bronchitis, asthma, and allergies or hayfever. No strong associations between pesticide exposures during pregnancy and persistent cough or bronchitis, or asthma were found. There was suggestive evidence that allergies and hayfever appeared to be more common in offspring, especially male offspring, exposed to certain specific pesticides during the period of pregnancy. Nevertheless, given the indirect indicators of pesticide exposure used in this study, and the scarcity of human studies on in utero exposure to pesticides and the development of allergies and other child health outcomes, these findings serve primarlily to generate hypotheses for future research. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {As part of an assessment of schoolchildren's environmental exposures and health, a probability sample of 136 children from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds was drawn from grades 2-5 of two inner-urban Minneapolis schools (Whittier, Lyndale). Questionnaires were administered to a parent/guardian; blood samples for IgE and lung function tests were obtained. Overall adjusted rates for lifetime asthma (15.4%; 95%CI 9.3-21.5%), asthma in the last 12 months (13.6%; 7.8-19.4%), and current asthma medication use (10.5%; 5.3-15.7%) were higher than reported US national rates. Adjusted rates for lifetime physician-diagnosed asthma differed significantly among racial/ethnic groups (P<0.01): African-Americans (25.9%), White/Others (25.8%), Hispanics (9.3%), Somalis (1.8%), Asians (0%). Corresponding rates for atopy (total IgE>100 IU/mL or an allergen-specific IgE>0.35 IU/mL) were: African-Americans (66.6%), White/Others (100%), Hispanics (77.2%), Somalis (78.1%), Asians (81.8%). Lung function (FEV1, FVC) was analyzed by linear regression using log-transformed data: significant race-specific differences in lung function were found relative to White/Others (P<0.001 for each racial/ethnic group): African-Americans (FEV1 -16.5%, FVC -16.9%), Somalis (-22.7%, -26.8%), Hispanics (-12.2%, -11.4%) and Asians (-11.1%, -12.4%). Females had significantly lower FEV1 (-8.8%) and FVC (-11.0%) than males. An unexplained, significant difference in children's lung function was found between the two schools. A history of physician-diagnosed asthma was not associated with decreased lung function. Factors other than poverty, inner-urban living, and IgE levels (atopy) need to be considered in the development of childhood asthma. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The current study used a population-based time-series analysis design to evaluate the effects of daily and weekly PM10 and PM2.5 on respiratory health outcomes among children <20 years of age residing in Anchorage enrolled in Medicaid. All generated estimating equations models were adjusted for season, year, weekends, temperature, wind speed, and precipitation. Relative to the days with PM10 mass concentration ≤13 μg/m3, a significant 9.3% increase (RR: 1.093, 95% CI: 1.004-1.191) in the rate of outpatient visits for asthma occurred during days with PM10 of 20-33 μg/m3. No further dose-response occurred for days with PM10 ≥34 μg/m3. A significant 18.1% increase (RR: 1.181, 95% CI: 1.010-1.381) in the rate of quick-relief medication prescriptions occurred during days with PM10 of 34-60 μg/m3, and a 28.8% increase (RR: 1.288, 95% CI: 1.026-1.619) occurred during days with PM10≥61 μg/m3. Similar results for outpatient asthma visits and quick-relief medication occurred in weekly models. There were no significant associations with PM2.5 in either daily or weekly models. These subtle but statistically significant associations suggest that non-industrial, geologic sources of PM10 may have measurable health effects at levels below current national standards. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Owing to the large number of natural and anthropogenic sources, particulate matter (PM) may present several physical and chemical patterns in different areas. The finer PM2.5 fraction, which is now widely but not routinely measured in Europe, is considered to be the alveolar fraction of the ambient particles. Annual and winter mean concentrations of PM2.5 substantially vary in Europe, with higher concentrations in the South. The aims of this work were to (a) measure the PM2.5 levels in Turin over a long period, (b) evaluate mutagenic activities of organic extracts containing this collected complex mixture using the Ames test and (c) determine the level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in order to identify important mutagens in ambient air. Sampling was carried out from November 2001 to December 2004. The monthly mean of PM2.5 was 48.76±24.12 μg/m3. From the beginning to the end of the sample period there was a decrease in gravimetric levels, with annual means of 54.10±29.77 μg/m3 in 2002; 42.48±15.73 μg/m3 in 2003 and 45.89±24.92 μg/m3 in 2004. Samples were tested for mutagenicity using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100, with and without S9 mix metabolic activation. A positive genotoxic response was observed for TA98, with and without metabolic activation. The measured PAHs monthly mean level was 8.24±6.30 ng/m3, with values ranging from 0.20 to 21.38 ng/m3. Seasonal variation of gravimetric, mutagenic and PAH values was significant. The Salmonella assay results statistically correlated to PM2.5 and PAHs levels, but sometimes the mutagenic potencies were rather different despite an equal concentration of pollutant. The results confirm the usefulness of this biological approach to detect genotoxic properties of sampled PM2.5 and they show the variability of the mutagenic properties of the airborne mixture over time. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

However, these relationships have rarely been studied in São Paulo, Brazil. Methods: From 1996 to 2000, biometeorological indices including meteorological variables such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind were used to measure thermal comfort in elderly people mortality (>65 years old), and CVD was quantified. Results: Statistical analysis showed a significant negative loading between CVD and meteorological variables as well as thermal comfort indices. The CVD curve was a U-shaped, showing higher value for cold stress than for heat stress. The results clearly show seasonal variations in CVD mortality rates, which were higher in winter. Meteorological variables were found to play an important role as well as through the thermal comfort indices. The air pollutants, PM10 and SO2, except ozone, presented positive loadings with CVD, albeit less than statistically significant. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Its association with adverse health effects and the still unclear mechanisms of action are of concern worldwide. Our objective was to analyze air PM from downtown Buenos Aires (UAP-BA), and evaluate its biological impact on normal airways. We studied the inflammatory response to intranasal instillation of UAP-BA in a short-term-exposure mouse model. We analyzed UAP-BA morphology by scanning electron microscopy and characterized particle chemical composition by energy dispersive X-ray analysis and capillary gas chromatography. We evaluated lung changes by histomorphometry and histochemical methods. Regarding size, surface area and distribution, UAP-BA proved to be small spherical ultrafine particles: free, in clusters and associated to a matrix. The particles contained polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls and almost no metal traces. Histologically, UAP-BA induced the recruitment of phagocytes, a reduction in air spaces, an increase in mucous PAS positive cells and weak incomplete elastic fiber network. Our results demonstrate that UAP-BA causes adverse biological effects on the respiratory tract generating inflammation that, in turn, may cause tissue injury or organ dysfunction and may contribute to the pathogenesis of lung diseases. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Although the relationship between temperature level and mortality outcomes has been well established, it is still unknown whether within-day variation in temperature, e.g. diurnal temperature range (DTR), is a risk factor for death independent of the corresponding temperature. Moreover, DTR is a meteorological indicator associated with global climate change which may be related to a variety of health outcomes. We hypothesized that large diurnal temperature change might be a source of additional environmental stress and therefore a risk factor for death. We used daily weather and mortality data from Shanghai, China to test this hypothesis. We conducted a time-series study to examine the association between DTR and mortality outcomes from 2001 to 2004. A semi-parametric generalized additive model (GAM) was used to assess the acute effect of DTR on mortality after controlling for covariates including time trend, day of the week (DOW), temperature, humidity, and outdoor air pollution. We found a strong association between DTR and daily mortality after adjustment for those potential confounders. A 1 °C increment of the 3-day moving average of DTR corresponded to a 1.37% (95% CI 1.08-1.65%) increase in total non-accidental mortality, a 1.86% (95% CI 1.40-2.32%) increase in cardiovascular mortality, and a 1.29% (95% CI 0.49-2.09%) increase in respiratory mortality. The effects of DTR on total non-accidental and cardiovascular mortality were significant on both "cold" (below 23 °C) and "warm" (at least 23 °C) days, although respiratory mortality was only significantly associated with DTR on "cold" days. This study suggests within-day variation in temperature may be a novel risk factor for death. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Recent work suggests that air pollution is a risk factor for cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disease. Effects of inhaled pollutants on the production of vasoactive factors such as endothelin (ET) and nitric oxide (NO) in the brain may be relevant to disease pathogenesis. Inhaled pollutants increase circulating levels of ET-1 and ET-3, and the pituitary is a potential source of plasma ET, but the effects of pollutants on the expression of ET and NO synthase genes in the brain and pituitary are not known. In the present study, Fischer-344 rats were exposed by nose-only inhalation to particles (0, 5, 50 mg/m3 EHC-93), ozone (0, 0.4, 0.8 ppm), or combinations of particles and ozone for 4 h. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to measure mRNA levels in the cerebral hemisphere and pituitary 0 and 24 h post-exposure. Ozone inhalation significantly increased preproET-1 but decreased preproET-3 mRNAs in the cerebral hemisphere, while increasing mRNA levels of preproET-1, preproET-3, and the ET-converting enzyme (ECE)-1 in the pituitary. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was initially decreased in the cerebral hemisphere after ozone inhalation, but increased 24 h post-exposure. Particles decreased tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α mRNA in the cerebral hemisphere, and both particles and ozone decreased TNF-α mRNA in the pituitary. Our results show that ozone and particulate matter rapidly modulate the expression of genes involved in key vasoregulatory pathways in the brain and pituitary, substantiating the notion that inhaled pollutants induce cerebrovascular effects.

Recent studies have reported an association between air pollution exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes, but gender differences have not been considered. In order to assess the current evidence of the interactive effects between gender and air pollution on pregnancy outcomes we undertook a systematic literature review. Using a comprehensive list of keywords, English language articles published between 1966 and 2005 were retrieved from major databases. Additional information on gender was obtained from the study authors. Studies were included if they contained well-defined measurements of ambient air pollutants, investigated pregnancy outcomes and reported estimates by gender. In total 11 studies were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the framework in Systematic Reviews in Health Care Meta-analysis in context and Bracken's Guidelines. Of the 11 studies, four evaluated low birth weight (LBW); one each evaluated very low birth weight and fetal growth and six examined preterm birth (PTB). Females were at higher risk of LBW: adjusted odds ratios (AOR) ranged from 1.07 to 1.62. Males were at higher risk for PTB: AORs ranged from 1.11 to 1.20. In addition, there was some evidence to suggest that the effect of air pollution on LBW is differential by gender; however, the evidence was available only from four studies. This is the first systematic review to consider gender effect. Further high quality studies are needed to establish whether these findings prevail. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Using geographical information systems (GIS) tools, the present study analyzed the association between children's lung function development and their long-term exposure to air pollution. The study covered the cohort of 1492 schoolchildren living in the vicinity of a major coal-fired power station in the Hadera sub-district of Israel. In 1996 and 1999, the children underwent subsequent pulmonary function tests (PFT) (forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume during the first second (FEV1)), and the children's parents completed a detailed questionnaire on their health status and household characteristics. A negative association was found between changes in the results of PFT and the estimated individual levels of air pollution. A sensitivity test revealed a FEV1 decline from -4.3% for the average pollution level to -10.2% for the high air pollution level. The results of a sensitivity test for FVC were found to be similar. Association with the reported health status was found to be insignificant. As we conclude, air pollution from a coal-fired power station, although not exceeding local pollution standards, had a negative effect on children's lung function development. As argued, previous studies carried out in the region failed to show the above association because they were based on zone approaches that assign average concentration levels of air pollutants to all individuals in each zone, leading to a misclassification bias of individual exposure. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

From the students screened during this mass survey, a stratified random sample of 64,660 students was analyzed for asthma prevalence and attack rate. Using a regression model to compare the USEPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards 2000 (NAAQS, 2000) to asthma prevalence, this investigation found that the standards may not provide enough protection for adolescents after controlling for age, rhinitis, eczema, urban birth location, parental education level, exercise, cigarette smoking, environmental tobacco smoking, alcohol beverage consumption and weather factors. The general estimating equations (GEE) model, a repeated measurement regression model, was used to examine the relationship between the monthly asthma attack rate among asthma patients and air pollution (nitrogen oxides; nitrogen dioxide; nitric oxide; Ozone; PM10) while controlling for household smoking. The GEE model demonstrated that air pollution is related to asthma attack rate. Air pollution factors also interacted with weather parameters when related to asthma attack rate. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {In Asia, limited literature has been published on the association between daily mortality and ambient air pollution. We examined the associations of daily cause-specific mortality with daily mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with a mass median aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM10) in Wuhan, China using 4 years of data (2001-2004). There are approximately 4.5 million residents in Wuhan who live in the city core area of 201 km2 where air pollution levels are higher and pollution ranges are wider than the majority of cities in the published literature. We use quasi-likelihood estimation within the context of the generalized additive models (GAMs) (natural spline (NS) models in R) to model the natural logarithm of the expected daily death counts as a function of the predictor variables. We found consistent PM10 effects on mortality with the strongest effects on lag 0 day. Every 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 daily concentration at lag 0 day was significantly associated with an increase in non-accidental (0.36%; 95% CI 0.19-0.53%), cardiovascular (0.51%; 95% CI 0.28-0.75%), stroke (0.44%; 95% CI 0.16-0.72%), cardiac (0.49%; 95% CI 0.08-0.89%), respiratory (0.71%; 95% CI 0.20-1.23%), and cardiopulmonary (0.46%; 95% CI 0.23-0.69%). In general, these effects were stronger among the elderly (≥65 years or ≥45 years) than among the young. The exploration of exposure-response relationships between PM10 and cause-specific mortality suggests the appropriateness of assuming linear relationships, where the PM10 concentration in Wuhan ranged from 24.8 to 477.8 μg/m3. We conclude that there is consistent evidence of acute effects of PM10 on cardiopulmonary mortality. A linear no threshold exposure-response relationship is suggested between PM10 and the studied cause-specific mortality. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: It is unclear why the neutrophil differential count in induced sputum (IS) from normal children is highly variable. Since levels of neutrophil chemoattractant cytokines and oxidative stress are determinants of airway neutrophilia in animal models, we sought to determine the association between IS neutrophils from healthy children and (i) interleukin-8 (IL-8) and (ii) the oxidative stress marker 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG). Methods: IS was done using hypertonic saline. The proportion (differential %) and the absolute number of IS neutrophils were determined by light microscopy. IS IL-8 and 8-oxodG were determined using ELISA. Spearman's rank correlation (Rs) was used to assess relationship between variables. Results: Adequate IS samples for analysis were obtained from 64/114 healthy children. The median (interquartile range) neutrophil differential count (n=64) was 20.6% (5.67-56), and absolute neutrophil count (n=53) was 0.11×106 (0.01-0.77). Both the % neutrophils, and the absolute neutrophil count were associated with IL-8 (Rs=0.67, p<0.0001 and 0.60, p<0.0001, respectively), but there was no association between IS neutrophil variables and 8-oxodG (n=40). The repeatability (intraclass correlation coefficient-Ri) of the neutrophil differential count was 0.58 (n=15). Conclusions: The variation in the proportion and number of neutrophils in the lower airway of healthy children is associated with IL-8, but not with oxidative stress. The IS neutrophil differential count in healthy children is relatively stable over several months. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be diagnosed when the FEV1/FVC ratio is below 70%, according to global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD). COPD is known as a disease which is frequently under-diagnosed. However, there is a risk of over diagnosis when this diagnostic threshold is applied among the elderly. Aims: To contribute to the discussion about the criteria for diagnosing COPD, by describing lung function and pulmonary symptoms in a population aged 60 years or more, and in particular the changes in the mean and 5% percentile of the FEV1/FVC ratio by increasing age. Methods: A cross sectional population-based study was performed in the city of Tromsø, Norway, in 2001-2002. Spirometry was performed in 4102 people 60 years and older (54.6% women), who also filled in a questionnaire. Results: Decreased FEV1% predicted and FEV1/FVC ratio were associated with smoking, increasing age, and reported pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. Dyspnoea and coughing were also strongly associated with smoking and reported pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases, but coughing did not become more frequent by increasing age. In never smokers aged 60-69 years the frequency of FEV1/FVC ratio<70% was approximately 7% compared to 16-18% in those 70 years or more (p<0.001). FEV1/FVC ratio<70% among never smokers aged 60-69 years was just as frequent as FEV1/FVC ratio <65% in never smokers older than 70 years. Conclusion: Adjustments of the GOLD criteria for diagnosing COPD are needed, and FEV1/FVC ratios down to 65% should be regarded as normal when aged 70 years and older. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Background: Due to the increasing importance of quality of life assessments in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, and the increased use of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) for comparative purposes it is essential to understand the relationship between health-related quality of life (HRQL) instruments and the ICF. Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the content of recommended COPD-specific HRQL instruments using the ICF as reference. COPD-specific instruments mentioned in widely accepted guidelines were linked to the ICF using standardized linking rules. The degree of agreement between various health professionals was assessed by calculating the kappa statistic. Results: Eleven instruments were included. They varied strongly in the number of concepts contained and the number of ICF categories used to map these concepts. A total of 548 concepts were identified and linked to 60 different ICF categories. Only the single category 'dyspnea' was covered by all instruments, whilst 21 categories were unique to specific instruments. The relationships of the measures with the ICF were identified. Conclusions: This study may aid researchers and clinicians to choose the most appropriate instrument for a specific purpose as well as help compare studies that have used different instruments for HRQL assessment. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of the study was to evaluate whether parental smoking might lead to asthma and allergies taking into account family history of asthma, personal atopy, breast feeding as confounders and owing pets and day-care during the first 6 months of life as modifiers. About 9000 children of fourth and fifth grade were selected in six cities of France. About 7798 answered an epidemiological questionnaire, underwent a medical examination including skin prick test positivity to common allergens, skin examination for eczema, and run test to assess exercise-induced asthma (EIA). Prevalence of allergies was, respectively, 25.2% for eczema, 12.9% for rhinitis, 9.9% for asthma and 25% for atopy. About 8.3% had an EIA. About 21.6% of children were exposed to maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy. Maternal smoking, in utero and later, was significantly related to lifetime wheezing (odds ratio (OR): 1.24[1.10-1.56]) and asthma (OR: 1.22[1.04-1.66]). There was no association between atopy, rhinitis, eczema and parental smoking, respectively. ETS remains a risk factor of wheezing in childhood. Counselling parents of children to quit smoking still remains a public health policy. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background: Fine particulate matter has been linked to allergies by experimental and epidemiological data having used aggregated data or concentrations provided by fixed-site monitoring stations, which may have led to misclassification of individual exposure to air pollution. Methods: A semi-individual design was employed to relate individual data on asthma and allergy of 5338 school children (10.4±0.7 years) attending 108 randomly chosen schools in 6 French cities to the concentrations of PM2.5 (fine particles with aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm) assessed in proximity of their homes. Children underwent a medical visit including skin prick test (SPT) to common allergens, exercise-induced bronchial (EIB) reactivity and skin examination for flexural dermatitis. Their parents filled in a standardised health questionnaire. Results: After adjustment for confounders and NO2 as a potential modifier, the odds of suffering from EIB and flexural dermatitis at the period of the survey, past year atopic asthma and SPT positivity to indoor allergens were significantly increased in residential settings with PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 10 μg/m3 (WHO air quality limit values). The relationships were strengthened in long-term residents (current address for at least 8 years). Conclusions: Findings support the hypothesis that changes in allergy prevalence observed in recent decades might be partly related to interactions between traffic-related air pollution and allergens. Further longitudinal investigations are needed to corroborate such results. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Atmospheric particulate matter (PM), an ingredient of urban pollution matter, is a mixture of solid and liquid particles differing in origin, dimension and composition. There is big concern about inhaled PM in urban areas, especially due to its adverse effects on the respiratory system. Diesel exhaust particulate (DEP), which constitutes the major part of PM, is characterized by a carbonic mixture composed of approximately 18,000 different high-molecular-weight organic compounds. Diesel engines release 10 times the amount of NO2 aldehydes and breathable PM compared to unleaded gasoline engines and more than 100 times that produced by catalysed gasoline engines; these data gain great significance when taken into account the fact that diesel-powered vehicles are becoming more and more popular. DEP polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), once deposited on airways mucous surfaces easily pass through epithelial cells (ECs) membranes, bind themselves to cytosolic receptors and then affect cell growth and differentiation. Human lung epithelial cells and macrophages engulf DEP, this resulting in increased proinflammatory cytokines release (IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF). We investigated the biological effects of DEP-PM on the human lung EC line A549. Light microscopy analysis suggested the presence of cell wall alterations, and provided evidence of PM internalization and cytoplasmic vacuolization. Following PM stimulation, nuclei also were seen undergo clear gross morphological modifications. Immunocytochemistry was used to detect intracytoplasmic IL-6 and IL-8 expression. © 2006.},

   abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an increasing health problem and one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, but knowledge about its pathogenesis has increased substantially in recent years. The disease results from interaction between individual risk factors (like enzymatic deficiencies) and environmental exposures to noxious agents, like cigarette smoking, occupational dusts, air pollution and infections in childhood. The main mechanisms that may contribute to airflow limitation in COPD are fixed narrowing of small airways, emphysema and luminal obstruction with mucus secretions. COPD is characterised by a chronic inflammatory process in the pulmonary tissue, with a pattern different from bronchial asthma, associated with extrapulmonary effects and is considered now a complex, systemic disease. Optimal therapeutic targeting of COPD depends on a clear understanding of the precise mechanisms of these complex processes and on early and correct evaluation of disease severity. A combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches is used to treat COPD. Bronchodilators are the mainstay of COPD treatment and can be combined with inhaled corticosteroids for greater efficacy and fewer side effects. The use of LTOT for hypoxemic patients has resulted in increased survival, and expanded drug therapy options have effectively improved dyspnoea and quality of life. Recent studies have documented the benefits of pulmonary rehabilitation. In addition, non-invasive mechanical ventilation offers new alternatives for patients with acute or chronic failure. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Inputs to the model are concentrations measured until 7 PM at the five stations on the present day plus measured and forecast values of meteorological variables. Outputs are the expected maxima concentrations for the following day at the site of the same five stations. The greatest of the concentrations among the five forecasts defines air quality for the following day. According to the range where the concentrations fall, three levels or classes of air quality are defined: good (A), bad (B) and critical (C). We have adjusted the parameters of the models using 2001 and 2002 data to forecast 2003 conditions and 2002 and 2003 data in order to forecast 2004 values. Forecast values using the neural model are compared with the results obtained with a linear model with the same input variables and with persistence.

   abstract = {Because of the high levels of pollution that Santiago de Chile experiences every year in winter, the government has set up an air quality monitoring network. Information from this network is employed to alert people about the quality of air and to enforce several control strategies in order to limit pollution levels. The monitoring network has 8 stations that measure PM10, carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3) and meteorological parameters. Some stations also measure nitrogen mono- and dioxide (NOx), fine particles (PM2.5) and carbon. In this study we have examined the PM10 and O3 data generated by this network in the year 2000 in order to determine the seasonal trends and spatial distribution of these pollutants over a year's period. The results show that concentration levels vary with the season, with PM10 being higher in winter and O3 in summer. All but one station, show a peak in PM10 at 8:00 indicating that during the rush hour there is a strong influence from traffic, however, this influence is not seen during the rest of the day. In winter, the PM10 maximum occurs at 24:00 h in all stations but Las Condes. This maximum is related to decreased wind speed and lower altitude of the inversion layer. The fact that Las Condes station is at a higher altitude than the others and it does not show the PM10 increase at night, suggest that the height of the inversion layer occurs at lower altitude. Cluster analysis was applied to the PM10 and O3 data, and the results indicate that the city has four large sectors with similar pollution behavior. The fact that both pollutants have similar distribution is a strong indication that the concentration levels are primarily determined by the topographical and meteorological characteristics of the area and that pollution generated over the city is redistributed in four large areas that have similar meteorological and topographical conditions. © 2006.},

Annual mean concentrations of benzene, CO, NO2, NOx, PM10 and SO2 were calculated, in front of the 108 schools attended by the children, by the validated STREET 5 software, which combines data on regional and local components of AP. STREET contains a database of emissions estimated by the IMPACT 2.0 software developed by ADEME-France and results of ambient concentrations modelled by the WinMISKAM 4.2 dispersion model. The input data required were background AP, traffic conditions (daily traffic density; average speed; percentage of gridlocks and proportion of each type of vehicle) and dispersion conditions (topography of the street segments modelled and meteorology). Emissions of air pollutants in front of the 108 schools were considerably scattered. Calculated concentrations (μg m-3) also varied considerably at: [1.0-5.1] for benzene, [303.8-988.1] for CO, [17.8-78.9] for NO2, [23.3-195.2] for NOx, [10.0-52.0] for PM 10 and [2.4-16.4] for SO2. About 64% (29%, respectively) of the schools had annual mean concentrations of NO2 (PM 10, respectively) exceeding the European quality objectives (40 and 30 μg m-3, respectively). These exposure indicators, capable of identifying small area variations in AP contrary to surrogate measures usually used in epidemiology, will enable better studies on the impact of urban AP on health. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {The importance of airborne particulate matter (PM) in causing increases in morbidity and mortality in humans has been confirmed by numerous epidemiological and laboratory studies. It has been proposed that PM might deliver transition metals to the airways were they react and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus promoting the expression of inflammatory mediators, and cytotoxicity. In Puerto Rico (PR), the northern Guaynabo area is a US EPA non-attainment zone for PM10 (PM with a mass median aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm), and a previous study found that organic PM10 extracts from this area were cytotoxic. The purpose of this research project is to compare the toxicity between organic PM extracts from Guaynabo (a coastal urban site) and Fajardo (a coastal rural town) based on their polarity, collection season, and geographical location. We will also evaluate if the metal content of such extracts is associated with their biological activity. PM10 filters from both locations were subjected to a sequential Soxhlet extraction using hexane and acetone. Normal and transformed bronchial epithelial cells were then exposed to the extracts. Using the neutral red assay to measure cell viability we found that coastal urban PM from PR generally exhibits higher cytotoxicity than coastal rural PM. However, this effect is dependent on the polarity of the extracts and the collection season (in winter hexane PM10 is more toxic, whereas during the summer acetone PM10 is more toxic). We also found that non-polar organic constituents in PM from PR are generally more toxic than the polar organic constituents. The main conclusion from this work is that the metal contents of the organic PM extracts from PR could play a minor role in the cytotoxicity observed. This is supported by the findings of elements such as As, V, Ni, and Cu in the most cytotoxic extracts. However, organic compounds probably play the major role. The presence of bioactive fractions of PM underscores the importance of conducting more detailed studies. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Cancer is a health endpoint influenced by a multitude of factors, including genetic history, individual behavior, and environmental insults. The ubiquity of toxicants in the environment has raised questions about the extent of their role in causing cancer in humans. More specifically, it is desirable to understand the cancer incidence due to airborne toxicants in anthropogenic pollution. One particular class of such pollutants is volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This paper reports an epidemiological investigation of the incidence of cancer in the 92 counties of Indiana. We evaluated the relationship between the amount of VOCs released in each county, as reported by the Toxic Release Inventory, and the county-by-county incidence of various types of cancer, especially those of less common organ systems not directly associated with the absorption or distribution of toxicants. Our evaluation considered chlorinated versus nonchlorinated emissions as well as stack versus fugitive emissions. We evaluated three models: linear, quadratic, and polynomial. Of these, the quadratic model appeared to be the best predictor (highest r2) for most endpoints for which there was a positive correlation. However, the linear model was the most sensitive (lowest P-value) for skin, melanoma, and endocrine-related cancers, including female genital system cancers. Our results indicate a relationship between emissions of VOCs and the incidence of some types of cancers. Most notable were strong correlations between VOC emissions and cancers of the brain, nervous system, endocrine system, and skin. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Unusual air pollution episodes, such as when smoke from wildfires covers a large urban area, can be used to attempt to detect associations between short-term increases in particulate matter (PM) concentrations and subsequent mortality without relying on the sophisticated statistical models that are typically required in the absence of such episodes. The objective of this study was to explore whether acute increases in PM concentrations from wildfire smoke cause acute increases in daily mortality. The temporal patterns of daily nonaccidental deaths and daily cardiorespiratory deaths for June of 2002 in the Denver metropolitan area were examined and compared to those in two nearby counties in Colorado that were not affected by the wildfire smoke and to daily deaths in Denver in June of 2001. Abrupt increases in PM concentrations in Denver occurred on 2 days in June of 2002 as a result of wildfire smoke drifting over the Denver area. Small peaks in mortality corresponded to both of the PM peaks, but the first mortality peak also corresponded to a peak of mortality in the control counties, and cardiorespiratory deaths began to increase on the day before the second peak. Further, there was no detectable increase in cardiorespiratory deaths in the hours immediately following the PM peaks. Although the findings from this study do not rule out the possibility of small increases in mortality due to abrupt and dramatic increases in PM concentrations from wildfire smoke, in a population of over 2 million people no perceptible increases in daily mortality could be attributed to such events. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Given the hypothesis that particulate air pollution is associated with systolic blood pressure, the effect of daily concentrations of air pollution on blood pressure was assessed in 2612 elderly subjects in the urban area of Bordeaux, France. Blood pressure was measured by a digital monitor. Particle concentrations (PM10) were obtained from the AIRAQ association that operates a local monitoring network of the air quality. To represent the ambient urban air pollution, stations had to be sufficiently correlated (i.e., correlation >0.70) and to have sufficiently similar mean levels of pollution. Linear regression was used to model the association between concentrations of particles (PM10) and systolic blood pressure. We observed associations between the fifth lag hour and systolic blood pressure for an increase of 10 μg/m 3 of PM10 (β=-1.12, 95% confidence interval: [-1.90; -0.30]). Despite contradictory results, fine particles must be considered nowadays as a major component of atmospheric air pollution in which everything must be put into practice in terms of public health actions in order to protect the general population and particularly the elderly group. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Urban centers in Latin American often face high levels of air pollution as a result of economic and industrial growth. Decisions with regard to industry, transportation, and development will affect air pollution and health both in the short term and in the far future through climate change. We investigated the pollution health consequences of modest changes in fossil fuel use for three case study cities in Latin American: Mexico City, Mexico; Santiago, Chile; and São Paulo, Brazil. Annual levels of ozone and particulate matter were estimated from 2000 to 2020 for two emissions scenarios: (1) business-as-usual based on current emissions patterns and regulatory trends and (2) a control policy aimed at lowering air pollution emissions. The resulting air pollution levels were linked to health endpoints through concentration-response functions derived from epidemiological studies, using local studies where available. Results indicate that the air pollution control policy would have vast health benefits for each of the three cities, averting numerous adverse health outcomes including over 156,000 deaths, 4 million asthma attacks, 300,000 children's medical visits, and almost 48,000 cases of chronic bronchitis in the three cities over the 20-year period. The economic value of the avoided health impacts is roughly $21 to $165 billion (US). Sensitivity analysis shows that the control policy yields significant health and economic benefits even with relaxed assumptions with regard to population growth, pollutant concentrations for the control policy, concentration-response functions, and economic value of health outcomes. This research demonstrates the health and economic burden from air pollution in Latin American urban centers and the magnitude of health benefits from control policies. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We carried out this mortality time series study in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to confirm these observations and to determine whether diabetics who had other health conditions were also at higher risk of dying when air pollution increases. Methods and results: In one analysis, we related daily deaths from diabetes (using the underlying cause) to daily concentrations of particles and gaseous pollutants. In another analysis, we created subgroups by identifying subjects diagnosed 1 year before death with diabetes and other major health conditions from billing and prescription data from the universal Quebec Health Insurance Plan. The analysis made use of parametric log-linear Poisson models that were adjusted for long-term temporal trends and daily weather conditions. We found positive associations between most air pollutants and daily mortality from diabetes as well as among subjects diagnosed with diabetes 1 year before death. In the latter group of subjects, greater effects were found generally in the warm season and especially among subjects who had diabetes and who also had any cardiovascular disease, chronic coronary disease, and atherosclerosis. We did not find evidence of associations among persons who only had diabetes (i.e., did not also have cancer, cardiovascular disease, or lower respiratory disease). Conclusions: These data indicate that individuals with diabetes who also have cardiovascular disease may be susceptible to the short-term effects of air pollution. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {We investigated whether exposure of alveolar macrophages to aggregates of ultrafine carbon particles affected subsequent phagocytosis of microorganisms. Human alveolar macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage and exposed to aggregates of ultrafine carbon particles or diesel exhaust particles (DEP) for 20 h before measurements of phagocytosis. The particle loads were estimated to be comparable to those of air pollution exposure with established health effects in humans. Phagocytotic activity was measured as attachment and ingestion of four different test particles (amorphous silica particles, yeast cells from Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans opsonized with specific IgG or fresh serum) that bind to scavenger, mannose, Fc, and complement receptors, respectively. Carbon preloading significantly impaired the attachment and ingestion process (P<0.01) for all particles, except for yeast cells from C. neoformans opsonized with specific IgG. On the average, the accumulated attachment decreased by 30% and the ingested fraction decreased by 10%. Loading of alveolar macrophages with either aggregates of ultrafine DEP or carbon particles impaired the phagocytosis of silica test particles in a similar way. Exposure of human alveolar macrophages to aggregates of carbon or DEP, in concentrations relevant to human environmental exposures, caused significant impairment of phagocytosis of silica particles and microorganisms. The inhibitory effect on particle phagocytosis mediated by four different receptors suggests that air pollution particles cause a general inhibition of macrophage phagocytosis. Such an effect may contribute to increased susceptibility to infections and, for example, result in more exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Background: Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been considered a disease of Caucasian men, recent data show mortality rising faster among women and African-Americans. Some have suggested these groups are more susceptible to tobacco smoke. We examined this issue in our own population of COPD patients. Methods: Beginning in March 2003 we prospectively developed a COPD research database to facilitate recruitment for clinical trials. Enrollees are recruited from clinics and paid advertising and their demographics, medical/smoking histories, and spirometric data are recorded. We examined the smoking histories and pulmonary function of enrollees over 45, with \{greater than or slanted equal to\}20 pack-years of smoking, FEV1/FVC (forced expiratory volume forced vital capacity) <0.70, and a race-adjusted post-bronchodilator FEV1<80%. The primary outcome was the loss of lung function per pack-year smoked, or Susceptibility Index (SI), calculated using the formula: (% predicted FEV1-100)/pack-years. Results: A total of 585 patients enrolled during the study period and 330 met our inclusion criteria. Caucasians were older than African-Americans (63 vs. 58, P = 0.0003) and had more pack-years of smoking (57 vs. 43, P = 0.0003). There were no differences in lung function or bronchodilator reversibility among the racial or gender subgroups. Caucasians had less loss of lung function per pack-year smoked than African-Americans ( SI = - 1.02 % vs. -1.34%, P = 0.007) and men less than women ( SI = - 0.98 % vs. -1.21%, P = 0.001). Caucasian males appeared relatively protected from tobacco smoke ( SI = - 0.93 %), while African-American women appeared most susceptible ( SI = - 1.42 %). Conclusions: There are important differences in racial and gender susceptibility to tobacco smoke among patients with COPD. African-American females appear to be at highest risk and may benefit most from smoking cessation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

IAP has been associated with many respiratory diseases, though it is not clear what relationship exists between biomass use and pulmonary function. Four groups containing 20 households each were selected in Santa Ana, Ecuador based on the relative amount of liquid petroleum gas and biomass fuel that they used for cooking. Pulmonary function tests were conducted on each available member of the households \{greater than or slanted equal to\}7 years of age. The pulmonary functions of both children (7-15 years) and women (\{greater than or slanted equal to\}16 years) were then compared between cooking fuel categories using multivariate linear regression, controlling for the effects of age, gender, height, and exposure to tobacco smoke. Among the 80 households, 77 children and 91 women performed acceptable and reproducible spirometry. In multivariate analysis, children living in homes that use biomass fuel and children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke had lower forced vital capacity and lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( P < 0.05). However, no significant difference in pulmonary function was observed among women in different cooking categories. Results of this study demonstrate the harmful effects of IAP from biomass smoke on the lung function of children and emphasize the need for public health efforts to decrease exposure to biomass smoke. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to determine the contribution of intensive cattle operations on ambient PM levels, more knowledge besides the elemental composition is necessary in order to distinguish between airborne PM from nearby agricultural fields, barren lands, or dirt roads. Here, as part of the San Joaquin Valley Fugitive Dust Characterization Study, surface soil samples collected from feedlots and open lot dairy farms are investigated for potential source specific molecular marker compounds. More than 100 organic compounds were quantified including: n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids, n-alkenoic acids, n-alkanols, n-alkanals, n-alkan-2-ones, steroids, triterpenoids, isoprenoids, and tocopherols (vitamin E) and metabolites. Biohydrogenation of plant lipids and sterols in the rumen results in distinctive alteration products. Animal and plant derived steroids are most abundant. Here, it is shown that 5β-stigmastanol and epi-5β-stigmastanol, two biohydrogenation products of sitosterol and stigmasterol, are the most distinctive molecular marker compounds. While stearic (C18) and palmitic (C16) acids are as individual compounds not source specific, biohydrogenation of the more abundant C18 unsaturated fatty acids, causes the ratio of C 18/C16 fatty acids to shift from below 0.5 for vegetation to an average of 3.0±0.7. Consequently, the C18/C16 fatty acid ratio is unique and can be used as well in source apportionment studies. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, the short-duration excursions of smoke often do not violate air quality standards at locations where air quality monitors are situated. The purpose of this study was to characterize the air quality in Pullman, WA during the fall 2002 prescribed field burning season, as part of a larger study conducted to examine community exposure to agricultural burning smoke and the related short-term health effects. Data collected included continuous PM2.5, PM10, CO2, nitrogen oxides, and 12-h integrated PM2.5, OC, EC, and levoglucosan (a biomass burning marker). Four episodes were defined when three consecutive 30-min PM2.5 averages exceeded 40 μg m-3. Two source-receptor models; the chemical mass balance model (CMB) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) were used to estimate smoke intrusion from regional agricultural burning. During this study, the average PM2.5, OC, and EC were similar during the daytime and nighttime, while LG was twice as high during the night. The CMB results showed major contributions of PM2.5 from soil (38%), vegetative burning (35%), and sulfate aerosol (20%), and much less from vehicles (2%) and cooking (1%). The 3-source profiles generated by PMF were consistent with those selected for CMB modeling. The PM2.5 estimates from these two models were highly correlated for individual sources. The LG, NO x, CO2, OC, and apportioned PM2.5 from vegetative burning and soil were higher during the episodes than during non-episode days, while EC and PM2.5 from secondary sulfate, vehicles, and cooking sources were similar throughout the study. We characterized the episodes of agricultural field burning with elevated LG, OC, and biomass burning contribution to PM2.5. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {High winds that blow sand from the desert regions of central Asia to points east are commonly known as Asian dust storms (ADS). In this paper we study the impact of an ADS on the PM2.5 aerosol extant in Tainan, a city in southern Taiwan. PM2.5 aerosol was collected at an urban and a coastal site in Tainan before the ADS (4-12 January 2001), during the ADS (13-16 January 2001), and the following summer (3-12 June 2001). Total PM2.5 mass was highest at both sites during the ADS despite already moderately high levels of PM2.5 beforehand, demonstrating that the ADS brought with it a significant amount of PM2.5 mass. The mass percentage of Ca2+ in PM2.5 increased noticeably during the ADS and there was a higher non-sea-salt SO42-/elemental carbon ratio. This latter change was due to a heightened level of non-sea-salt SO42-, which has a serious impact on air quality in southern Taiwan, and was likely sourced from sulfur integrated into the ADS aerosol as it passed major cities and industrial districts in China. The percentage water content in PM2.5 was at its lowest during the ADS. This was despite high levels of hygroscopic sulfate in the ADS aerosol and indicates that sulfate in the ADS may combine with Ca2+ to form CaSO4, a major component of ADS dust and one that does not have strong hygroscopic characteristics. Water content was at its highest in summer when winds arrive in Taiwan with elevated sea salt concentrations, having spent several days traversing the South China Sea. Non-ADS urban site aerosols were weakly acidic while coastal site aerosols were weakly alkaline. Urban site acidity was always higher than equivalent to coastal site acidity, due to locally produced acidic aerosols. Acidity peaked during the ADS, however, as a result of additional acidic aerosols transported by the ADS from urban and industrial regions in China. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The latter office was close to the smoking room, separated by a corridor. The coarse (PM10-2.1) and fine (PM2.1) fractions of PM10 collected in the monitored areas were analysed by scanning electron microscopy, equipped with a thin-window system for X-ray microanalysis (SEM/EDX). Photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to study the elemental composition of the particulate and to identify the chemical state of atomic species detected. Four clusters of particles for both "fine" and "coarse" fractions were identified: carbonaceous particles, soil erosion particles, Ca-sulphates and metal compound particles. EDX spectra showed that a percentage of carbonaceous particles carried S, Si and metal traces. High-resolution XPS spectra of the C1s region showed a significant greater occurrence of the C-O/C-N functional group in the particulate fine fraction collected in the smoking room compared to that collected outdoors. The carbonaceous component of coarse fraction collected in the smoking room appeared dissimilar from the same component detected in the other areas. After the 7-day absence of smokers this component of the PM10-2.1 fraction was similar to the corresponding coarse fraction collected at the outdoor location. The carbonaceous component of fine fraction collected in the smoking room, containing tobacco smoke products, such as organic carbon and nicotine, was traceable in the neighbouring areas, even several days after suspension of smoking activity. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The PM2.5 EFs from high and low combustion efficiency (CE) wheat burns were 0.8±0.4 and 4.7±0.4 g kg-1, respectively, and decreased with increasing CE. While these EFs are generally in agreement with literature, it is difficult to compare the PM2.5 EFs from KBG burns (12.1±1.4 g kg-1) due to the scarcity of published data. Wheat burns conducted with randomly piled stubble resulted in PM2.5 EFs different to those where the stubble was oriented as found in the field post harvest. Two separate methods for estimating EFs were employed and found to be in good agreement. The carbon in the biomass was almost quantitatively accounted for by measuring CO2, CO, total hydrocarbons (THC) and PM2.5 emissions. The PM2.5/CO emission ratios for wheat (0.05±0.01) agree with literature data, while the same ratio for KBG (0.23±0.02) was slightly higher than data reported. These ratios exhibit low dependence on CE and can be used to predict the level of one pollutant in a plume, when the concentration of the other is known. Wheat and KBG fields in 18 counties of eastern Washington and northern Idaho are burned on less than a tenth of the days of the year. Yet the fires were estimated to have produced between 0.04% and 34.5% of the total PM2.5 and CO emissions within the respective counties, during 2002. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {A receptor-oriented and a source-oriented approach are applied to assess the contribution of traffic emissions to concentration levels of fine particulate matter in Milan (Italy). Both the approaches are based on the comparison between seasonal weekends' and weekdays' data. Relative differences observed between Sundays' and weekdays' PM10 concentrations are analysed in terms of their probability distributions for the cold and warm season separately. As a consequence of the reduced circulating traffic flows, Sundays' concentration levels are on average about 20% lower, but an increase of concentration levels is sometimes observed under unfavourable meteorological conditions. The effect of the reduced traffic on Sundays is assessed also in terms of particles' number concentration. The results obtained by the analysis of weekly PM10 concentration data are compared to information derived from the emission inventory for traffic. From observed reduction of Sundays' traffic flow, the corresponding expected variation in primary PM10 emissions from traffic is calculated accounting for both exhaust and non-exhaust contribution. Seasonal probability distribution of PM10 emission variations are obtained by implementing the COPERT III methodology in a Monte Carlo simulation: on Sundays estimated values of PM10 emissions always result lower than on weekdays and on average about 50% less. Based on estimated reductions for PM10 traffic emission and on observed reductions for PM10 ambient air concentrations, traffic emissions appear responsible for about 50% of the PM10 concentration levels in the urban area. This contribution is both due to exhaust and non-exhaust emissions: depending on site exposure to the traffic source, out of the 50% contribution of total traffic emissions to PM10 concentrations, a 4-40% share is estimated to come directly from the exhaust, whereas the remaining share derives from non-exhaust emissions and resuspension of soil dust. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Aspergillus fumigatus and actinomycetes concentrations of 9.8-36.8×106 and 18.9-36.0×106 cfu m-3, respectively, measured during the active turning of green waste compost, were typically 3-log higher than previously reported concentrations from static compost windrows. Source depletion curves constructed for A. fumigatus during compost turning and modelled using SCREEN3 suggest that bioaerosol concentrations could reduce to background concentrations of 103 cfu m-3 within 100 m of this site. Authentic source term data produced from this study will help to refine the risk assessment methodologies that support improved permitting of compost facilities. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Real-time sampling of ambient particulate matter (PM) in the size range 0.23-10 μm and of carbonaceous matter concentrations has been carried out in a carefully designed field campaign in proximate paired neighborhoods in Haifa, Israel. The paired sites are characterized by a similar population density and neighborhood-wise socioeconomic (deprivation) index but show distinct canopy coverage. The data indicate clear sub-urban (neighborhood) scale variations in any measured PM attribute, such as concentrations, size distribution, and carbonaceous matter content. Mean ambient PM levels were comparatively higher than in other urban studies whereas carbonaceous airborne PM concentrations were lower. On top of the diurnal and seasonal variability and in spite of the significant regional effect of the semi-arid climate, local emissions and removal processes affect the PM concentrations to which people residing in urbanized regions are exposed. Analysis of possible mechanisms that could affect the observed spatial sub-urban PM differences, including local meteorology and emissions, reveal that sub-urban variability of removal processes has a major influence on ambient PM levels. Observations suggest that on top of the regional air masses which affect the city air quality and emissions from local sources, a normally unnoticed removal process, showing urban scale variability, is interception by trees and dense vegetation. In particular, the observed sub-urban variability in ambient PM concentrations is attributed, in part, to local variation of removal processes, among them the neighborhood-wise deposition on available surfaces, including canopy. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 27 major, minor and trace elements were determined by ED-XRF analysis. The PM2.5/PM10 concentration ratios averaged 0.8±0.2, while the corresponding elemental ratios ranged between 0.4±0.2 and 0.9±0.2. The concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were significantly higher (by 70% and 50%, respectively) in the smokers' rooms compared to the non-smokers' places. The total elemental concentrations were also higher in the smokers' rooms (11.5 vs 8.2 μg m-3 for PM2.5, and 10.3 vs 7.6 μg m-3 for PM2.5-10). Fine particle concentrations (PM2.5) were found to be quite proportional to smoking strength. On the contrary, the two environments exhibited similar coarse (PM2.5-10) particle fractions not related to the number of cigarettes smoked. A slight decrease of particle concentrations with increasing the floor level was also observed, particularly for PM2.5, suggesting that high-level floors are less impacted by near ground-level sources like traffic emissions. Finally, the removal efficiency of air purification systems was evaluated. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Light extinction, scattering, and absorption coefficients were measured simultaneously with a transmissometer, a nephelometer, and an aethalometer, respectively. Continuous aerosol chemical measurement was also made with Sunset elemental carbon/organic carbon (EC/OC) analyzers and on-line ion monitors. The mean light extinction budget for five major aerosol components; ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate, fine carbonaceous particles (EC and OC), fine soil, and coarse particle was estimated based on the measurement results. Investigation of the haze level revealed that PM2.5 mass concentrations at Junnong and Yonghyun measured under the Worst20% condition were approximately twice those of the Best20% condition. The worst visibility condition was well correlated with increases in mass concentrations of sulfate and nitrate, and EC particles. The mass concentration of aerosol components for the Worst20% was measured to be approximately two- to four-fold higher than those for the Best20%. Degree of visibility degradation was also analyzed based on the air mass pathway information obtained using the HYSPLIT model. Average light extinction coefficients under continental air flow condition at the Junnong and Yonghyun sites were the highest values of 704±414 and 773±546 Mm-1, respectively due to increased loading of fine particles. Visibility was greatly improved at both sites when atmosphere was impacted by air mass originated from Pacific Ocean. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Inputs to the model are concentrations measured until 7 PM at the five stations on the present day plus measured and forecast values of meteorological variables. Outputs are the expected maxima concentrations for the following day at the site of the same five stations. The greatest of the concentrations among the five forecasts defines air quality for the following day. According to the range where the concentrations fall, three levels or classes of air quality are defined: good (A), bad (B) and critical (C). We have adjusted the parameters of the models using 2001 and 2002 data to forecast 2003 conditions and 2002 and 2003 data in order to forecast 2004 values. Forecast values using the neural model are compared with the results obtained with a linear model with the same input variables and with persistence. According to the results reported here, overall, the neural model seems more accurate, although a good choice of input variables appears to be very important. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed that mass concentrations contained in TSP and PM2.5 were 124±44.1 and 62.12±20.5 μg m-3, respectively. The total sum of 16 USEPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) associated with TSP and PM2.5 ranged from 40.0 to 347 and 22.7 to 263 ng m-3, respectively. Five-ring and six-ring PAHs accounted for 73% of total PAHs. The average concentration of benzo(a) pyrene was 2-6 times higher than in other Asian cities. Concentrations of Cr, Cu and Zn in PM2.5 of Guiyu were 4-33 times higher than in other Asian countries. In general, there were significant correlations between concentrations of individual contaminants in TSP with PM2.5 (i.e. PAHs, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Zn, Mn except Ni and As). The high concentrations of both PAHs and heavy metals in air of Guiyu may impose a serious environmental and health concern. Cytotoxicity of the extract of TSP and PM2.5 of ten 24 h samples collected against human promonocytic leukemia cell line U937 (ATCC 1593.2) was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay.

   abstract = {The chemical composition of fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM2.5-10) particulate matter was investigated in 7-week field campaigns of contrasting air pollution at six urban background sites in Europe. The campaigns were scheduled to include seasons of local public health concern due to high particulate concentrations or findings in previously conducted epidemiological studies. The sampling campaigns were carried out as follows: Duisburg/Germany October-November 2002 (autumn), Prague/Czech Republic November 2002-January 2003 (winter), Amsterdam/Netherlands January-March 2003 (winter), Helsinki/Finland March-May 2003 (spring), Barcelona/Spain March-May 2003 (spring) and Athens/Greece June-July 2003 (summer). Aerosol samples were collected in 3+4-day periods per week (N=14) using two identical virtual impactors (VI). All the filter samples were analysed with the same instruments to obtain particulate mass, inorganic ions, total and watersoluble elements, and elemental and organic carbon content. The campaign means of PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 ranged from 8.3 to 30 and 5.4 to 29 μg m-3, respectively. The "wet and cool" seasons favoured a low coarse-to-fine particulate mass ratio (<1), whereas the ratio was high (>1) during the warmer and drier spring and summer campaigns. According to chemical mass closure, the major components in PM2.5 were carbonaceous compounds (organic matter+elemental carbon), secondary inorganic ions and sea salt, whereas those in PM2.5-10 were soil-derived compounds, carbonaceous compounds, sea salt and nitrate. The major and minor components together accounted for 79-106% and 77-96% of the gravimetrically measured PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 mass, respectively. In conclusion, the measured PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 in the campaigns could be reconstructed to a large extent with the help of harmonized particulate sampling and analysis of the selected chemical constituents. The health significance of the observed differences in chemical composition and emission sources between the size-segregated particulate samples will be investigated in toxicological cell and animal studies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

An empirical relationship between AOT and PM2.5 mass is obtained and results show that there is an excellent correlation between the bin-averaged daily mean satellite and ground-based values with a linear correlation coefficient of 0.96. Using meteorological and other ancillary datasets, we assess the effects of wind speed, cloud cover, and mixing height (MH) on particulate matter (PM) air quality and conclude that these data are necessary to further apply satellite data for air quality research. Our study clearly demonstrates that satellite-derived AOT is a good surrogate for monitoring PM air quality over the earth. However, our analysis shows that the PM2.5-AOT relationship strongly depends on aerosol concentrations, ambient relative humidity (RH), fractional cloud cover and height of the mixing layer. Highest correlation between MODIS AOT and PM2.5 mass is found under clear sky conditions with less than 40-50% RH and when atmospheric MH ranges from 100 to 200 m. Future remote sensing sensors such as Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) that have the capability to provide vertical distribution of aerosols will further enhance our ability to monitor and forecast air pollution.

The outdoor air concentrations of CO and PM10 were higher for the lower-floor apartments than for the higher-floor apartments, and they were significantly higher in the winter and summer. However, the difference of indoor concentrations between the lower-floor and higher-floor apartments depended upon the season. Most indoor and outdoor concentrations of PM10 were significantly higher in apartments, which were in close proximity to a major roadway, as compared to those further away, whereas the indoor and outdoor concentrations of CO did not vary much according to distances from major roadways. Atmospheric stability was important regarding the level of exposure to both CO and PM10 for residents of high-rise apartment buildings. These parameters (apartment floor, proximity to roadways, season, and atmospheric stability) should be considered when evaluating the level of exposure to CO and PM10 for residents living in high-rise apartment buildings. The median PM10 outdoor concentrations were close to or lower than the Korean annual standard for PM10 (70 μg m-3) or the American annual standard (50 μg m-3). Neither the median nor the maximum outdoor CO concentrations were higher than the Korean 8-h CO standard (9 ppm). However, the maximum PM10 concentrations substantially exceeded the Korean standard, thus suggesting the need for a management strategy regarding episodic ambient PM10 pollution. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The main objective of the present study was to determine the woodheater carrying capacity for Launceston-the number of woodheaters that can operate in the city without exceeding the Air NEPM. For this purpose, a prognostic meteorological and air pollution model called TAPM is used, coupled to a gridded woodheater PM10 emissions inventory. The latter was derived using information on dwelling density, the percentage of dwellings with woodheaters, woodheater emission rates and their diurnal and seasonal variations, and the proportions of compliant/non-compliant woodheaters and open fireplaces. The model simulations are performed for the year 1998, and the concentrations are scaled for previous and subsequent years using trends in woodheater numbers and types. The modelled number of exceedences of the Air NEPM for the period 1997-2004 is in good agreement with the observations. The modelling indicates that the PM10 Air NEPM would be met in Launceston when the total number of woodheaters is 20% of the total number of dwellings, of which 76%, 18%, 6% would be compliant woodheaters, non-compliant woodheaters and open fireplaces, respectively. With the present trends in the regional woodheater profile, this should occur in the year 2007. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {High-resolution maps of the mean concentrations of SO2, NO, NO2, O3, and PM10 in the period 2002-2004 were produced using half-hourly data from the local air quality monitoring network in Haifa Bay area, Israel. The network consists of 20 monitoring stations within an area of 206 km2, which encompasses a major industrial and power generation centre in the midst of a population of about 500 000. The pollutants' spatial features agree well with their known sources and the expected dispersion by the prevailing meteorology. The ranking of their spatial variations agree with published observations on larger spatial scales. The high-resolution maps capture in a small spatial scale the NOx and O3 cycle relationships expected by theory, and previously observed by analyses of monitoring time series. High correlation was found between the spatial patterns of the PM10, NOx and O3, whereas the correlation between the spatial features of the PM10 and SO2 is low. This suggests that the traffic, a major source of NOx, rather than industry, the major source of SO2, is the main contributor to the anthropogenic PM10 in the study area. This inference is corroborated by the low sulphur to nitrogen ratio throughout the region, which is typical of traffic-dominated pollution. A general conclusion drawn from this study is that high-resolution monitoring and mapping can significantly contribute to air quality management programmes in terms of both pollution abatement and exposure and risk assessment. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Particulate air pollution is associated with cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality in heavily populated urban centers of the United States. Because ambient fine particulate matter (aerodynamic diameter \{less-than or slanted equal to\}2.5 μm; PM2.5) is a complex mixture resulting from multiple sources and variable atmospheric conditions, it is difficult to identify specific components of PM2.5 that are responsible for adverse health effects. During four consecutive summers from 2000 to 2003 we characterized the ambient gaseous and PM2.5 air quality in an urban southwest Detroit community where childhood asthma hospitalization rates are more than twice the statewide average. Both integrated and continuous PM measurements together with gaseous air pollution measurements were performed using a mobile air research facility, AirCARE1, in which concurrent toxicological studies were being conducted. Chemical and physical characterizations of PM2.5 as well as receptor modeling using positive matrix factorization (PMF) were completed. Results from PMF indicated that six major sources contributed to the observed ambient PM2.5 mass during the summer months. Primary sources included (1) coal combustion/secondary sulfate aerosol, (2) motor vehicle/urban road dust, (3) municipal waste incinerators, (4) oil combustion/refineries, (5) sewage sludge incinerators, and (6) iron/steel manufacturing. Although the contribution of the coal/secondary sulfate aerosol source was greater than other factors, increased levels of urban PM2.5 from local combustion sources were also observed. In addition to characterization of ambient PM2.5 and their sources in southwest Detroit, this paper discusses possible associations of ambient PM2.5 from local combustion sources, specifically incinerator and refinery emissions and the observed adverse health effects during the inhalation exposure campaigns. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Because of the high levels of pollution that Santiago de Chile experiences every year in winter, the government has set up an air quality monitoring network. Information from this network is employed to alert people about the quality of air and to enforce several control strategies in order to limit pollution levels. The monitoring network has 8 stations that measure PM10, carbon monoxide (CO), sulphur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3) and meteorological parameters. Some stations also measure nitrogen mono- and dioxide (NOx), fine particles (PM2.5) and carbon. In this study we have examined the PM10 and O3 data generated by this network in the year 2000 in order to determine the seasonal trends and spatial distribution of these pollutants over a year's period. The results show that concentration levels vary with the season, with PM10 being higher in winter and O3 in summer. All but one station, show a peak in PM10 at 8:00 indicating that during the rush hour there is a strong influence from traffic, however, this influence is not seen during the rest of the day. In winter, the PM10 maximum occurs at 24:00 h in all stations but Las Condes. This maximum is related to decreased wind speed and lower altitude of the inversion layer. The fact that Las Condes station is at a higher altitude than the others and it does not show the PM10 increase at night, suggest that the height of the inversion layer occurs at lower altitude. Cluster analysis was applied to the PM10 and O3 data, and the results indicate that the city has four large sectors with similar pollution behavior. The fact that both pollutants have similar distribution is a strong indication that the concentration levels are primarily determined by the topographical and meteorological characteristics of the area and that pollution generated over the city is redistributed in four large areas that have similar meteorological and topographical conditions. © 2006.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this work was to estimate exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TAP), of the 6683 schoolchildren included in a cross-sectional epidemiological study conducted in six French cities to determine the effects of urban air pollution (AP) on respiratory and allergic health. Annual mean concentrations of benzene, CO, NO2, NOx, PM10 and SO2 were calculated, in front of the 108 schools attended by the children, by the validated STREET 5 software, which combines data on regional and local components of AP. STREET contains a database of emissions estimated by the IMPACT 2.0 software developed by ADEME-France and results of ambient concentrations modelled by the WinMISKAM 4.2 dispersion model. The input data required were background AP, traffic conditions (daily traffic density; average speed; percentage of gridlocks and proportion of each type of vehicle) and dispersion conditions (topography of the street segments modelled and meteorology). Emissions of air pollutants in front of the 108 schools were considerably scattered. Calculated concentrations (μg m-3) also varied considerably at: [1.0-5.1] for benzene, [303.8-988.1] for CO, [17.8-78.9] for NO2, [23.3-195.2] for NOx, [10.0-52.0] for PM 10 and [2.4-16.4] for SO2. About 64% (29%, respectively) of the schools had annual mean concentrations of NO2 (PM 10, respectively) exceeding the European quality objectives (40 and 30 μg m-3, respectively). These exposure indicators, capable of identifying small area variations in AP contrary to surrogate measures usually used in epidemiology, will enable better studies on the impact of urban AP on health. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Dry deposition fluxes of particulates and concentrations of total suspended particulate, fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM2.5-10) particulate matters were collected at Taichung harbor sampling sites from August 2004 to January 2005. Chemical analyses of metallic elements were made using a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer coupled with hollow cathode lamps. Concentrations of metal elements in the forms of coarse particles and fine particles as well as the coarse/fine particulate ratios were presented. Statistical methods such as correlation analysis, principal component analysis and enrichment factor analysis were performed to compare the chemical components and identify possible emission sources at the sampling sites. Metallic elements of Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Ni and Mg had higher EFcrust ratios in winter and spring than in summer and autumn. Diurnal and nocturnal variations of metallic element concentrations in fine and coarse particles were also discussed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Also the average dry deposition velocities (for TSP) for metallic elements Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Pb, Cr and Mg were 2.6, 1.0, 1.9, 0.2, 1.7, 0.6 and 1.4 (cm s-1), respectively, at the harbor sampling site. In addition, metallic element concentrations and compositions in fine and coarse particulate for air sampling were also analyzed in this study. The average total suspended particulate concentrations with metallic elements Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Pb, Cr and Mg were 116.3, 119.4, 148.8, 139.9, 46.1, 24.4 and 88.5 ng m-3, respectively. The average ratios of coarse to fine for metallic elements Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Pb, Cr and Mg were about 1.9, 2.7, 3.8, 2.9, 1.6, 2.5 and 2.1, respectively. The results reflected that coarse particulate concentrations of metallic elements were the major species at the Taichung harbor sampling site. The results also identified dust, vehicle emissions and marine salt as the sources of fine particulates at Taichung Harbor near the Taiwan Strait. Most of the flux is due to particles larger than 2.5 μm in size due to their high deposition velocities. The result also indicates that the best approach to estimate overall dry deposition is by using either coarse particle or total particle concentrations. © 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The study was based on pre-industrial and recent data series, the results being analyzed according to the atmospheric chemistry. The treatment of ozone and meteorological data was performed by classical statistics and by time-series analysis. It was concluded that in the 19th century the ozone present in the troposphere was not of photochemical origin, being possible to consider the respective concentrations as reference values. For recent data a cycle of 8 h for ozone concentrations could be related to traffic. Compared to the 19th century, the current concentrations were 147% higher (252% higher in May) due to the increased photochemical production associated with the increased anthropogenic emissions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The database was collected in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, during two consecutive years. Measurements of all environmental variables were performed at the same site continuously 5 days a week except during winter months. The airborne concentrations of biological and non-biological pollutants ranged as follows: total fungi: 184-16 979 spores m-3; total pollen: 0-6692 pollen m-3; PM10: 6.70-65.38 μg m-3; PM 2.5: 5.04-45.02 μg m-3; and ozone: 2.54-64.17 ppb. Higher levels of total inhalable fungi and particulate matter were found during fall and summer months. In contrast, total pollen concentration showed elevated levels in spring. Peak concentrations of ozone were observed during summer and beginning of fall. Our study concluded that several types of inhalable airborne fungi and pollen, particulate matter, and ozone could be positively correlated as a result of the atmospheric temperature influence. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanical wear of asbestos-free brake linings of road vehicles contributed to the concentration of Cu and Sb on average by 69% and 66%, respectively in the PM10 size fraction. Tire rubber abrasion was a major source for atmospheric Zn; on average, non-crustal sources accounted for 67% of Zn in the PM10 size fraction.

   abstract = {The importance of airborne particulate matter (PM) in causing increases in morbidity and mortality in humans has been confirmed by numerous epidemiological and laboratory studies. It has been proposed that PM might deliver transition metals to the airways were they react and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), thus promoting the expression of inflammatory mediators, and cytotoxicity. In Puerto Rico (PR), the northern Guaynabo area is a US EPA non-attainment zone for PM10 (PM with a mass median aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm), and a previous study found that organic PM10 extracts from this area were cytotoxic. The purpose of this research project is to compare the toxicity between organic PM extracts from Guaynabo (a coastal urban site) and Fajardo (a coastal rural town) based on their polarity, collection season, and geographical location. We will also evaluate if the metal content of such extracts is associated with their biological activity. PM10 filters from both locations were subjected to a sequential Soxhlet extraction using hexane and acetone. Normal and transformed bronchial epithelial cells were then exposed to the extracts. Using the neutral red assay to measure cell viability we found that coastal urban PM from PR generally exhibits higher cytotoxicity than coastal rural PM. However, this effect is dependent on the polarity of the extracts and the collection season (in winter hexane PM10 is more toxic, whereas during the summer acetone PM10 is more toxic). We also found that non-polar organic constituents in PM from PR are generally more toxic than the polar organic constituents. The main conclusion from this work is that the metal contents of the organic PM extracts from PR could play a minor role in the cytotoxicity observed. This is supported by the findings of elements such as As, V, Ni, and Cu in the most cytotoxic extracts. However, organic compounds probably play the major role. The presence of bioactive fractions of PM underscores the importance of conducting more detailed studies. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We forecast childhood lead poisoning and residential lead paint hazard prevalence for 1990-2010, based on a previously unvalidated model that combines national blood lead data with three different housing data sets. The housing data sets, which describe trends in housing demolition, rehabilitation, window replacement, and lead paint, are the American Housing Survey, the Residential Energy Consumption Survey, and the National Lead Paint Survey. Blood lead data are principally from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. New data now make it possible to validate the midpoint of the forecast time period. For the year 2000, the model predicted 23.3 million pre-1960 housing units with lead paint hazards, compared to an empirical HUD estimate of 20.6 million units. Further, the model predicted 498,000 children with elevated blood lead levels (EBL) in 2000, compared to a CDC empirical estimate of 434,000. The model predictions were well within 95% confidence intervals of empirical estimates for both residential lead paint hazard and blood lead outcome measures. The model shows that window replacement explains a large part of the dramatic reduction in lead poisoning that occurred from 1990 to 2000. Here, the construction of the model is described and updated through 2010 using new data. Further declines in childhood lead poisoning are achievable, but the goal of eliminating children's blood lead levels ≥10 μg/dL by 2010 is unlikely to be achieved without additional action. A window replacement policy will yield multiple benefits of lead poisoning prevention, increased home energy efficiency, decreased power plant emissions, improved housing affordability, and other previously unrecognized benefits. Finally, combining housing and health data could be applied to forecasting other housing-related diseases and injuries. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this we measured the blood levels of cadmium among 80 Ukrainian children and evaluated sources of exposure. A nested case-control study from a prospective cohort of Ukrainian 3-year-old children was conducted. We evaluated predictors of elevated blood cadmium using a multivariable logistic regression model. The model included socioeconomic data, parent occupation, environmental tobacco smoke, hygiene, body-mass index, and diet. Dietary habits were evaluated using the 1992 Block-NCI-HHHQ Dietary Food Frequency survey. Elevated cadmium was defined as blood levels in the upper quartile (≥0.25 μg/L). The mean age for all 80 children was 36.6 months. Geometric mean cadmium level was 0.21 μg/L (range=0.11-0.42 μg/L; SD=0.05). Blood cadmium levels were higher among children taking zinc supplements (0.25 vs 0.21 μg/L; P = 0.032), children who ate sausage more than once per week (0.23 vs 0.20; P = 0.007) and children whose fathers worked in a by-product coking industry (0.25 vs 0.21; P = 0.056). In the multivariable model, predictors of elevated blood cadmium levels included zinc supplementation (adjusted OR=14.16; P < 0.01), father working in a by-product coking industry (adjusted OR=8.50; P = 0.03), and low body mass index (<14.5; adjusted OR=5.67; P = 0.03). This is the first study to indicate a strong association between elevated blood cadmium levels and zinc supplementation in young children.

   abstract = {Cancer is a health endpoint influenced by a multitude of factors, including genetic history, individual behavior, and environmental insults. The ubiquity of toxicants in the environment has raised questions about the extent of their role in causing cancer in humans. More specifically, it is desirable to understand the cancer incidence due to airborne toxicants in anthropogenic pollution. One particular class of such pollutants is volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This paper reports an epidemiological investigation of the incidence of cancer in the 92 counties of Indiana. We evaluated the relationship between the amount of VOCs released in each county, as reported by the Toxic Release Inventory, and the county-by-county incidence of various types of cancer, especially those of less common organ systems not directly associated with the absorption or distribution of toxicants. Our evaluation considered chlorinated versus nonchlorinated emissions as well as stack versus fugitive emissions. We evaluated three models: linear, quadratic, and polynomial. Of these, the quadratic model appeared to be the best predictor (highest r2) for most endpoints for which there was a positive correlation. However, the linear model was the most sensitive (lowest P-value) for skin, melanoma, and endocrine-related cancers, including female genital system cancers. Our results indicate a relationship between emissions of VOCs and the incidence of some types of cancers. Most notable were strong correlations between VOC emissions and cancers of the brain, nervous system, endocrine system, and skin. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Results revealed seasonal and locational variation in all of the parameters studied. The highest levels of pollution were detected during winter, especially after a rainfall or after a discharge from Wadi Gaza. Locations associated with sewage discharge had the highest fecal indicator levels. Statistical analysis of the data demonstrated significant linear correlations between several parameters (e.g., DO and biochemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand and fecal coliforms, biochemical oxygen demand and fecal streptococci). © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {We investigated whether exposure of alveolar macrophages to aggregates of ultrafine carbon particles affected subsequent phagocytosis of microorganisms. Human alveolar macrophages were obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage and exposed to aggregates of ultrafine carbon particles or diesel exhaust particles (DEP) for 20 h before measurements of phagocytosis. The particle loads were estimated to be comparable to those of air pollution exposure with established health effects in humans. Phagocytotic activity was measured as attachment and ingestion of four different test particles (amorphous silica particles, yeast cells from Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans opsonized with specific IgG or fresh serum) that bind to scavenger, mannose, Fc, and complement receptors, respectively. Carbon preloading significantly impaired the attachment and ingestion process (P<0.01) for all particles, except for yeast cells from C. neoformans opsonized with specific IgG. On the average, the accumulated attachment decreased by 30% and the ingested fraction decreased by 10%. Loading of alveolar macrophages with either aggregates of ultrafine DEP or carbon particles impaired the phagocytosis of silica test particles in a similar way. Exposure of human alveolar macrophages to aggregates of carbon or DEP, in concentrations relevant to human environmental exposures, caused significant impairment of phagocytosis of silica particles and microorganisms. The inhibitory effect on particle phagocytosis mediated by four different receptors suggests that air pollution particles cause a general inhibition of macrophage phagocytosis. Such an effect may contribute to increased susceptibility to infections and, for example, result in more exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {On May 24-25, 2005 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the US Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the University of Michigan sponsored a technical workshop on the topic of connecting social and environmental factors to measure and track environmental health disparities. The workshop was designed to develop a transdisciplinary scientific foundation for exploring the conceptual issues, data needs, and policy applications associated with social and environmental factors used to measure and track racial, ethnic, and class disparities in environmental health. Papers, presentations, and discussions focused on the use of multilevel analysis to study environmental health disparities, the development of an organizing framework for evaluating health disparities, the development of indicators, and the generation of community-based participatory approaches for indicator development and use. Group exercises were conducted to identify preliminary lists of priority health outcomes and potential indicators and to discuss policy implications and next steps. Three critical issues that stem from the workshop were: (a) stronger funding support is needed for community-based participatory research in environmental health disparities, (b) race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position need to be included in environmental health surveillance and research, and (c) models to elucidate the interrelations between social, physical, and built environments should continue to be developed and empirically tested.},

Available: http://www.healthypeople.gov/Publications/ [accessed May 22, 2004]] has established as a top priority the elimination of health disparities. Current research suggests that characteristics of the social, physical and built environment contribute to these disparities. In order to track progress and to assess the potential contributions of the various components of the "environment," tools specific to environmental health disparities are required. In this paper, we discuss one potential tool, a set of candidate measures that may be used to track disparities in outcomes, as well as measures that may be used analytically to assess potential causal pathways. Several other reports on health and environmental measures have been produced, including the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) America's Children and the Environment. However, there has not been a comprehensive discussion about environmental measures that focus on racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in health. Therefore, we focus on measures specific to historically disadvantaged populations. Based on a conceptual framework that views health disparities as partially driven by differential access to resources and exposures to hazards, we group the measures into four categories: social processes, environmental contaminants/exposures, bodyburdens of environmental contaminants, and health outcomes. We provide a few examples to illustrate each category, including residential segregation, PM2.5 exposures, blood mercury concentrations, and asthma morbidity and mortality. These measures and categories are derived from a review of environmental health disparities from several disciplines. As a next step in a long-term effort to better understand the relationship between social disadvantage, environment, and health disparities, we hope that the proposed measures and literature review serve as a foundation for future monitoring of environmental health disparities. These efforts may aid community organizations, local agencies, scientists and policy makers in allocating resources and developing interventions. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Environmental health researchers, sociologists, policy-makers, and activists concerned about environmental justice argue that communities of color who are segregated in neighborhoods with high levels of poverty and material deprivation are also disproportionately exposed to physical environments that adversely affect their health and well-being. Examining these issues through the lens of racial residential segregation can offer new insights into the junctures of the political economy of social inequality with discrimination, environmental degradation, and health. More importantly, this line of inquiry may highlight whether observed pollution-health outcome relationships are modified by segregation and whether segregation patterns impact diverse communities differently. This paper examines theoretical and methodological questions related to racial residential segregation and environmental health disparities. We begin with an overview of race-based segregation in the United States and propose a framework for understanding its implications for environmental health disparities. We then discuss applications of segregation measures for assessing disparities in ambient air pollution burdens across racial groups and go on to discuss the applicability of these methods for other environmental exposures and health outcomes. We conclude with a discussion of the research and policy implications of understanding how racial residential segregation impacts environmental health disparities. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Unusual air pollution episodes, such as when smoke from wildfires covers a large urban area, can be used to attempt to detect associations between short-term increases in particulate matter (PM) concentrations and subsequent mortality without relying on the sophisticated statistical models that are typically required in the absence of such episodes. The objective of this study was to explore whether acute increases in PM concentrations from wildfire smoke cause acute increases in daily mortality. The temporal patterns of daily nonaccidental deaths and daily cardiorespiratory deaths for June of 2002 in the Denver metropolitan area were examined and compared to those in two nearby counties in Colorado that were not affected by the wildfire smoke and to daily deaths in Denver in June of 2001. Abrupt increases in PM concentrations in Denver occurred on 2 days in June of 2002 as a result of wildfire smoke drifting over the Denver area. Small peaks in mortality corresponded to both of the PM peaks, but the first mortality peak also corresponded to a peak of mortality in the control counties, and cardiorespiratory deaths began to increase on the day before the second peak. Further, there was no detectable increase in cardiorespiratory deaths in the hours immediately following the PM peaks. Although the findings from this study do not rule out the possibility of small increases in mortality due to abrupt and dramatic increases in PM concentrations from wildfire smoke, in a population of over 2 million people no perceptible increases in daily mortality could be attributed to such events. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Blood pressure was measured by a digital monitor. Particle concentrations (PM10) were obtained from the AIRAQ association that operates a local monitoring network of the air quality. To represent the ambient urban air pollution, stations had to be sufficiently correlated (i.e., correlation >0.70) and to have sufficiently similar mean levels of pollution. Linear regression was used to model the association between concentrations of particles (PM10) and systolic blood pressure. We observed associations between the fifth lag hour and systolic blood pressure for an increase of 10 μg/m 3 of PM10 (β=-1.12, 95% confidence interval: [-1.90; -0.30]). Despite contradictory results, fine particles must be considered nowadays as a major component of atmospheric air pollution in which everything must be put into practice in terms of public health actions in order to protect the general population and particularly the elderly group. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Urban centers in Latin American often face high levels of air pollution as a result of economic and industrial growth. Decisions with regard to industry, transportation, and development will affect air pollution and health both in the short term and in the far future through climate change. We investigated the pollution health consequences of modest changes in fossil fuel use for three case study cities in Latin American: Mexico City, Mexico; Santiago, Chile; and São Paulo, Brazil. Annual levels of ozone and particulate matter were estimated from 2000 to 2020 for two emissions scenarios: (1) business-as-usual based on current emissions patterns and regulatory trends and (2) a control policy aimed at lowering air pollution emissions. The resulting air pollution levels were linked to health endpoints through concentration-response functions derived from epidemiological studies, using local studies where available. Results indicate that the air pollution control policy would have vast health benefits for each of the three cities, averting numerous adverse health outcomes including over 156,000 deaths, 4 million asthma attacks, 300,000 children's medical visits, and almost 48,000 cases of chronic bronchitis in the three cities over the 20-year period. The economic value of the avoided health impacts is roughly $21 to $165 billion (US). Sensitivity analysis shows that the control policy yields significant health and economic benefits even with relaxed assumptions with regard to population growth, pollutant concentrations for the control policy, concentration-response functions, and economic value of health outcomes. This research demonstrates the health and economic burden from air pollution in Latin American urban centers and the magnitude of health benefits from control policies. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Background: Recent studies suggest that persons with diabetes and with cardiovascular disease may be at higher risk for the short-term effects of air pollution. We carried out this mortality time series study in Montreal, Quebec, Canada to confirm these observations and to determine whether diabetics who had other health conditions were also at higher risk of dying when air pollution increases. Methods and results: In one analysis, we related daily deaths from diabetes (using the underlying cause) to daily concentrations of particles and gaseous pollutants. In another analysis, we created subgroups by identifying subjects diagnosed 1 year before death with diabetes and other major health conditions from billing and prescription data from the universal Quebec Health Insurance Plan. The analysis made use of parametric log-linear Poisson models that were adjusted for long-term temporal trends and daily weather conditions. We found positive associations between most air pollutants and daily mortality from diabetes as well as among subjects diagnosed with diabetes 1 year before death. In the latter group of subjects, greater effects were found generally in the warm season and especially among subjects who had diabetes and who also had any cardiovascular disease, chronic coronary disease, and atherosclerosis. We did not find evidence of associations among persons who only had diabetes (i.e., did not also have cancer, cardiovascular disease, or lower respiratory disease). Conclusions: These data indicate that individuals with diabetes who also have cardiovascular disease may be susceptible to the short-term effects of air pollution. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Malignant mesothelioma (mesothelioma) is rare. We conducted the first systematic study of the epidemiology of mesothelioma in Hong Kong from 1988 to May 2002 by reviewing medical records. Mesothelioma patients were identified from the database of 12 out of 20 hospitals that would have admitted mesothelioma patients territory-wide. These 12 hospitals served 73% of the total hospital bed-years of the 20 hospitals. We identified 67 mesothelioma patients. The estimated annual incidence was one per million, which was similar to the background incidence of one to two per million among Caucasians. Occupational history was available in 43 subjects. Three quarters of mesothelioma patients with available occupational history had occupational asbestos exposure. Restricting analysis to 48 patients with accessible medical records and using 67 occupational asbestosis patients for comparison, the epidemiology of mesothelioma in Hong Kong shares similarities with the literature: mean age of 63 years upon diagnosis, mean latency of 46 years, median survival of 9.5 months, male predominance, selective presentation among women, high prevalence among workers in ships and dockyards, predominantly epithelioid type, lower prevalence of asbestos bodies, and negative association with pleural plaques. Asbestos consumption in Hong Kong rose in the 1970s and peaked in early 1980s and late 1990s. Hong Kong may encounter an epidemic of mesothelioma in the 2010s if effective occupational asbestos control measures are not in place. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We were interested in investigating whether this measurement can be used as a tool to screen and identify school children with asthma. To do this, FeNO was measured using an on-line single exhalation analyser in 368 children aged 8-10 years in six Oxfordshire primary schools, by two investigators blinded to the disease status of the children. The children were then categorised into 'normal', 'atopic asthma', 'non-atopic asthma' and 'atopy only' groups, according to their responses to the ISAAC questionnaire and perusal of the children's medical records kept by their family practitioners. Increased levels of FeNO were found in 'atopic asthmatic', 'non-atopic asthmatics' and 'atopic only' groups (median values of 24.4, 7.8 and 15.3 ppb, respectively, compared to normal controls' of 6.9 ppb). Levels were increased in atopic children regardless of whether they had asthma and were significantly higher than non-atopic asthmatics. We conclude that FeNO measurement is not a useful tool for identifying children with asthma in the community, as increased levels did not discriminate between those with asthmatic and atopic symptoms. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Objective: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a slowly progressive condition characterised by poorly reversible airflow limitation associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lung. The main causal factors of COPD are chronic oxidative stress as a result of long-term smoking, use of biomass fuels, and air pollution. In this study, basal levels of DNA strand breaks were investigated together with some additional oxidative markers implicating oxidative damage on the other biomolecules such as proteins and lipids in patients with COPD who were exposed to smoking and biomass. Material and methods: We detected DNA strand breaks in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes by using a Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (also called Comet Assay), plasma protein carbonyl (PC) content by using Reznick and Parker's spectrophotometric method, and lipid peroxidation by measurement of malondialdehyde (MDA) as indexes of oxidative stress in 47 patients with smoking-related COPD and 25 patients with biomass-related COPD and 36 age-and-sex matched control participants. Results: The mean values of DNA strand breaks, MDA and protein carbonyl levels were significantly higher in smoking- and biomass-related COPD groups than in the control group (ANOVA P<0.001, <0.05 and <0.05, respectively). DNA damage levels were also higher in smoking-related COPD group than in biomass-related COPD group (P<0.05). There was a positive relationship between DNA damage and MDA levels in smoking-related COPD group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Oxidative stress markers and DNA damage were strongly increased in both patient groups with smoking- and biomass-related COPD. However, DNA is more affected in smoking-related COPD patients than in biomass-related COPD. These data indicate that cigarette smoking is a more significant DNA damaging risk factor than biomass smoke. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Some have suggested these groups are more susceptible to tobacco smoke. We examined this issue in our own population of COPD patients. Methods: Beginning in March 2003 we prospectively developed a COPD research database to facilitate recruitment for clinical trials. Enrollees are recruited from clinics and paid advertising and their demographics, medical/smoking histories, and spirometric data are recorded. We examined the smoking histories and pulmonary function of enrollees over 45, with \{greater than or slanted equal to\}20 pack-years of smoking, FEV1/FVC (forced expiratory volume forced vital capacity) <0.70, and a race-adjusted post-bronchodilator FEV1<80%. The primary outcome was the loss of lung function per pack-year smoked, or Susceptibility Index (SI), calculated using the formula: (% predicted FEV1-100)/pack-years. Results: A total of 585 patients enrolled during the study period and 330 met our inclusion criteria. Caucasians were older than African-Americans (63 vs. 58, P = 0.0003) and had more pack-years of smoking (57 vs. 43, P = 0.0003). There were no differences in lung function or bronchodilator reversibility among the racial or gender subgroups. Caucasians had less loss of lung function per pack-year smoked than African-Americans ( SI = - 1.02 % vs. -1.34%, P = 0.007) and men less than women ( SI = - 0.98 % vs. -1.21%, P = 0.001). Caucasian males appeared relatively protected from tobacco smoke ( SI = - 0.93 %), while African-American women appeared most susceptible ( SI = - 1.42 %). Conclusions: There are important differences in racial and gender susceptibility to tobacco smoke among patients with COPD. African-American females appear to be at highest risk and may benefit most from smoking cessation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in nonatopic children with asthma-like airway disease that recur despite conventional asthma treatment and to evaluate the clinical response to lansoprazole treatment. Twent-five nonatopic children aged between 1 and 16 years who have asthma-like airway disease and 25 healthy children were included in the study. All cases underwent 24 h pH monitoring with dual sensor catheters. Additionally, acid suppressor treatment was administered to patients diagnosed as having GERD and clinical response was evaluated. Major symptoms encountered in the patient group included wheezing and cough (88%, and 32%, respectively). Reflux episodes were more common in distal esophagus during the prone position (reflux index (RI) of 11.5±10.3 vs. 16.2±9.4 during supine vs. prone). All distal esophageal parameters were significantly higher in the patient group except number of reflux episodes lasting longer than 5 min (RI of 13.3±13.1 vs. 3.9±2.9 in the patient vs. control groups, respectively). There was a significant improvement in symptoms and requirement for medication with treatment (number of systems decreased from 2.3±0.6 to 0.4±0.6, P = 0.00). In conclusion, GERD is significantly more common in nonatopic children with asthma-like airway disease compared to the controls and clinical improvement is significant after acid suppressor treatment. Thus, we suggest that children followed-up with the diagnosis of nonatopic asthma with recurrent exacerbations despite adequate asthma treatment have a high frequency of GER and that lansoprazole treatment may be considered early in management. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

IAP has been associated with many respiratory diseases, though it is not clear what relationship exists between biomass use and pulmonary function. Four groups containing 20 households each were selected in Santa Ana, Ecuador based on the relative amount of liquid petroleum gas and biomass fuel that they used for cooking. Pulmonary function tests were conducted on each available member of the households \{greater than or slanted equal to\}7 years of age. The pulmonary functions of both children (7-15 years) and women (\{greater than or slanted equal to\}16 years) were then compared between cooking fuel categories using multivariate linear regression, controlling for the effects of age, gender, height, and exposure to tobacco smoke. Among the 80 households, 77 children and 91 women performed acceptable and reproducible spirometry. In multivariate analysis, children living in homes that use biomass fuel and children exposed to environmental tobacco smoke had lower forced vital capacity and lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s ( P < 0.05). However, no significant difference in pulmonary function was observed among women in different cooking categories. Results of this study demonstrate the harmful effects of IAP from biomass smoke on the lung function of children and emphasize the need for public health efforts to decrease exposure to biomass smoke. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Respiratory diseases may cause considerable disability in the elderly because of their limited respiratory reserve related to aging. This study aimed to assess the time trend of respiratory symptoms and common chronic respiratory diseases in the elderly Chinese living in Hong Kong. Two questionnaire surveys were conducted in 1991-1992 and 2003-2004. Subjects aged ≥70 years were invited to complete a respiratory questionnaire. A total of 2032 (999 male) and 1524 (698 male) subjects completed the questionnaire surveys in 1991 and 2003, respectively. The response rates were 60% in 1991 and 78% in 2003. The prevalence of most respiratory symptoms increased over time after adjusting the data for age, sex, social status and smoking habits. Comparing the symptoms between 1991 and 2003, wheeze over the past 12 months increased from 7.5 to 12.1% (adjusted OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.54-2.61) and morning chest tightness from 4.2 to 8.8% (adjusted OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.79-3.43). The prevalence of self-reported physician-diagnosed emphysema increased over time (2.4-3.1%, adjusted OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.12-2.86), but there was no change for asthma (5.1% in 1991 and 5.8% in 2003) or chronic bronchitis (6.7% in 1991 and 7.7% in 2003). The prevalence of respiratory symptoms has increased over the past 12 years and this may be related to environmental factors especially increasing air pollution in Hong Kong. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 756 individuals in three population strata (elderly, students, and workers) provided first morning void urine specimens the day after exposure and food surveys were administered. Arsenic intake from drinking water was estimated from analysis of tap water samples, plus 24-h dietary recall and food frequency questionnaires. Multilevel analysis was used to evaluate the effects of the age group and city factors adjusted by predictor variables. Arsenic levels in drinking water and urine were significantly higher in Antofagasta compared with the other cities. City-and individual-level factors, 12% and 88%, respectively, accounted for the variability in urinary arsenic concentration. The main predictors of urinary arsenic concentration were total arsenic consumption through water and age. These findings indicate that arsenic concentration in drinking water continues to be the principal contributing factor to exposure to inorganic arsenic in the Chilean population. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Epidemiological data show an association between exposure to elevated levels of particulate matter (PM), in particular the fine fraction (<2.5 μm in diameter), and an increase in cardiovascular mortality and respiratory symptoms. The aim of this study was to compare the in vitro toxicity of coarse and fine particulate matter collected with a cascade impactor during winter in an urban area of Rome in relation to their physicochemical characterization (size distribution and chemical composition) as assessed by analytical electron microscopy (SEM/EDX). The X-ray microanalysis data of single particles of coarse and fine matter were analyzed by hierarchical cluster analysis to determine the principal component of the two granulometric fractions. The main chemical difference between the two fractions was the greater abundance of carbonaceous particles in the fine fraction. We compared the ability of coarse and fine fractions, carbon black (CB), and residual oil fly ash (ROFA) to induce arachidonic acid release and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production in the monocytic-macrophagic RAW 264.7 cell line at concentrations of 30 and 120 μg/mL. Our results showed that CB and ROFA were consistently less effective than both fractions of urban particles at inducing an inflammatory reaction in RAW 264.7 cells. Both PM fractions dose-dependently increased TNF-α production in RAW 264.7 cells after 5 and 24 h of incubation, and only the TNF-α production induced by coarse particles at 30 μg/mL decreased significantly (P<0.01) after 24 h of treatment. In our in vitro model the winter fine fraction was more reactive than the winter coarse fraction, in contrast to a previously examined summer sample. In the summer sample, coarse particles produced higher levels of inflammatory mediators than fine particles and the CB was consistently less effective than the urban particles. The different behaviors between summer and winter urban fractions may be due to their different physicochemical characteristics; in fact, the comparison of the two samples' characterization by SEM/EDX and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that in winter the carbonaceous particles are more abundant than in summer and that winter particles carry a greater quantity of organic compounds. We suggest that the higher concentration of organic compounds on fine carbonaceous particles may partially explain the higher activation of RAW 264.7 cells by fine particles. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this study was to assess the possible associations of ADS on the hospital stroke admissions of residents in Taipei, Taiwan, during the period from 1996 to 2001. We identified 54 dust storm episodes, which were classified as index days. Daily stroke admissions on the index days were compared with admissions on the comparison days. We selected two comparison days for each index day, 7 days before the index days and 7 days after the index days. The study results indicated a statistically significant association between ADS events and daily primary intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke admissions 3 days after the event (relative risk of 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-10.10). We also found a positive but nonsignificant association between ADS events and ischemic stroke admissions 3 days following the dust storms. This was due mainly to PM10. We conclude that more attention be given to ADS events and health in the future. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Hospital admissions for CVD and ambient air pollution data for Taipei were obtained for the period 1997-2001. The relative risk of hospital admission was estimated using a case-crossover approach, controlling for weather variables, day of the week, seasonality, and long-term time trends. For the one-pollutant models, on warm days (≥20°C) statistically significant positive associations were found between levels of particulate matter <10-μm aerodynamic diameter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3). On cool days (< 20°C), all pollutants except O3 and SO 2 were significantly associated with CVD admissions. For the two-pollutant models, CO, NO2, and O3 were significant in combination with each of the other four pollutants on warm days. On cool days, PM10 remained statistically significant in all the two-pollutant models. This study provides evidence that higher levels of ambient pollutants increase the risk of hospital admissions for CVD. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The concentration of suspended particulate matters (SPMs) 10 μm or less in diameter were hypothetically converted to PM 2.5 values (converted PM2.5 or cPM2.5) by using a conversion factor obtained from 25 estimates in Japan. Among various causes of death, a significant correlation was observed between both the SPM and cPM2.5 (SPM/cPM2.5) levels and the age-adjusted death rates of ischemic heart disease or hypertensive heart disease in both genders. Correlation was noted with pneumonia, asthma, chronic bronchitis/emphysema, or lung cancer only in females. Unexpectedly, breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer also showed significant increases in mortality rates related to the SPM/cPM2.5 level, suggesting a role for suspended particles in the ambient air with or without gaseous component as a possible endocrine- disrupting, estrogenic agent. Multivariate regression analysis of confounding factors, smoking rate, population density, and hormone-related factors revealed consistent significance of SPM/cPM2.5 in these diseases. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {A model for simulating desert dust cycle was adapted and applied for a dust storm case in the southwest United States (US). This is an initial test of the model's capability as part of a future public health early warning system. The modeled meteorological fields, which drive a dust storm, were evaluated against surface and upper-air measurement data. The modeled dust fields were compared with satellite images, in situ surface PM2.5 and PM10 data, and visibility data in the areas affected by the dust event. The model predicted meteorological fields reasonably well. The modeled surface and upper-air field patterns were in agreement with the measured ones. The vertical profiles of wind, temperature, and humidity followed closely with the observed profiles. Statistical analyses of modeled and observed meteorological variables at surface sites showed fairly good model performance. The modeled dust spatial distributions were comparable with the satellite-observed dust clouds and the reduced visibility patterns. Most encouragingly, the model-predicted and observed PM2.5 peak hours matched reasonably well. The model produced better PM2.5 peak hours than PM10 peak hours. The temporal varying trends of daily and hourly PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations at most of the measurement sites were similar to those observed. Discrepancies between the values of the modeled and the measured surface PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations differed with time and location. Sometimes the modeled and measured concentrations can have one order of magnitude differences. These revealed there were possible deficiencies in the simulation of the dust production strength and location, and the representation of dust particle size in the modeling. Better land surface data and size representation of the dust production are expected to further improve model performance. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We present a proof-of-concept analysis of the measurement of the health damage of ozone (O3) produced from nitrogen oxides (NO x=NO+NO2) emitted by individual large point sources in the eastern United States. We use a regional atmospheric model of the eastern United States, the Comprehensive Air quality Model with Extensions (CAMx), to quantify the variable impact that a fixed quantity of NOx emitted from individual sources can have on the downwind concentration of surface O 3, depending on temperature and local biogenic hydrocarbon emissions. We also examine the dependence of resulting O3-related health damages on the size of the exposed population. The investigation is relevant to the increasingly widely used "cap and trade" approach to NO x regulation, which presumes that shifts of emissions over time and space, holding the total fixed over the course of the summer O3 season, will have minimal effect on the environmental outcome. By contrast, we show that a shift of a unit of NOx emissions from one place or time to another could result in large changes in resulting health effects due to O3 formation and exposure. We indicate how the type of modeling carried out here might be used to attach externality-correcting prices to emissions. Charging emitters fees that are commensurate with the damage caused by their NOx emissions would create an incentive for emitters to reduce emissions at times and in locations where they cause the largest damage. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This pollution source is of particular concern in Mexico, where a large share of electricity is generated by the burning of high-sulfur fuel oil. In this paper, we estimate the health impacts due to air pollution from one of the Mexico's largest power plants, Tuxpan, located on the eastern coast. We calculate the annual average concentrations of primary and secondary (sulfates and nitrates) particulate matter, by modeling representative periods during the year 2001 using the CALPUFF-CALMET modeling system. We find that emissions from the power plant resulted in annual average concentrations of 0.12 μg m-3 (min-max: 0.00-1.43) for primary PM2.5, 0.64 μg m-3 (0.01-2.84) for secondary PM2.5 and 3.09 μg m-3 (0.01-41.54) for SO2 in the 120 km×120 km modeling domain. Such concentrations, while mostly affecting a relatively rural area, could result in significant public health and economic impacts for the local population. It is important to consider such damages when evaluating different electricity generation and control technologies. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {There is increasingly growing evidence linking urban air pollution to acute and chronic illnesses amongst all age groups. Therefore, monitoring of ambient concentrations of various air pollutants as well as quantification of the dose inhaled becomes quite important, specially in view of the fact that in many countries, policy decisions for reducing pollutant concentrations are mainly taken on the basis of their health impacts. The dose when gets combined with the likely responses, indicates the ultimate health risk (HR). Thus, as an extension of our earlier studies, HR has been estimated for three pollutants, namely, suspended particulate matter (SPM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) for Delhi City in India. For estimation and analyses, three zones have been considered, namely, residential, industrial and commercial. The total population has been divided into three age classes (infants, children and adults) with different body weights and breathing rates. The exercise takes into account age-specific breathing rates, body weights for different age categories and occupancy factors for different zones. Results indicate that health risks due to air pollution in Delhi are highest for children. For all age categories, health risks due to SO2 (HR_SO 2) are the lowest. Hence, HR_SO2 has been taken as the reference with respect to which HR values due to SPM and NO2 have been compared. Taking into account all the age categories and their occupancy in different zones, average HR values for NO2 and SPM turn out to be respectively 22.11 and 16.13 times more than that for SO2. The present study can be useful in generating public awareness as well as in averting and mitigating the health risks. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Epidemiological studies typically utilise one or few central monitoring stations as a proxy for personal exposure to particulate matter air pollution. However, recent research indicates that central monitoring sites may not accurately characterize the spatial complexities of the particulate field across an urban area. Consequently, intraurban assessment of exposure to air pollution has become a priority area of study. This paper reviews particulate air pollution exposure studies with a focus on monitored-data studies at the intraurban spatial scale. Portions of the literature provide contradictory conclusions as to the homogeneity of intraurban particulate concentrations, due in part to local conditions such as source composition, meteorology, locations of monitoring sites and topography, but which may also be a result of the methods and definitions used to quantify relative and absolute spatial concentration variations. Comparative analyses of the literature by particle size fraction, method of determining heterogeneity, and sampling characteristics were performed. We find that particular attention should be given to local conditions and methods when using one or few monitoring sites to characterise wider population exposures. The utilisation of absolute and relative measures of homogeneity such as the coefficient of divergence which are based on data from several monitoring sites (e.g., n>4) in combination with an appropriate sample size (e.g., n≥50) may reduce the possibility of misclassification based on incorrect assumptions about heterogeneity. The errors in exposure misclassification based on these assumptions about intraurban concentration variations are especially critical in long-term cohort epidemiological analyses that assess the effects of exposure variations in air pollution upon health. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

We regressed the logarithm of daily counts of acute COPD hospitalization during the 5-year period from 1994 to 1998 on the daily mean levels of each pollutant, after accounting for seasonal and subseasonal fluctuations, non-Poisson dispersion, and weather variables. Nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide were significantly associated with hospitalization for COPD, and the magnitude of effects was increased slightly with increasing days of exposure averaging, with the relative risk for a 7-day average being 1.11 (95%CI: 1.04, 1.20) and 1.08 (1.02, 1.13) for nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, respectively. There was no significant association between either sulfur dioxide or ozone and COPD hospitalization. The combined relative risk for all four gaseous pollutants on COPD hospitalization was 1.21. The effects of gaseous pollutants on COPD hospitalization were not significant after adjustment for PM10, although its inclusion did not have a marked effect on the point estimates for relative risks. Nitrogen dioxide has a significant impact on COPD hospitalization. Further studies are needed to separate the effects of single pollutants from the combined effects of the complex mixture of air pollutants in urban atmospheres. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Detailed respiratory symptoms were collected with a standard questionnaire adapted from that of the British Medical Research Council. Exposure was calculated as the average hours spent daily for cooking multiplied by the number of years. CAD were defined as either chronic airway obstruction (CAO; (forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity)<0.70), chronic bronchitis, or chronic bronchitis with CAO. The prevalence of CAD in the exposed group was found to be higher than that in the LPG group (28.5% vs. 13.6%, crude odds ratios (ORs) 2.5 (1.5-4.0), P=0.0001). The fraction of CAD attributed to exposure to biomass smoke after adjusting for possible confounding factors was 23.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 13.4-33.2). Acute symptoms during exposure to biomass smoke were important predictors for the presence of CAD. Biomass smoke pollution is an important contributing factor in the development of CAD in nonsmoking women living in a rural area. The presence of acute symptoms during cooking in women in rural areas should signal to general practitioners the possibility of CAD. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Motor vehicle traffic contributes to more than 50% of PM10 in Europe and might have far reaching impacts on human health. We investigated the relationship between residential street type as a surrogate for traffic intensity and the prevalence of respiratory symptoms, atopic diseases, and allergic sensitization in adults. Data from 6896 subjects of the German Health Survey 1998 with complete information on residential street type were used. Multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to model associations between street type categories, and respiratory and atopic outcomes were assessed by screening questionnaire of The European Respiratory Health Survey and specific IgE measurements. Living at extremely or considerably busy roads (23.9% of total study population) compared to roads with no or rare traffic (64.5%) was statistically significantly associated with chronic bronchitis (aOR 1.36 (95% CI) (1.01-1.83)) while nocturnal coughing attacks (past 12 months) (1.24 (0.98-1.57)), wheeze during the past 12 months (1.21 (0.93-57)), and hay fever (1.16 (0.94-1.42)) were marginally increased after adjustment for several potential confounders and for multiple testing. No increased risks were found for asthma (0.97 (0.67-1.42)) and allergic sensitization (1.05 (0.91-1.20)). We conclude that exposure to traffic-related air pollutants increases the risk of nonallergic respiratory symptoms and to a lesser degree the risk of hay fever and allergic sensitization but not the risk of asthma in adults. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {The relationship of inorganic arsenic exposure through drinking water and total urinary arsenic excretion in a nonoccupationally exposed population was evaluated in a cross-sectional study in three mayor cities of Chile (Antofagasta, Santiago, and Temuco). A total of 756 individuals in three population strata (elderly, students, and workers) provided first morning void urine specimens the day after exposure and food surveys were administered. Arsenic intake from drinking water was estimated from analysis of tap water samples, plus 24-h dietary recall and food frequency questionnaires. Multilevel analysis was used to evaluate the effects of the age group and city factors adjusted by predictor variables. Arsenic levels in drinking water and urine were significantly higher in Antofagasta compared with the other cities. City-and individual-level factors, 12% and 88%, respectively, accounted for the variability in urinary arsenic concentration. The main predictors of urinary arsenic concentration were total arsenic consumption through water and age. These findings indicate that arsenic concentration in drinking water continues to be the principal contributing factor to exposure to inorganic arsenic in the Chilean population. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Epidemiological data show an association between exposure to elevated levels of particulate matter (PM), in particular the fine fraction (<2.5 μm in diameter), and an increase in cardiovascular mortality and respiratory symptoms. The aim of this study was to compare the in vitro toxicity of coarse and fine particulate matter collected with a cascade impactor during winter in an urban area of Rome in relation to their physicochemical characterization (size distribution and chemical composition) as assessed by analytical electron microscopy (SEM/EDX). The X-ray microanalysis data of single particles of coarse and fine matter were analyzed by hierarchical cluster analysis to determine the principal component of the two granulometric fractions. The main chemical difference between the two fractions was the greater abundance of carbonaceous particles in the fine fraction. We compared the ability of coarse and fine fractions, carbon black (CB), and residual oil fly ash (ROFA) to induce arachidonic acid release and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) production in the monocytic-macrophagic RAW 264.7 cell line at concentrations of 30 and 120 μg/mL. Our results showed that CB and ROFA were consistently less effective than both fractions of urban particles at inducing an inflammatory reaction in RAW 264.7 cells. Both PM fractions dose-dependently increased TNF-α production in RAW 264.7 cells after 5 and 24 h of incubation, and only the TNF-α production induced by coarse particles at 30 μg/mL decreased significantly (P<0.01) after 24 h of treatment. In our in vitro model the winter fine fraction was more reactive than the winter coarse fraction, in contrast to a previously examined summer sample. In the summer sample, coarse particles produced higher levels of inflammatory mediators than fine particles and the CB was consistently less effective than the urban particles. The different behaviors between summer and winter urban fractions may be due to their different physicochemical characteristics; in fact, the comparison of the two samples' characterization by SEM/EDX and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that in winter the carbonaceous particles are more abundant than in summer and that winter particles carry a greater quantity of organic compounds. We suggest that the higher concentration of organic compounds on fine carbonaceous particles may partially explain the higher activation of RAW 264.7 cells by fine particles. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Immunological studies claimed that atopic and non-atopic asthma share more similarities than differences. However, these two phenotypes of asthma are considered to be distinguishable upon distinct clinical patterns, which were not systematically assessed before in a large population. We studied characteristics discriminating atopic from non-atopic asthma among 751 asthmatic patients and 80 factors were analysed in univariate and multivariate analysis. Age, age of onset of asthma, female/male ratio were higher in non-atopic (n = 200) than in atopic (n = 551) asthmatics. Familial asthma, seasonal symptoms, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, allergen-triggered symptoms, improvement in altitude, exercise-induced asthma were associated with atopy. Non-atopic asthmatics displayed lower FEV1 and FVC. Smoking was more frequent and asthma was more severe in these patients. Younger age, early onset, male sex, rhinitis and smoking were independent factors discriminating atopic from non-atopic asthma. This study establishes in a large population of asthmatics that although similarities exist between atopic and non-atopic asthma, two clinical phenotypes can still distinguish both kinds of asthma. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {There is evidence indicating that oxidants play a pivotal role in determining air pollution-dependent lung injury. In the present study we explored the role of oxidants present in ambient particles in causing damage to the mucociliary epithelium. We explored the protective effects of pretreatment with three substances (n-propyl gallate, dl-α-tocopherol acetate, and EDTA) on the frog palate exposed to residual oil fly ash (ROFA). The parameters analyzed were mucociliary transport (MCT) and ciliary beating frequency (CBF) after 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 120 min of exposure. MCT was decreased significantly by ROFA (P<0.001), with a significant interaction effect (P=0.02) between the duration of exposure and treatment with antioxidants. The inhibitory effects on MCT of the substances tested were significantly different (P=0.002); vitamin E was similar to control (Ringer) and different from all other groups. CBF showed no significant effect of duration of exposure (P=0.465), but a significant interaction between duration of exposure and treatments was observed (P=0.011). Significant differences were detected among treatments (P<0.001), with ROFA and n-propyl gallate at concentrations of 50 μM presenting a short-lived increase in CBF, which was not observed in the remaining groups. The results showed that both MCT and CBF were affected within a short period (100 min) of exposure to ROFA and that the presence of antioxidant substances, such as vitamin E (4 mg/mL) and n-propyl gallate (300 μM), protected against the mucociliary impairment induced by ROFA on the frog palate. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In recent years, the widespread use of high-resolution imaging modalities employed in the struggle against cancer, coinciding with the peak of the asbestos epidemic, have boosted the detection frequency of RA. However, its differential diagnosis still poses a challenge to the pulmonary specialist and the radiologist, as little is known about its pathogenesis. Furthermore, the multifactorial etiology of RA and its occasional coexistence with lung cancer make the task of confidently ruling out malignancy sometimes daunting. This article attempts to provide an update on RA's etiology, radiological evaluation, clinical management, and prognosis based on recent advances in broadly available diagnostic modalities and minimally invasive interventional procedures. An exemplary case of post-tuberculous RA is illustrated, as RA often presents as an unusual finding of a fairly common disease. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {COPD is characterised by damage to small airways due to an inflammatory process as well as an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants. Several cytokines and cell adhesion molecules enhancing a mainly neutrophilic inflammation have been associated with COPD. The aim of the study was to investigate whether inflammation or oxidative markers gave an indication of the course of COPD during an exacerbation. Fourteen patients with moderate to severe COPD admitted to the St. Antonius Hospital because of an exacerbation have been monitored during treatment with prednisolone 50 mg intravenously during 24 h at admission, reduced to 25 mg at day 3 and tapered off with oral prednisolone at day 7. On three separate occasions, day 1, 3 and 7, H2 O2 in exhaled air, IL-8 and the soluble cell adhesion molecule sICAM and sE-selectin in serum were measured. We compared the patients at day 1 with healthy controls (in both non-smokers and smokers). Furthermore, we examined the changes from the study group in time during therapy. At admission all the markers were raised in comparison with the control groups. During treatment H2O2 concentrations in breath condensate declined significantly (P<0.001) as well as IL-8 and sICAM in serum (P=0.002, respectively, P<0.001). There was no significant change in sE-selectin (P=0.132). No significant improvement has been found in spirometry. These data suggest that the markers H2O2 in exhaled air, IL-8 and sICAM in serum are suitable markers in monitoring exacerbated COPD. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The objective of this study was to assess the possible associations of ADS on the hospital stroke admissions of residents in Taipei, Taiwan, during the period from 1996 to 2001. We identified 54 dust storm episodes, which were classified as index days. Daily stroke admissions on the index days were compared with admissions on the comparison days. We selected two comparison days for each index day, 7 days before the index days and 7 days after the index days. The study results indicated a statistically significant association between ADS events and daily primary intracerebral hemorrhagic stroke admissions 3 days after the event (relative risk of 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-10.10). We also found a positive but nonsignificant association between ADS events and ischemic stroke admissions 3 days following the dust storms. This was due mainly to PM10. We conclude that more attention be given to ADS events and health in the future. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {An assessment of the air quality of Zaragoza (Spain) was performed by determining the trace element content in airborne PM10 in a sampling campaign from July 2001 to July 2002. Samples were collected in a heavy traffic area with a high volume air sampler provided with a PM10 cutoff inlet. The levels of 16 elements (Al, Ba, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Sr, V, and Zn) were quantified after collecting the PM10 on Teflon-coated glass fiber filters (GFF). Regarding the PM10, 32% exceedance of the proposed PM10 daily limit was obtained, some of them corresponding to summer and autumn periods. The limit values of toxic trace elements from US-EPA, WHO, and EC were not exceeded, considering Zaragoza as a moderately polluted city under the current air quality guidelines. The contribution of anthropogenic sources to atmospheric elemental levels was reflected by the high values of enrichment factors for Zn, Pb, and Cu compared to the average crustal composition. Statistical analyses also determined the contribution of different sources to the PM10, finding that vehicle traffic and anthropogenic emissions related to combustion and industrial processes were the main pollutant sources as well as natural sources associated with transport of dust from Africa for specific dates. Regarding the influence of meteorological conditions on PM10 and trace elements concentrations, it was found that calm weather conditions with low wind speed favor the PM10 collection and the pollution for trace elements, suggesting the influence of local sources. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Workers chronically exposed to high-intensity/low-frequency noise at textile plants show increased frequency of respiratory infections. This phenomenon prompted the herein investigation on the cytology of the bronchial epithelium of Wistar rats submitted to textile noise. Workplace noise from a cotton-mill room of a textile factory was recorded and reproduced in a sound-insulated animal room. The Wistar rats were submitted to a weekly schedule of noise treatment that was similar to that of the textile workers (8 h/day, 5 days/week). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to compare the fine morphology of the inner surface of the bronchi in noise-exposed and control rats. SEM quantitative cytology revealed that exposure to noise for 5-7 months caused inhibition in the natural expansion of the area occupied by ciliated cells on the bronchial epithelium as adult rats grow older. This difference between noise-exposed and age-matched control rats was statistically significant (P<0.05) and documents that the cytology of the rat bronchial epithelium is mildly altered by noise exposure. The decrease in the area of bronchial cilia may impair the mucociliar clearance of the respiratory airways and, thus, increase vulnerability to respiratory infection. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, the association between self-reported ETS exposure and serum cotinine levels was examined. As part of the population-based Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study in Beaver Dam, WI, self-reported data on ETS were obtained at the 5-year follow-up examination (1998-2000; n=2800). Serum cotinine levels were obtained on 643 of these participants (53-75 years old). Serum cotinine levels increased with reported number of hours of recent ETS exposure. Most (95.3%) participants who reported being smokers had serum cotinine levels >15ng/mL, compared with only 2.7% of nonsmokers. Usual ETS exposure among nonsmokers was assessed with a brief questionnaire quantifying exposure at work, at home, and in social settings, and then classified into three levels of exposure. Those reporting little or no exposure had a geometric mean cotinine level of 0.06ng/mL (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05, 0.07), compared with 0.14 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.22) and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.36, 1.10) for those reporting moderate and high ETS exposure, respectively (F-test for trend: P<0.0001).

Objective: To study the relationship between exhaled NO levels in schoolchildren in relation to IgE sensitisation and allergenic and non-allergenic environmental factors. Method: This study comprised 374 schoolchildren (13-14 years of age) who performed exhaled NO-measurements and skin prick tests. Exposure to allergens, respiratory infections, environmental tobacco smoke and home window pane condensation, the latter an indicator of high humidity and poor ventilation was evaluated through questionnaires. Results: In IgE-sensitised children sensitisation to pets was a more important determinant of exhaled NO than sensitisation to pollen. Higher NO levels were found in cat-sensitised children with a cat or other furred pets at home compared to cat-sensitised children without pets (geometric mean, 24.0 vs. 13.9 ppb, P = 0.03). Significantly higher exhaled NO levels were found in non-sensitised children that reported having a cold (5.7 vs. 3.8 ppb, P<0.001) or lived in homes with window pane condensation (7.1 vs. 4.4 ppb, P=0.01) than in non-sensitised children without a cold and window pane condensation, respectively. These associations were not found in children that were sensitised to inhalation allergens. Conclusion. Allergen exposure seems to be the most important determinant for exhaled NO levels in IgE-sensitised children whereas in non-sensitised children NO levels were associated with respiratory infections and home window pane condensation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide were significantly associated with hospitalization for COPD, and the magnitude of effects was increased slightly with increasing days of exposure averaging, with the relative risk for a 7-day average being 1.11 (95%CI: 1.04, 1.20) and 1.08 (1.02, 1.13) for nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, respectively. There was no significant association between either sulfur dioxide or ozone and COPD hospitalization. The combined relative risk for all four gaseous pollutants on COPD hospitalization was 1.21. The effects of gaseous pollutants on COPD hospitalization were not significant after adjustment for PM10, although its inclusion did not have a marked effect on the point estimates for relative risks. Nitrogen dioxide has a significant impact on COPD hospitalization. Further studies are needed to separate the effects of single pollutants from the combined effects of the complex mixture of air pollutants in urban atmospheres. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Detailed respiratory symptoms were collected with a standard questionnaire adapted from that of the British Medical Research Council. Exposure was calculated as the average hours spent daily for cooking multiplied by the number of years. CAD were defined as either chronic airway obstruction (CAO; (forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity)<0.70), chronic bronchitis, or chronic bronchitis with CAO. The prevalence of CAD in the exposed group was found to be higher than that in the LPG group (28.5% vs. 13.6%, crude odds ratios (ORs) 2.5 (1.5-4.0), P=0.0001). The fraction of CAD attributed to exposure to biomass smoke after adjusting for possible confounding factors was 23.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 13.4-33.2). Acute symptoms during exposure to biomass smoke were important predictors for the presence of CAD. Biomass smoke pollution is an important contributing factor in the development of CAD in nonsmoking women living in a rural area. The presence of acute symptoms during cooking in women in rural areas should signal to general practitioners the possibility of CAD. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Motor vehicle traffic contributes to more than 50% of PM10 in Europe and might have far reaching impacts on human health. We investigated the relationship between residential street type as a surrogate for traffic intensity and the prevalence of respiratory symptoms, atopic diseases, and allergic sensitization in adults. Data from 6896 subjects of the German Health Survey 1998 with complete information on residential street type were used. Multiple logistic regression analyses were applied to model associations between street type categories, and respiratory and atopic outcomes were assessed by screening questionnaire of The European Respiratory Health Survey and specific IgE measurements. Living at extremely or considerably busy roads (23.9% of total study population) compared to roads with no or rare traffic (64.5%) was statistically significantly associated with chronic bronchitis (aOR 1.36 (95% CI) (1.01-1.83)) while nocturnal coughing attacks (past 12 months) (1.24 (0.98-1.57)), wheeze during the past 12 months (1.21 (0.93-57)), and hay fever (1.16 (0.94-1.42)) were marginally increased after adjustment for several potential confounders and for multiple testing. No increased risks were found for asthma (0.97 (0.67-1.42)) and allergic sensitization (1.05 (0.91-1.20)). We conclude that exposure to traffic-related air pollutants increases the risk of nonallergic respiratory symptoms and to a lesser degree the risk of hay fever and allergic sensitization but not the risk of asthma in adults. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

What is the association between selected comorbidities and obstructive pulmonary disease? Patients and methods: A questionnaire on respiratory symptoms and disease, selected comorbidities, and smoking history was mailed to a cross-sectional, sexand age-stratified, random sample of the population 70 years and older of Bergen, Norway. Results: About 11% of these elderly persons reported having at least one curre obstructive pulmonary disease, 8% reported daily wheezing, and 12% reported significant dyspnea. The only respiratory symptom or disorder to show any clear agerelated pattern was dyspnea, which increased through age 89 before declining. Dyspnea, current asthma, and current chronic bronchitis were about half as likely in males as females, after adjusting for smoking pack-years. Persons with obstructive pulmonary disease reported problems with walking, heart disease, and muscle/joint disease more frequently than those without. Conclusions: The prevalence of respiratory symptoms and obstructive pulmonary disease has been estimated. Only dyspnea was associated with age in this elderly population. Female sex was a predictor of dyspnea, current asthma, and current chronic bronchitis. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {This study was undertaken to determine whether there is an association between air pollutants levels and hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in Taipei, Taiwan. Hospital admissions for CVD and ambient air pollution data for Taipei were obtained for the period 1997-2001. The relative risk of hospital admission was estimated using a case-crossover approach, controlling for weather variables, day of the week, seasonality, and long-term time trends. For the one-pollutant models, on warm days (≥20°C) statistically significant positive associations were found between levels of particulate matter <10-μm aerodynamic diameter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3). On cool days (< 20°C), all pollutants except O3 and SO 2 were significantly associated with CVD admissions. For the two-pollutant models, CO, NO2, and O3 were significant in combination with each of the other four pollutants on warm days. On cool days, PM10 remained statistically significant in all the two-pollutant models. This study provides evidence that higher levels of ambient pollutants increase the risk of hospital admissions for CVD. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The concentration of suspended particulate matters (SPMs) 10 μm or less in diameter were hypothetically converted to PM 2.5 values (converted PM2.5 or cPM2.5) by using a conversion factor obtained from 25 estimates in Japan. Among various causes of death, a significant correlation was observed between both the SPM and cPM2.5 (SPM/cPM2.5) levels and the age-adjusted death rates of ischemic heart disease or hypertensive heart disease in both genders. Correlation was noted with pneumonia, asthma, chronic bronchitis/emphysema, or lung cancer only in females. Unexpectedly, breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer also showed significant increases in mortality rates related to the SPM/cPM2.5 level, suggesting a role for suspended particles in the ambient air with or without gaseous component as a possible endocrine- disrupting, estrogenic agent. Multivariate regression analysis of confounding factors, smoking rate, population density, and hormone-related factors revealed consistent significance of SPM/cPM2.5 in these diseases. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The uptake rate constant of DDT from water decreased with increasing trophic level. The dietary absorption efficiency (AE) of DDT was 10-29% in copepods and 72-99% in fish. Food concentration did not significantly affect the AEs of DDT, but the AEs varied considerably among the different food diets. The elimination rate constants of DDT by the copepods were comparable following uptake from the diet and from the water. Elimination of DDT from the fish was exceedingly low. Both aqueous and dietary uptake are equally important for DDT accumulation in the copepods. In fish, dissolved exposure is a more significant route than intake from the diet. The predicted trophic transfer factors in the copepods and the fish are consistent with the field measurements in marine zooplankton and fish. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Vertical differences in PM10 and PM2.5 suspended particles were investigated using a building in Osaka, Japan. Samples were collected on the roof of the building (200 m above ground level) and on the ground during 5-9 August and 2-6 December 2002. In addition to determination of sample mass, concentrations have been analyzed for major chemical components including elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC). Particle mass concentrations of the samples collected at 200 m were lower than those collected on the ground. "Others" species, defined as the difference between the total particle mass and the sum of the masses of the measured species, dominantly accounted for the vertical difference in mass concentrations in summer, whereas EC and OC were the major contributors in winter. Vertical profiles of relative humidity observed simultaneously indicated that relative humidity on the ground was higher than that at 200 m during the summer sampling period. Hence, it is likely that the higher concentrations of "others" species in the samples collected on the ground were probably caused by water having been absorbed by deliquescent components of the particles. Vertical temperature profiles during the winter sampling period suggested that stable meteorological conditions in winter resulted in the accumulation of primary particles, mainly emitted from vehicle exhaust, leading to the high concentrations of EC and OC on the ground. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {An analysis of PM2.5 mass concentrations and 0.5 μm aerosol optical depths (AODs) during the Northeast winter monsoon seasons of 1996-2000 is performed and intercompared. AODs are found to show diurnal variations over Coastal India (CI) (west coast) while they are relatively smooth over the Arabian Sea (AS) (5-20°N) and tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) (5°N-20°S). PM2.5, PM10 and total mass concentrations show less variations in a day over these oceanic regions. Columnar AODs are found to increase with an increase in the marine boundary layer aerosol concentrations over CI and AS while an opposite trend is seen over TIO. The yearly-mean AODs and mass concentrations are found to increase over CI and AS, over TIO the mass concentrations increased while the AODs decreased during 1996-2000. It is found from the 7-days air back trajectory analyses that at different altitudes air masses can originate from different source regions leading to changes in chemical, physical and optical characteristics of the aerosol between the surface and column. The differences in the surface and columnar measurements could also occur due to changes in the meteorological conditions, wind patterns, in addition to changes in production and subsequently the transport of aerosols. Least-squares fits to the above intercomparison resulted in intercepts of 0.24 and 0.22 over CI and AS indicating that the background AODs over these oceanic regions are higher. An examination of the daily-mean wind speeds and PM2.5 mass concentrations yielded an index of wind dependence of 0.04 for AS and 0.07 for TIO. The background PM 2.5 mass concentrations are also found to be high at 36 and 25 μg m-3 over AS and TIO, respectively, indicating a stronger influence from the continent. Frequency distribution figures show that 28% of the PM 2.5 values over CI lie in the 60-80 μg m-3 range. Over AS the dominant mode of distribution is 40-60 μg m-3 with a peak value of 42%. Over TIO PM2.5 values are found to peak in the lower mass bin of 0-20 μg m-3 at 33%. A latitudinal gradient is seen in the peak bin value of PM2.5 as the ship moves away from the coast. About half the days over CI and 20% over AS and TIO, PM2.5 values are found unhealthy indicating the influence of anthropogenic pollution and long-range transport of pollutants from the surrounding continental locations across these oceanic regimes. AODs are found to peak in the 0.2-0.4 bin at 52% over CI and 47% over AS. Over AS 32% of the AODs are found to be <0.2. More than 90% of AODs over TIO are <0.2. The feature is different when compared to three maritime locations in the Pacific where 75% or more cases have AODs <0.1. α values are found to peak in the 1.5-2 range over CI at 55% while they peak in the lower range of 1-1.5 at 49% and 26% over AS and TIO, respectively. Over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans in more than 90% of the cases α was ≤1.5, indicating that the amount of smaller and larger particles are higher over the Indian Ocean when compared to the Pacific and Atlantic. The spread in PM2.5 and AOD indicates that it is a challenging task to obtain a good relation without additional inputs on the vertical distribution of aerosols as varied kinds of aerosols from different source regions contribute at different heights over these oceanic regions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

With the combination of local meteorological information, including solar radiation, wind direction and speed, the results showed that the concentrations of aromatic compounds and formaldehyde (HCHO) were higher at night while the values of ozone, NO2 and SO2 were high during the day. The major source of aromatics was the aromatic extraction unit in the refinery while NO2 and SO2 were mainly emitted from chimneys with not very high average concentrations. Formaldehyde concentration was above 50 ppbv during night. There exists an apparent correlation between the variation of ground-level ozone concentration and photochemical reactions. The results indicate that in addition to benzene and toluene, ozone is a deleterious pollutant.

A relatively even spatial distribution throughout Beijing and a significant seasonal variation were observed. SO 42-, NO3-, Cl-, NH 4+, Ca2+, and K+ were the major ions and existed mainly in the form of (NH4)2SO4, NH4NO3, NaCl, KCl, and CaCl2 in aerosol particles. Most ions showed high concentrations in winter and low in summer. Secondary ions, mainly SO42-, NO3-, exhibited high concentrations in both summer and winter due to the secondary transformation accelerated under high humidity and strong solar radiation in summer and the higher concentration of SO2 from coal burning and the lower removal rate in winter. The formations of SO42- and NO3- were determined largely by temperature and NH 4+, respectively. Temperature, relative humidity, rainwater frequency, and air mass origin might be the main factors regulating the aerosol distribution. Crustal ions exhibited sporadic but high peaks in spring due to the intrusion of dust from west and northwest of China. The Ca2+/Al ratio was used to indicate the mixing of different dust sources. Factor analysis showed that the secondary formation of coal/biomass burning products, crust, industrial and traffic emissions were the major sources of the fine aerosols in Beijing. Traffic source became more significant with motorization in recent years. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Three sampling locations, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) (control site), Vikas Nagar (VN) (commercial site) and Juhi Colony (JC) (residential site) were selected. Total forty-seven 24-h samples were collected for PM2.5 and PM10 during October 2002-February 2003 at these locations.

PM10 (45-589 μg m-3), PM 2.5 (25-200 μg m-3), BSOF (1-170 μg m-3) and heavy metals were highest at VN followed by JC and IIT. The study concluded that the overall air quality in the city of Kanpur was much inferior to other cities in India and abroad. Similar to PM10 and PM2.5, heavy metals were almost 5-10 times higher than levels in European cities. The study concluded that there was a need to address the issue of PM2.5 monitoring and control. Because regular PM2.5 monitoring may take some time, a linear model for predicting PM2.5 using routinely monitored parameters PM10 and BSOF was suggested for preliminary assessment.

   abstract = {The regional distribution of, and human exposure to, naphthalene are investigated for Southern California. A comprehensive approach is taken in which advanced models are linked for the first time to quantify population exposure to the emissions of naphthalene throughout Southern California. Naphthalene is the simplest and most abundant of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in polluted urban environments, and has been detected in both outdoor and indoor air samples. Exposure to high concentrations of naphthalene may have adverse health effects, possibly causing cancer in humans. Among the significant emission sources are volatilization from naphthalene-containing products, petroleum refining, and combustion of fossil fuels and wood. Gasoline and diesel engine exhaust, with related vaporization from fuels, are found to contribute roughly half of the daily total naphthalene burden in Southern California. As part of this study, the emission inventory for naphthalene has been verified against new field measurements of the naphthalene-to-benzene ratio in a busy traffic tunnel in Los Angeles, supporting the modeling work carried out here. The Surface Meteorology and Ozone Generation (SMOG) airshed model is used to compute the spatial and temporal distributions of naphthalene and its photooxidation products in Southern California. The present simulations reveal a high degree of spatial variability in the concentrations of naphthalene-related species, with large diurnal and seasonal variations as well. Peak naphthalene concentrations are estimated to occur in the early morning hours in the winter season. The naphthalene concentration estimates obtained from the SMOG model are employed in the Regional Human Exposure (REHEX) model to calculate population exposure statistics. Results show average hourly naphthalene exposures in Southern California under summer and winter conditions of 270 and 430 ng m -3, respectively. Exposure to significantly higher concentrations may occur for individuals close to local sources, or in naphthalene "hotspots" revealed by simulations and observations. Such levels of naphthalene exposure may be used to gauge the potential health impacts of long-term naphthalene exposure. Results are also given for the distributions of 1,4-naphthoquinone, a naphthalene reaction product that may have significant health effects. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Trees are effective in the capture of particles from urban air to the extent that they can significantly improve urban air quality. As a result of their aerodynamic properties conifers, with their smaller leaves and more complex shoot structures, have been shown to capture larger amounts of particle matter than broadleaved trees. This study focuses on the effects of particle size on the deposition velocity of particles (Vg) to five urban tree species (coniferous and broadleaved) measured at two field sites, one urban and polluted and a second more rural. The larger uptake to conifers is confirmed, and for broadleaves and conifers Vg values are shown to be greater for ultra-fine particles (Dp < 1.0 μm) than for fine and coarse particles. This is important since finer particles are more likely to be deposited deep in the alveoli of the human lung causing adverse health effects. The finer particle fraction is also shown to be transported further from the emission source; in this study a busy urban road. In further sets of data the aqueous soluble and insoluble fractions of the ultra-fines were separated, indicating that aqueous insoluble particles made up only a small proportion of the ultra-fines. Much of the ultra-fine fraction is present as aerosol. Chemical analysis of the aqueous soluble fractions of coarse, fine and ultra-fine particles showed the importance of nitrates, chloride and phosphates in all three size categories at the polluted and more rural location. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {A model for simulating desert dust cycle was adapted and applied for a dust storm case in the southwest United States (US). This is an initial test of the model's capability as part of a future public health early warning system. The modeled meteorological fields, which drive a dust storm, were evaluated against surface and upper-air measurement data. The modeled dust fields were compared with satellite images, in situ surface PM2.5 and PM10 data, and visibility data in the areas affected by the dust event. The model predicted meteorological fields reasonably well. The modeled surface and upper-air field patterns were in agreement with the measured ones. The vertical profiles of wind, temperature, and humidity followed closely with the observed profiles. Statistical analyses of modeled and observed meteorological variables at surface sites showed fairly good model performance. The modeled dust spatial distributions were comparable with the satellite-observed dust clouds and the reduced visibility patterns. Most encouragingly, the model-predicted and observed PM2.5 peak hours matched reasonably well. The model produced better PM2.5 peak hours than PM10 peak hours. The temporal varying trends of daily and hourly PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations at most of the measurement sites were similar to those observed. Discrepancies between the values of the modeled and the measured surface PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations differed with time and location. Sometimes the modeled and measured concentrations can have one order of magnitude differences. These revealed there were possible deficiencies in the simulation of the dust production strength and location, and the representation of dust particle size in the modeling. Better land surface data and size representation of the dust production are expected to further improve model performance. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {In traditional societies, women are more likely to be adversely affected by exposures to fine particulates from domestic fuel combustion due to their role in the family as the primary cooks. In this study, 24-h gravimetric personal and indoor PM2.5 exposures were measured for 15 women using kerosene and another 15 women using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as their main cooking fuel in Mysore, India. The women also answered a detailed questionnaire regarding their residential housing characteristics, health status, cooking practices and socioeconomic status. Repeated measurements were obtained during two seasons. The main objective of this study was to determine whether exposures to PM 2.5 differed according to fuel usage patterns. A repeated-measures general linear model (GLM) was used to analyze the data. Women using kerosene as their primary cooking fuel had significantly higher exposures. During summer, the arithmetic mean (± standard error) for kerosene users personal exposure was 111±13 and 71±15 μg m-3 for LPG users. Kerosene users had higher exposures in winter (177±21 μg m -3) compared to summer exposures. However, for LPG users there was no difference in their seasonal geometric mean exposures at 71±13 μg m-3. Indoor concentrations followed similar patterns. In summer, kerosene-using households had an arithmetic mean concentration of 98±9 μg m-3 and LPG-using households had an arithmetic mean concentration of 71±9 μg m-3. Winter concentrations were significantly higher than summer concentrations for kerosene users (155±13 μg m-3). Again, LPG users showed only slightly higher indoor concentrations (73±6 μg m-3) than kerosene users. Socioeconomic status, age, season and income were significant predictors of cooking fuel choice. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We present a proof-of-concept analysis of the measurement of the health damage of ozone (O3) produced from nitrogen oxides (NO x=NO+NO2) emitted by individual large point sources in the eastern United States. We use a regional atmospheric model of the eastern United States, the Comprehensive Air quality Model with Extensions (CAMx), to quantify the variable impact that a fixed quantity of NOx emitted from individual sources can have on the downwind concentration of surface O 3, depending on temperature and local biogenic hydrocarbon emissions. We also examine the dependence of resulting O3-related health damages on the size of the exposed population. The investigation is relevant to the increasingly widely used "cap and trade" approach to NO x regulation, which presumes that shifts of emissions over time and space, holding the total fixed over the course of the summer O3 season, will have minimal effect on the environmental outcome. By contrast, we show that a shift of a unit of NOx emissions from one place or time to another could result in large changes in resulting health effects due to O3 formation and exposure. We indicate how the type of modeling carried out here might be used to attach externality-correcting prices to emissions. Charging emitters fees that are commensurate with the damage caused by their NOx emissions would create an incentive for emitters to reduce emissions at times and in locations where they cause the largest damage. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Emissions from power plant pose a potentially large risk to human health and the environment. This pollution source is of particular concern in Mexico, where a large share of electricity is generated by the burning of high-sulfur fuel oil. In this paper, we estimate the health impacts due to air pollution from one of the Mexico's largest power plants, Tuxpan, located on the eastern coast. We calculate the annual average concentrations of primary and secondary (sulfates and nitrates) particulate matter, by modeling representative periods during the year 2001 using the CALPUFF-CALMET modeling system. We find that emissions from the power plant resulted in annual average concentrations of 0.12 μg m-3 (min-max: 0.00-1.43) for primary PM2.5, 0.64 μg m-3 (0.01-2.84) for secondary PM2.5 and 3.09 μg m-3 (0.01-41.54) for SO2 in the 120 km×120 km modeling domain. Such concentrations, while mostly affecting a relatively rural area, could result in significant public health and economic impacts for the local population. It is important to consider such damages when evaluating different electricity generation and control technologies. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {There is increasingly growing evidence linking urban air pollution to acute and chronic illnesses amongst all age groups. Therefore, monitoring of ambient concentrations of various air pollutants as well as quantification of the dose inhaled becomes quite important, specially in view of the fact that in many countries, policy decisions for reducing pollutant concentrations are mainly taken on the basis of their health impacts. The dose when gets combined with the likely responses, indicates the ultimate health risk (HR). Thus, as an extension of our earlier studies, HR has been estimated for three pollutants, namely, suspended particulate matter (SPM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) for Delhi City in India. For estimation and analyses, three zones have been considered, namely, residential, industrial and commercial. The total population has been divided into three age classes (infants, children and adults) with different body weights and breathing rates. The exercise takes into account age-specific breathing rates, body weights for different age categories and occupancy factors for different zones. Results indicate that health risks due to air pollution in Delhi are highest for children. For all age categories, health risks due to SO2 (HR_SO 2) are the lowest. Hence, HR_SO2 has been taken as the reference with respect to which HR values due to SPM and NO2 have been compared. Taking into account all the age categories and their occupancy in different zones, average HR values for NO2 and SPM turn out to be respectively 22.11 and 16.13 times more than that for SO2. The present study can be useful in generating public awareness as well as in averting and mitigating the health risks. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of fungal fragments and to estimate their respiratory deposition. Fragments and spores of three different fungal species (Aspergillus versicolor, Penicillium melinii, and Stachybotrys chartarum) were aerosolized by the fungal spore source strength tester (FSSST). An electrical low-pressure impactor (ELPI) measured the size distribution in real-time and collected the aerosolized fungal particles simultaneously onto 12 impactor stages in the size range of 0.3-10 μm utilizing water-soluble ZEF-X10 coating of the impaction stages to prevent spore bounce. For S. chartarum, the average concentration of released fungal fragments was 380 particles cm-3, which was about 514 times higher than that of spores. A. versicolor was found to release comparable amount of spores and fragments. Microscopic analysis confirmed that S. chartarum and A. versicolor did not show any significant spore bounce, whereas the size distribution of P. melinii fragments was masked by spore bounce. Respiratory deposition was calculated using a computer-based model, LUDEP 2.07, for an adult male and a 3-month-old infant utilizing the database on the concentration and size distribution of S. chartarum and A. versicolor aerosols measured by the ELPI. Total deposition fractions for fragments and spores were 27-46% and 84-95%, respectively, showing slightly higher values in an infant than in an adult. For S. chartarum, fragments demonstrated 230-250 fold higher respiratory deposition than spores, while the number of deposited fragments and spores of A. versicolor were comparable. It was revealed that the deposition ratio (the number of deposited fragments divided by that of deposited spores) in the lower airways for an infant was 4-5 times higher than that for an adult. As fungal fragments have been shown to contain mycotoxins and antigens, further exposure assessment should include the measurement of fungal fragments for evaluating mold exposures in damp buildings. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Epidemiological studies typically utilise one or few central monitoring stations as a proxy for personal exposure to particulate matter air pollution. However, recent research indicates that central monitoring sites may not accurately characterize the spatial complexities of the particulate field across an urban area. Consequently, intraurban assessment of exposure to air pollution has become a priority area of study. This paper reviews particulate air pollution exposure studies with a focus on monitored-data studies at the intraurban spatial scale. Portions of the literature provide contradictory conclusions as to the homogeneity of intraurban particulate concentrations, due in part to local conditions such as source composition, meteorology, locations of monitoring sites and topography, but which may also be a result of the methods and definitions used to quantify relative and absolute spatial concentration variations. Comparative analyses of the literature by particle size fraction, method of determining heterogeneity, and sampling characteristics were performed. We find that particular attention should be given to local conditions and methods when using one or few monitoring sites to characterise wider population exposures. The utilisation of absolute and relative measures of homogeneity such as the coefficient of divergence which are based on data from several monitoring sites (e.g., n>4) in combination with an appropriate sample size (e.g., n≥50) may reduce the possibility of misclassification based on incorrect assumptions about heterogeneity. The errors in exposure misclassification based on these assumptions about intraurban concentration variations are especially critical in long-term cohort epidemiological analyses that assess the effects of exposure variations in air pollution upon health. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Dust-loaded tree leaves from Kathmandu have been analyzed for magnetic susceptibility (χ) and heavy metal (HM) contents. For 221 samples of leaves of cypress (mainly Cupressus corneyana), silky oak (Grevillea robusta) and bottlebrush (Callistemon lanceolatus), χ has a range of (0.01-54) ×10-8 m3 kg-1 with a median of about 10.0×10-8 m3 kg-1. Trees situated close to the busy road intersections, near the main bus station and sectors of roads with steep slope yield elevated susceptibility. Chemical analysis of 20 samples of varying susceptibility by atomic absorption spectrometry yields the following maximum HM contents: Fe (1.3 wt%), Mn (281.9 ppm), Zn (195.2 ppm), Cu (41.5 ppm), Pb (38.4 ppm), Ni (8.1 ppm), Cr (6.4 ppm), Co (4.1 ppm) and Cd (1.2 ppm). The logarithmic susceptibility on dry mass basis (χd) shows significant linear relationship with HM contents: Pearson's correlation coefficient r>0.8 with Zn, Fe, Cr; r>0.7 with Mn, Cu; r>0.6 with Pb, Ni. Magnetic phases are of soft (magnetite/maghemite) and hard (hematite) coercivities. Microscopy of magnetic extracts reveals spherules (mostly of 2-20 μm diameter) originated from vehicle exhausts through the combustion process as well as crystalline grains of lithogenic origin. The dust accumulation in leaves took place mainly after monsoon (beginning of October 2001) till the sampling period (first half of February 2002). Despite the dependence of susceptibility and HM contents on a variety of spatial and temporal factors (amount of particulate matter (PM), efficiency of deposition/removal of PM by wind, precipitation, birds etc.), a significant correlation of susceptibility to HM implies that the former serves as an effective proxy of metallic pollution. Hence, susceptibility-based bio-monitoring technique is recommended as an economic and rapid tool for assessment of environmental pollution in urban areas like Kathmandu. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Pollutants emitted to the atmosphere in the course of cement production were modeled. The ISC3-ST model was applied to estimate air dispersion of the contaminants emitted by the cement plant. Air concentrations of NO2, SO2, PM10, metals, and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), as well as the potential exposure in the vicinity of the facility, were assessed via models based on US EPA guidance documents. PCDD/F and metal concentrations were also modeled for soil and vegetation. Based on these concentrations, the levels of human exposure were calculated. Individual cancer and noncancer risks for the emissions of the cement kiln were assessed. Health effects due to NO2, SO2, and PM10 emissions were also evaluated. Risk assessment was performed as a deterministic analysis. The main individual risk in the population was evaluated in a central-tendency and a high-end approach. The results show that the incremental individual risk due to emissions of the cement plant is very low not only with regard to health effects, but also in relation to toxicological and cancer risks produced by pollutants such as metals and PCDD/Fs emitted by the cement kiln. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Many studies have shown a positive association between ambient ozone levels and mortality. Typically, these findings are based on models that assume a linear relationship between log mortality and ozone level. In this study, we adapted generalized additive models in which ozone effects are presumed to occur in three different ways: as a simple linear term, as a cubic natural spline term, and as a combination of two linear terms (a threshold model). We applied these models to daily time-series data for Seoul, Korea for the years 1995-1999 and found that the threshold model always fits best among the three. A 2.6% (95% CI: 1.7-3.5) increase of estimated relative risk (RR) in the total mortality associated with a 21.5ppb increase of daily 1-h maximum ozone lagged by 1 day was observed by linear Poisson's regression. However, a 3.4% (95% CI: 2.3-4.4) increase in the estimated RR was observed using the threshold model. Adjustments for other ambient pollutants caused little changes to these results; 2.4-2.5% in the linear models and 3.2-3.4% in the threshold models. In addition, the largest difference in the estimated RRs of the linear and threshold models was observed in the summer: 1.9% (95% CI: 0.5-3.3) by the linear model and 3.8% (95% CI: 2.0-5.7) by the threshold model. These findings indicate that the conventional time-series Poisson regression model, which dose not take threshold into consideration, could underestimate the true risk of the ozone effect on daily mortality. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Building occupants, including cleaning personnel, are exposed to a wide variety of airborne chemicals when cleaning agents and air fresheners are used in buildings. Certain of these chemicals are listed by the state of California as toxic air contaminants (TACs) and a subset of these are regulated by the US federal government as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). California's Proposition 65 list of species recognized as carcinogens or reproductive toxicants also includes constituents of certain cleaning products and air fresheners. In addition, many cleaning agents and air fresheners contain chemicals that can react with other air contaminants to yield potentially harmful secondary products. For example, terpenes can react rapidly with ozone in indoor air generating many secondary pollutants, including TACs such as formaldehyde. Furthermore, ozone-terpene reactions produce the hydroxyl radical, which reacts rapidly with organics, leading to the formation of other potentially toxic air pollutants. Indoor reactive chemistry involving the nitrate radical and cleaning-product constituents is also of concern, since it produces organic nitrates as well as some of the same oxidation products generated by ozone and hydroxyl radicals. Few studies have directly addressed the indoor concentrations of TACs that might result from primary emissions or secondary pollutant formation following the use of cleaning agents and air fresheners. In this paper, we combine direct empirical evidence with the basic principles of indoor pollutant behavior and with information from relevant studies, to analyze and critically assess air pollutant exposures resulting from the use of cleaning products and air fresheners. Attention is focused on compounds that are listed as HAPs, TACs or Proposition 65 carcinogens/reproductive toxicants and compounds that can readily react to generate secondary pollutants. The toxicity of many of these secondary pollutants has yet to be evaluated. The inhalation intake of airborne organic compounds from cleaning product use is estimated to be of the order of 10mgd-1person-1 in California. More than two dozen research articles present evidence of adverse health effects from inhalation exposure associated with cleaning or cleaning products. Exposure to primary and secondary pollutants depends on the complex interplay of many sets of factors and processes, including cleaning product composition, usage, building occupancy, emission dynamics, transport and mixing, building ventilation, sorptive interactions with building surfaces, and reactive chemistry. Current understanding is sufficient to describe the influence of these variables qualitatively in most cases and quantitatively in a few. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

At four different sites in Austria (3 urban and one rural site) an extended monitoring program was conducted for PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 as well as particle number concentration for 12 months each. Beside continuous measurements using TEOM and beta attenuation high-volume sampling of PM2.5 and PM10 provided samples for chemical analyses of various ions, heavy metals and organic compounds. Furthermore, carbonaceous material (TC, EC, OC) year round and PAHs on selected days were analyzed. From collocated public monitoring stations also pollutant gases (SO2, NO, NO2, O3, CO) and meteorological components are available. In winter and summer campaigns aerosol size spectra including chemical components were measured for at least one week each. All data are collected in a project data base (CD-ROM). While extensive data analysis will be presented in following papers, some general results are presented within this paper: annual averages for PM1 are between 10 and 20μgm -3, for PM2.5 between 15 and 26mgm-3 and for PM10 between 20 and 38μgm-3. Number concentrations are between 10,000 and 30,000cm-3. Urban concentrations are usually higher in winter, rural concentrations in summer. PM2.5 is in average around 70% of PM10, for PM1 this fraction is about 57%. Several studies on health effects are included in this project: a cross-sectional study on preschool and school children regarding lung function measurements and questionnaires about respiratory impairment in the surrounding area of the monitoring sites as well as time series studies on mortality and respiratory morbidity on the general population. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that ambient air pollution in relation to various energy scenarios could have significant impact on the health status of Shanghai residents. Compared with base case scenario, implementation of various energy scenarios could prevent 608-5144 and 1189-10,462 PM10-related avoidable deaths (mid-value) in 2010 and 2020, respectively; and it could also decrease substantial cases of relevant diseases.

The objective of this study was to assess the possible effects of Asian dust storms on the mortality of residents in Taipei, Taiwan, during the period from 1995 to 2000. We identified 39 dust storm episodes, which were classified as index days. Daily deaths on the index days were compared with deaths on the comparison days. We selected two comparison days for each index day, 7 days before the index day and 7 days after the index day. The strongest estimated effects of dust storms were increases of 7.66% in risk for respiratory disease 1 day after the event, 4.92% for total deaths 2 days following the dust storms and 2.59% for circulatory diseases 2 days following the dust storms. However, none of these effects were statistically significant. This study found greater specificity for associations with respiratory deaths, and this increases the likelihood that the association between dust events and daily mortality represents a causal relationship. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Particle surrogates (PS), such as residual oil fly ash (ROFA), have been widely used in experimental studies aimed at characterizing the mechanisms of particle toxicity. Since PS composition varies depending on its source, studies with different types of PS may provide clues about the relative toxicity of the components generated by high-temperature combustion process. In this work, we have studied the effects of nasal instillation of increasing doses of different PS in mice: saline, carbon, and two types of particle surrogates. PS type A (PSA) was the ROFA collected from the waste incinerator of our university hospital; PS type B (PSB) was collected from the electrostatic precipitator of a large steel company and thus had an elevated metal content. After 24h, we analyzed hematological parameters, fibrinogen, bronchoalveolar lavage, bone marrow, and pulmonary histology. Nasal instillation of the two types of PS-induced leucopenia. PSB elicited a greater elevation of plasma fibrinogen levels. Bone marrow and pulmonary inflammatory changes were more intense for PSA. We concluded that the PS composition modulates acute inflammatory changes more significantly than the mass for these two types of PS. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The present investigation was aimed to further characterise the epithelial response to DE in vivo, with particular reference to possible TH2 response, in non-atopic healthy subjects. To determine this response, 15 healthy, non-atopic non-smoking subjects with normal lung function were exposed to DE (PM10 300 μg/m3) and filtered air during 1 h on two separate randomised occasions. Bronchoscopy sampling of bronchial mucosal biopsies was performed 6 h after exposure. Immunohistochemical staining were performed using mAb for IL-10, IL-13 and IL-18 expression. DE exposure induced a significant increase in the expression of IL-13 in the bronchial epithelium cells, 2.1 (1.35-4.88) Md (Q1-Q3) vs. air 0.94 (0.53-1.23); P=0.009.

Design: An ecological time-series analysis was performed for a period of 2 years (July 1998-June 2000). Generalized additive model yields to relative risks and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimates were also carried out. Main results: The 10-day cumulative effect of a 10-μg/m3 black smoke increase was significantly associated with a 6.2% (95% CI, 2.4-10.1%) increase in the sales of anti-asthmatics and bronchodilators and to a 9.2% (95% CI, 5.9-12.6%) increase in the sales of cough and cold preparation for children aged under 15 years. The cumulative effect of a 10-μg/m3 increase in SO2 was associated with an 11.8% (95% CI, 6.7-17.1%) increase in cough and cold preparation sales for children aged under 15 years. The cumulative effect of 10-μg/m3 increase in NO2 was associated with an 13.6% (95% CI, 8-18.3%) increase in cough and cold preparation sales for children under 15 years of age. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that an increase in drugs sales was directly related to air pollutant concentration increases in the city of Rouen (France). © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {To examine hypotheses regarding health effects of particulate matter, we conducted time series studies in Austrian urban and rural areas. Of the pollutants measured, ambient PM2.5 was most consistently associated with parameters of respiratory health. Time series studies applying semiparametric generalized additive models showed significant increases of respiratory hospital admissions (ICD 490-496) at age 65 and older. The early increase of 5.5% in Vienna at a lag of 2 days in males and of 5.6% per 10μg/m3 at a lag of 3 days in females was not observed in a nearby rural area. Another increase of respiratory admissions (mainly COPD) was observed after a lag of 10-11 days. A time series on a panel of 56 healthy preschool children showed a significant impact of the carbonaceous fraction of PM2.5 on tidal breathing pattern assessed by inductive plethysmography. In repeated oscillometric measurements of respiratory resistance in 164 healthy elementary school children not only immediate responses to fine particulates were found but also latent ones, possibly indicating inflammatory changes in airways. It may be speculated that the improvements of urban air quality prevented measurable effects on respiratory mortality. More sensitive indicators, however, still show acute impairments of respiratory function and health in elderly and children which are associated with fine particulates and subfractions related to motor traffic. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Particulate matter (PM), a component of urban air pollution that derives primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, is responsible for a number of health effects in humans. Recent studies have demonstrated that the fine particles (PM2.5) present in high numbers in PM samples can be more harmful than larger particles, since they are more efficiently retained in the peripheral lung. In the present study, we have investigated the biological effects of PM2.5 on human lung epithelial cell line A549. Morphological analysis performed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy showed that fine particles interact with the cell surface, where they induce evident alterations and, subsequently, are internalized in the cytoplasm. Cytoskeletal components, in particular microfilaments and microtubules, cause modifications upon challenge with PM2.5. Of interest, an early cell response to the fine particulate is an increase of reactive oxygen species content, which can account for the observed cytoskeletal changes and the production of proinflammatory cytokines in A549 cells. In particular, exposure to PM2.5 promoted a dose- and time-dependent release of TNF-α and IL-6 in the cell medium. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Background. Lack of an association between area-based socioeconomic status (SES) and readmission for asthma was investigated in a country with a universal health care system. Methods. Data linkage analysis was conducted based on hospitalization data from Statistics Canada's Person-oriented Information Database and area-based SES data from the 1996 Census. Hospital records for 8333 asthma patients aged 20-64 years in all Canadian provinces except Québec who were admitted in 1995/1996 were linked to determine the number of patients who were rehospitalized within the same fiscal year. The area-based SES of the patients was defined according to the average personal. income and proportion of residents with a university degree in an enumeration area (EA). Incidence rates of readmission for asthma were calculated based on the total years at risk. Cox's proportional hazard model was used to adjust for age, sex, province, and length of stay for first admission. Results. The incidence rate of asthma rehospitalization was 31.6 per 100 person-years for men and 37.2 per 100 person-years for women. Neither average EA income or education level was significantly associated with rehospitalization for asthma. Women living in poor areas tended to have an increased incidence of asthma rehospitalization, but the difference was not significant after adjustment for covariates; using the Cox regression model. Conclusion. Socioeconomic status measured at the neighborhood level has no significant impact on rehospitalization for asthma among Canadian adults. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Studies over the past few decades have showed a clear association between cigarette smoking and the development of chronic airway obstruction. Yet, only a minority of smokers is affected so that in many, even heavy, smokers, pulmonary function remains within normal limits. While carcinogens have been well characterized, there is only limited information about the constituents of cigarette smoke responsible for inducing chronic airway obstruction. In addition, the associated risks factors for airway obstruction in smokers have not been totally identified. The present paper is a review of the recently accumulated facts concerning the intimate action of cigarette smoke at the level of large and small airways and lung parenchyma. The role of classical inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and alveolar macrophages is reviewed, but emphasis is put on recent evidence indicating the involvement of CD8+ T-lymphocytes and possibly eosinophils in the genesis of the structural changes leading to airways obstruction. The mechanisms by which airway inflammation and remodelling cause airway narrowing and airflow limitation are discussed, along with the associated loss of lung elasticity secondary to destructive emphysema. Other biological, epidemiological, physiopathological, and clinical aspects are analyzed, stressing such fundamental aspects as the defence mechanisms, the morpho-functional correlations, the identification of susceptible smokers, and the early detection of airway obstruction, both in specialized laboratories and in primary care. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the effect of high intensity physical group training in water and on land for patients with COPD with regard to physical capacity and health related quality of life (HRQoL). A controlled, semi-randomised study was conducted where 30 patients were randomised to training either in water or on land. Thirteen patients constituted a control group. Forty-three outpatients, with moderate to severe COPD (27w/16m), from two local hospitals in northern Sweden, were included in the study. High intensity physical group training in water (water group) or on land (land group) was performed for 12 weeks, three times per week, 45 min per session. The control group received no intervention. Pre- and post-intervention, all patients performed incremental and endurance shuttle walking tests (ISWT and ESWT), cycle ergometer tests and responded questionnaires about HRQoL (St. Georges Respiratory Questionnaire - SGRQ and SF-36). The patients trained with a mean heart rate of 80-90% of peak heart rate. Both training groups increased the distance walked, i.e. land group in ISWT (25m) and water group in ESWT (179 m). The water group increased the distance in ESWT significantly more that both the land and the control groups. Both training groups increased the time cycled (40-85s) and work load (10-20W) in the cycle ergometer test. The control group deteriorated in HRQoL according to total score in SGRQ while the training groups remained constant. The water group improved their activity score in SGRQ and their physical health score in SF-36 and those improvements were significant as compared to the land and the control groups. In conclusion, high intensity physical group training in water is of benefit for patients with COPD. It was in some areas found to be even more effective regarding improvements in physical capacity and experienced physical health compared to the same kind of training on land. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Pollutants emitted to the atmosphere in the course of cement production were modeled. The ISC3-ST model was applied to estimate air dispersion of the contaminants emitted by the cement plant. Air concentrations of NO2, SO2, PM10, metals, and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), as well as the potential exposure in the vicinity of the facility, were assessed via models based on US EPA guidance documents. PCDD/F and metal concentrations were also modeled for soil and vegetation. Based on these concentrations, the levels of human exposure were calculated. Individual cancer and noncancer risks for the emissions of the cement kiln were assessed. Health effects due to NO2, SO2, and PM10 emissions were also evaluated. Risk assessment was performed as a deterministic analysis. The main individual risk in the population was evaluated in a central-tendency and a high-end approach. The results show that the incremental individual risk due to emissions of the cement plant is very low not only with regard to health effects, but also in relation to toxicological and cancer risks produced by pollutants such as metals and PCDD/Fs emitted by the cement kiln. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {Several epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated significant associations between ambient levels of particulate matter and lung injury and cardiovascular events with increased morbidity and mortality. Particle surrogates (PS), such as residual oil fly ash (ROFA), have been widely used in experimental studies aimed at characterizing the mechanisms of particle toxicity. Since PS composition varies depending on its source, studies with different types of PS may provide clues about the relative toxicity of the components generated by high-temperature combustion process. In this work, we have studied the effects of nasal instillation of increasing doses of different PS in mice: saline, carbon, and two types of particle surrogates. PS type A (PSA) was the ROFA collected from the waste incinerator of our university hospital; PS type B (PSB) was collected from the electrostatic precipitator of a large steel company and thus had an elevated metal content. After 24h, we analyzed hematological parameters, fibrinogen, bronchoalveolar lavage, bone marrow, and pulmonary histology. Nasal instillation of the two types of PS-induced leucopenia. PSB elicited a greater elevation of plasma fibrinogen levels. Bone marrow and pulmonary inflammatory changes were more intense for PSA. We concluded that the PS composition modulates acute inflammatory changes more significantly than the mass for these two types of PS. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The aims of this study were to use a portable CO monitor to compare the exhaled CO levels in established smokers and non-smokers. The exhaled CO levels were measured in 322 subjects (243 healthy smokers, 55 healthy non-smokers, 24 passive smokers) who applied to healthy stand during the spring student activity of Firat University in Elaziǧ. Exhaled CO concentration was measured using the EC50 Smokerlyser. The mean exhaled CO level was 17.132+8.50 parts per million (ppm) for healthy smokers and 3.61±2.15 ppm for healthy non-smokers, and 5.20±3.38 ppm for passive smokers. There were significant positive correlation between CO levels and daily cigarette consumption, and CO levels and duration of smoking in healthy smokers (r = +0.550, P< 0.001, r = +0.265, P<0.001, respectively.

   abstract = {Many studies have shown a positive association between ambient ozone levels and mortality. Typically, these findings are based on models that assume a linear relationship between log mortality and ozone level. In this study, we adapted generalized additive models in which ozone effects are presumed to occur in three different ways: as a simple linear term, as a cubic natural spline term, and as a combination of two linear terms (a threshold model). We applied these models to daily time-series data for Seoul, Korea for the years 1995-1999 and found that the threshold model always fits best among the three. A 2.6% (95% CI: 1.7-3.5) increase of estimated relative risk (RR) in the total mortality associated with a 21.5ppb increase of daily 1-h maximum ozone lagged by 1 day was observed by linear Poisson's regression. However, a 3.4% (95% CI: 2.3-4.4) increase in the estimated RR was observed using the threshold model. Adjustments for other ambient pollutants caused little changes to these results; 2.4-2.5% in the linear models and 3.2-3.4% in the threshold models. In addition, the largest difference in the estimated RRs of the linear and threshold models was observed in the summer: 1.9% (95% CI: 0.5-3.3) by the linear model and 3.8% (95% CI: 2.0-5.7) by the threshold model. These findings indicate that the conventional time-series Poisson regression model, which dose not take threshold into consideration, could underestimate the true risk of the ozone effect on daily mortality. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {In May 2000, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry of the US government conducted a health investigation in response to community concerns regarding ambient and indoor hydrogen sulfide (H2S), odor, and health symptoms in Dakota City, Nebraska. The objective was to determine whether adult residents in an area with repeated exposure to H2S showed poorer performance on neurobehavioral tests than unexposed residents. Study participants were required to meet age (≥16 years of age) and length of residency (2 years) eligibility requirements. A battery of computer-assisted standardized neurobehavioral tests was administered in English or Spanish. A questionnaire was used to collect information about participants, demographic and health status. Three hundred forty-five people agreed to participate. After the exclusion of 10 persons, analyses were conducted on 335 participants; 171 residents in the target area and 164 residents in the comparison area. The two groups were comparable in demographic characteristics and various health conditions. Overall, neurobehavioral test results for the target and comparison groups were similar. Residence in the H2S-exposed area was associated with marginally poorer performance on a test of memory, namely, match to sample score, and a test of grip strength. However, these differences were not significant. Deficits in overall neurobehavioral performance were not associated with exposure to H2S in this study. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

SO 2 at different concentrations (22, 56, and 112 mg/m 3) was administered to animals of SO 2 groups in different exposure chambers for 6 h/day for 7 days, while control groups were exposed to filtered air under the same conditions. Our results show that SO 2 caused lipid peroxidation and changes in antioxidative status in testicles of mice. Exposure to SO 2 at all concentrations tested significantly increased TBARS levels in testicles of mice. SO 2 at all concentrations tested tended to decrease activities of SOD and GPx enzymes and levels of GSH relative to control animals, but only the decreases in SOD and GPx activities caused by SO 2 exposures of higher concentrations were statistically significant. SO 2 at all concentrations tested tended to increase activities of CAT relative to control animals, but the increases of CAT activities caused by SO 2 exposures of low concentrations (22 and 56 mg/m 3) were statistically significant. These results lead to the conclusion that SO 2 exposure can cause oxidative damage to testicles of male mice, and SO 2 is a toxin to the reproductive system of mammals, not only to the respiratory system. Further work is required to understand the toxicological role of SO 2 in reproduction organs or even sperm from humans and animals. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Indoor and outdoor concentrations of formaldehyde (HCHO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and selected chlorinated volatile organic compounds (chlorinated VOC) were measured in 37 urban dwellings in Nagoya, Japan, and 27 urban dwellings in Uppsala, Sweden, using the same sampling procedures and analytical methods. Indoor as well as outdoor air concentrations of HCHO, NO2, and chlorinated VOC were significantly higher in Nagoya than in Uppsala (P<0.01), with the exception of tetrachlorocarbon in outdoor air. In Nagoya, HCHO and NO2 concentrations were significantly higher in modern concrete houses than in wooden houses and higher in newer (less than 10 years) than in older dwellings (P<0.01), possibly due to less natural ventilation and more emission sources in modern buildings. Dwellings heated with unvented combustion sources had significantly higher indoor concentrations of NO2 than those with clean heating (P<0.05). Moreover, dwellings with moth repellents containing p-dichlorobenzene had significantly higher indoor concentrations of p-dichlorobenzene (P<0.01). In conclusion, there appear to be differences between Nagoya and Uppsala with respect to both indoor and outdoor pollution levels of the measured pollutants. More indoor pollution sources could be identified in Nagoya than in Uppsala, including construction and interior materials emitting VOC, use of unvented combustion space heaters, and moth repellents containing p-dichlorobenzene. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

We examined seasonal and temporal trends in pediatric asthma ED (1997-1999) and hospital (1986-1999) admission data so as to identify periods of increased risk of urgent care by age group, gender, and race. All pediatric ED and hospital admission data for Maryland residents occurring within the state of Maryland were evaluated. Distinct peaks in pediatric ED and hospital asthma admissions occurred each year during the winter-spring and autumn seasons. Although the number and timing of these peaks were consistent across age and racial groups, the magnitude of the peaks differed by age and race. The same number, timing, and relative magnitude of the major peaks in asthma admissions occurred statewide, implying that the variables affecting these seasonal patterns of acute asthma exacerbations occur statewide. Similar gross seasonal trends are observed worldwide. Although several environmental, infectious, and psychosocial factors have been linked with increases in asthma exacerbations among children, thus far they have not explained these seasonal patterns of admissions. The striking temporal patterns of pediatric asthma admissions within Maryland, as described here, provide valuable information in the search for causes.},

DE exposure has been shown to induce a pronounced inflammatory response in the airways, with an enhanced epithelial expression of IL-8, and Gro- α in healthy subjects. The present investigation was aimed to further characterise the epithelial response to DE in vivo, with particular reference to possible TH2 response, in non-atopic healthy subjects. To determine this response, 15 healthy, non-atopic non-smoking subjects with normal lung function were exposed to DE (PM10 300 μg/m3) and filtered air during 1 h on two separate randomised occasions. Bronchoscopy sampling of bronchial mucosal biopsies was performed 6 h after exposure. Immunohistochemical staining were performed using mAb for IL-10, IL-13 and IL-18 expression. DE exposure induced a significant increase in the expression of IL-13 in the bronchial epithelium cells, 2.1 (1.35-4.88) Md (Q1-Q3) vs. air 0.94 (0.53-1.23); P=0.009.

   abstract = {The objective of this study was to describe the health status of people living in the slums of Nairobi. It was designed as a cross-sectional study based on data from visitors at a clinic at Trnava University located in Mukuru slum in Nairobi. There were about 16,000 visits registered at Mary Immaculate Clinic of Trnava University in Nairobi during 2 years of operation. A random 5% sample was drawn from the paper-card database of this clinic to assess basic characteristics and health complaints of visitors. Both self-reported health complaints and diagnoses written by physicians were used to assess health status of participants. More females with average age (by slum) ranging from 20.46 to 21.30 years than males with average age ranging from (by slum) 15.86 to 19.49 years are the visitors of the clinic. The major self-reported health complaints of visitors were cough, abdominal pain, and headache for both sexes. The most frequent diagnoses were consequently virosis, acute respiratory infections, and bronchitis. Differences in health complaints by slums were observed and are described herein. The major health complaints and diagnoses in addition to the differences in health complaints and diagnoses by slum show that environmental conditions can have major influences on health status. Therefore, environmental improvements are important in the improvement of health status. A very high prevalence of respiratory complaints and gastrointestinal problems signify that improvements in air pollution reduction, drinking water provision, and waste management in slums can lead to more significant and sustainable improvements in health status than just simple treatment. This fact should be taken into account when planning future relief programs. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Design: An ecological time-series analysis was performed for a period of 2 years (July 1998-June 2000). Generalized additive model yields to relative risks and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimates were also carried out. Main results: The 10-day cumulative effect of a 10-μg/m3 black smoke increase was significantly associated with a 6.2% (95% CI, 2.4-10.1%) increase in the sales of anti-asthmatics and bronchodilators and to a 9.2% (95% CI, 5.9-12.6%) increase in the sales of cough and cold preparation for children aged under 15 years. The cumulative effect of a 10-μg/m3 increase in SO2 was associated with an 11.8% (95% CI, 6.7-17.1%) increase in cough and cold preparation sales for children aged under 15 years. The cumulative effect of 10-μg/m3 increase in NO2 was associated with an 13.6% (95% CI, 8-18.3%) increase in cough and cold preparation sales for children under 15 years of age.

   abstract = {The 'road-to-ambient' evolution of particle number distributions near the 405 and 710 freeways in Los Angeles, California, in both summer and winter, were analyzed and then simulated by a multi-component sectional aerosol dynamic model. Condensation/evaporation and dilution were demonstrated to be the major mechanisms in altering aerosol size distribution, while coagulation and deposition play minor roles. Seasonal effects were significant with winters generally less dynamic than summers. A large number of particles grew into the >10 nm range around 30-90 m downwind of the freeways. Beyond 90 m some shrink to <10 nm range and some continued growing to >100 nm as a result of competition between partial pressure and vapor pressure. Particle compositions probably change dramatically as components adapt to decreasing gas-phase concentration due to dilution, so number distribution evolution is also an evolution of composition. As a result, people who live within about 90 m of roadways are exposed to particle sizes and compositions that others are not. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Building occupants, including cleaning personnel, are exposed to a wide variety of airborne chemicals when cleaning agents and air fresheners are used in buildings. Certain of these chemicals are listed by the state of California as toxic air contaminants (TACs) and a subset of these are regulated by the US federal government as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). California's Proposition 65 list of species recognized as carcinogens or reproductive toxicants also includes constituents of certain cleaning products and air fresheners. In addition, many cleaning agents and air fresheners contain chemicals that can react with other air contaminants to yield potentially harmful secondary products. For example, terpenes can react rapidly with ozone in indoor air generating many secondary pollutants, including TACs such as formaldehyde. Furthermore, ozone-terpene reactions produce the hydroxyl radical, which reacts rapidly with organics, leading to the formation of other potentially toxic air pollutants. Indoor reactive chemistry involving the nitrate radical and cleaning-product constituents is also of concern, since it produces organic nitrates as well as some of the same oxidation products generated by ozone and hydroxyl radicals. Few studies have directly addressed the indoor concentrations of TACs that might result from primary emissions or secondary pollutant formation following the use of cleaning agents and air fresheners. In this paper, we combine direct empirical evidence with the basic principles of indoor pollutant behavior and with information from relevant studies, to analyze and critically assess air pollutant exposures resulting from the use of cleaning products and air fresheners. Attention is focused on compounds that are listed as HAPs, TACs or Proposition 65 carcinogens/reproductive toxicants and compounds that can readily react to generate secondary pollutants. The toxicity of many of these secondary pollutants has yet to be evaluated. The inhalation intake of airborne organic compounds from cleaning product use is estimated to be of the order of 10mgd-1person-1 in California. More than two dozen research articles present evidence of adverse health effects from inhalation exposure associated with cleaning or cleaning products. Exposure to primary and secondary pollutants depends on the complex interplay of many sets of factors and processes, including cleaning product composition, usage, building occupancy, emission dynamics, transport and mixing, building ventilation, sorptive interactions with building surfaces, and reactive chemistry. Current understanding is sufficient to describe the influence of these variables qualitatively in most cases and quantitatively in a few. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

PM2.5 samples were collected at five sites of Beijing during summers and winters of 2001 and 2002 and spring of 2003. Daily average 10.7±3.6 and 5.7±2.9μgm-3 in summer and 36.7±19.4 and 15.2±11.1μgm-3 in winter of 2002 for OC and EC, respectively, were observed in Beijing urban area. The concentrations of carbonaceous species contributed 18.4±3.5% and 37.2±12.7% of PM2.5 in summer and winter, respectively, of which OC accounted for 70% or more of the total carbon (TC). OC and EC concentrations and their mass percentages in PM2.5 were higher in winter than in summer, which could be attributed to the coal consumption of heating period. Organic aerosols would constitute up to 42% of PM2.5 in winter based on the evaluation of 1.6 for the ratio of OC to organic particulates. Secondary organic carbon (SOC) were estimated to be more than 50% and up to 95% of total OC in summer based on the minimum OC/EC ratio of 0.9. Comparisons of OC and EC with trace elements, As, Zn, K and Pb, at various sites demonstrated that coal combustion was a dominant source of carbonaceous species of PM2.5 in the urban area of Beijing during winter, and biomass burning, traffic and/or industry emission were the major sources of OC and EC in the summer. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {This paper synthesizes data on aerosol (particulate matter, PM) physical characteristics, which were obtained in European aerosol research activities at free-troposphere, natural, rural, near-city, urban, and kerbside sites over the past decade. It covers only two sites in the semi-arid Mediterranean area, and lacks data from Eastern Europe. The data include PM10 and/or PM2.5 mass concentrations, and aerosol particle size distributions. Such data sets are more comprehensive than those currently provided by air quality monitoring networks (e.g. EMEP, EUROAIRNET). Data available from 31 sites in Europe (called "The Network") were reviewed. They were processed and plotted to allow comparisons in spite of differences in the sampling and analytical techniques used in various studies. A number of conclusions are drawn as follows: Background annual average PM10 and PM2.5 mass concentrations for continental Europe are 7.0±4.1 and 4.8±2.4μgm-3, respectively. The EU 2005 annual average PM10 standard of 40μgm-3 is exceeded at a few sites in The Network. At all near city, urban and kerbside sites, the EU 2010 annual average PM10 standard of 20μgm-3, as well as the US-EPA annual average PM2.5 standard of 15μgm-3 are exceeded. In certain regions, PM10 and PM2.5 in cities are strongly affected by the regional aerosol background. There is no "universal" (i.e. valid for all sites) ratio between PM2.5 and PM10 mass concentrations, although fairly constant ratios do exist at individual sites. There is no universal correlation between PM mass concentration on the one hand, and total particle number concentration on the other hand, although a 'baseline' ratio between number and mass is found for sites not affected by local emissions. This paper is the first part of two companion papers of which the second part describes chemical characteristics. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Indoor and outdoor concentrations of particle matter (PM) and associated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in summer and winter in two industrial cities in Shizuoka, Japan, were determined. Fine particles (PM2.5) accounted for 44-56% of the total suspended PM. Most (>80%) of the PAHs associated with the particles were in the PM2.5 fraction. The concentration of PAHs, but not particles, was elevated in winter. A strong correlation (p < 0.01) between indoor and outdoor air was found for almost PAHs measured, but not for particles. Ratios of indoor to outdoor PAH concentrations showed that the indoor PAHs were mostly from outdoor sources, and the trends were especially noticeable in winter. In spite of the high contribution of PAHs to PM2.5, no significant correlation was found between the concentration of PM2.5 and the associated PAH concentration either indoors or outdoors. Outdoors, individual relative PAH concentrations (normalized to benzo[e]pyrene concentration) were greater in winter than in summer for light molecular PAHs (∼4 rings), as well as for benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), whereas the seasonal differences for other heavy molecular PAHs (except BaP) were negligible. This suggested that the contributions of decay reactions such as photodegradation were relatively small for the heavy molecular PAHs. Carcinogenic risks associated with the inhalation of indoor PAHs were assessed, and BaP showed the greatest contribution (51-64%) to the total carcinogenic risk. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {The ultraviolet aerodynamic particle sizer (UVAPS) is a novel aerosol counter for real-time monitoring of viable bioaerosols. The previous validation studies on the UVAPS were either laboratory based or were conducted outdoor with the artificially generated aerosols. In this study, the spectrometer was applied to investigate particulate pollution inside a swine confinement building (SCB). Real-time capabilities of the instrument were used to investigate the effect of on-farm-activities, such as an effluent flushing with recycled water, on aerosols load inside the SCB. In addition to the UVAPS, monitoring of viable bioaerosols (bacteria and fungi) was simultaneously conducted with the six-stage Andersen microbial impactor and the AGI-30 impingers. The UVAPS measurements showed that the concentrations of both viable (fluorescent) and total (fluorescent and non-fluorescent) particles inside the SCB were in order of 106-107particlesm-3. These concentrations were approximately seven times the outside concentrations for total particles and up to 12 times for viable particles. Approximately 95% of both total and viable particles were respirable (<7μm) and approximately 60% of total and 50% of viable particles accounted for the fine particle fraction (<2.5μm). The concentration of culturable bacteria and fungi ranged from 1.12×10 5 to 5.17×105CFUm-3 and from 1.12×103 to 2.79×103CFUm-3, respectively. Approximately 50-80% of airborne particles which carried culturable fungi were within the respirable size range. The concentration of viable particles measured with the UVAPS was at least one order of magnitude higher than the concentration of the culturable microorganisms measured with the AGI-30 impingers. Nevertheless, the trends in the concentration changes of viable bioaerosols measured with the UVAPS followed the trends in the concentration changes of the culturable airborne microorganisms quite adequately. Thus, it was concluded that the UVAPS is an appropriate method for investigating the dynamic of viable bioaerosols in the SCBs. The results obtained in this study assist in advancing an understanding of the UVAPS performance in the real-life agricultural settings. In addition, the data provide a new insight on the particles size distribution inside the SCB, depending on their nature. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Fungi are ubiquitous in nature and their spores are often dispersed into the atmosphere through turbulent airstreams. As yellow sandstorm blown from deserts in China had affected the ambient air quality with increasing levels of ambient particulates, often including significant amounts of biologically active particles has therefore become imperative for concerns of their health implications. Our study was aimed to examine the effects of yellow sandstorm events on the fungal composition and concentrations in ambient air. Atmospheric fungal spores were continuously collected using Burkard Volumetric Spore Trap. Samples collected between December 2000 and April 2001 were selected for priority analysis from days when the yellow sandstorms were reported to affect Taiwan according to the Central Weather Bureau in Taiwan. The composition of dominant spores such as Basidiospore, Penicillium/Aspergillus, Nigrospora, Arthrinium, Curvularia, Rusts, Stemphylium, Cercospora, Pithomyces, and unidentified fungi were significantly higher than those of background days. The increase of Basidiospore, Penicillium/Aspergillus, Nigrospora, and those unidentified fungi seems to be significantly associated with the increase of ambient particulate levels with regression coefficients ranging from 0.887 to 31.98. Our study has identified increasing ambient concentrations during sandstorm episodes are observed for some major fungi, Basidiospore, Penicillium, Aspergillus, and those unidentified fungi and the trends of the increase seems to associate with ambient particulate levels. Further efforts to clarify the relationship between those high fungal spore exposures and clinical adverse health effects are suggested in the future. In addition, effects of climatic factors and other particulate levels on the variation of ambient fungal spore levels are also desired in further study. Additional monitoring of ambient fungal spores in the first line of west coastline is hoped to assist in differentiating changes of local spores and contribution for sandstorms during the episodes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {In situ measurements of CO, NOx, PM10 and certain organic compounds took place over an 11 day period encompassing a 12h motorway blockade. Located within the Inn valley (Tirol, Austria), the monitoring site experiences varying meteorological conditions and traffic frequency throughout the day which both strongly influence air pollutant levels. Early morning increases of NOx, PM10 and aromatic hydrocarbons were clearly correlated with rising traffic. Midday minima and afternoon maxima may be explained by changing wind conditions and varying inversion layer dynamics. Night time lows in concentrations can be explained by minimal traffic activity. Classification of compound sources was made through grouping of data, separated into times when heavy duty vehicles (HDV) were permitted to use the motorway and HDV-ban periods. Increased levels of NOx and PM10 were observed from data that included periods of high HDV numbers, with levels decreasing significantly during HDV-ban periods. In contrast, the aromatic hydrocarbons and CO displayed only minor variations between these two periods. Furthermore, on typical workdays NOx levels reached a maximum that corresponded to a peak in HDV numbers, whereas the aromatic compounds peaked later when LDV numbers had reached their maximum. Our findings give strong evidence that increased NOx and PM10 levels can be predominantly attributed to HDV traffic. Principal components analyses for the separated data further support this conclusion. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Concentrations of 5-min PM2.5 black carbon (BC) and hourly criteria air pollutants (PM10, CO, NO x, SO2, and O3) were also measured using the Aethalometer and ambient air monitoring system, respectively. Highest PM 2.5 mass concentrations at Chongju, Kwangju, and Seoul sites were 63.0, 77.9, and 143.7μgm-3, respectively. For the time period when highest PM2.5 mass occurred, BC level out of PM2.5 chemical species was highest at both Chongju and Kwangju, and highest NO 3- (23.6μgm-3) followed by BC (23.1μgm-3) were observed at Seoul site, indicating that highest PM2.5 pollution is closely associated with the traffic emissions. Strong relationships of Fe with BC and Zn at both Kwangju and Seoul sites support that the Fe and Zn measured there are originated partly from same source as BC, i.e. diesel traffics. However, it is suggested that the Fe measured at Chongju is most likely derived from dispersion of soil dust. The size distributions of SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+ ionic species indicated similar unimodal distributions at all sampling sites. However, different unimodal patterns in the accumulation mode size range with a peak in the smaller size (0.28-0.53μm, condensation mode) in both Kwangju and Seoul, and in the relatively larger size (0.53-1.0μm, droplet mode) in Chongju, were found. The potassium ion under the study sites dominates in the fine mode, and its size distribution showed unimodal character with a maximum in the size range 0.56-1.0μm. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Detailed livestock-related emission inventories are now available for gases but not for bioaerosols, which are emitted in significant amounts and in varying compositions. In view of the environmental importance of bioaerosols, a model for their calculation is proposed here. The basic formula multiplies emission factors by the number of farm animals, but the model is extended by a factor which considers provisionally the influence of production cycles of various types of livestock on the estimated emissions. Despite several uncertainty factors, emissions factors are calculated for dust (inhalable, respirable), endotoxins (inhalable, respirable) and microorganisms (total mesophilic bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae, fungi) from ventilated livestock buildings. The calculation model and the emission factors are the basis for a simple geographical information system designed to display the calculated emission potencies of livestock-related bioaerosols for the year 1999 in the 46 districts and autonomous cities in Lower Saxony, Germany. The three highest emissions of inhalable dust were determined for the three animal-dense districts of Grafschaft Bentheim (485.3 kg a -1 km -2), Cloppenburg (648.8 kg a -1 km -2) and Vechta (1203.4 kg a -1 km -2). On the other hand, the lowest bioaerosol emissions were found for the cities of Salzgitter (9.6 kg a -1 km -2), Braunschweig (10.6 kg a -1 km -2) and Wolfenbüttel (12.2 kg a -1 km -2) due to their more urban, non-agricultural setting. With the aid of the agricultural census data, the percentages of temporal emission variations were assessed between 1996 and 1999, and found to have changed distinctly due to fluctuations in animal numbers in the districts. The following changes were noted in the three districts with the greatest increase or decrease of emitted particulate matter from 1996 to 1999: more inhalable dust was emitted in the rural districts of Stade (+9.6%), Cloppenburg (+14.9%) and Emsland (+18.2%), while there were clear declines in Oldenburg City (-24.1%), the district Helmstedt (-15.1%) and Braunschweig City (-14.4%). © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) are a widespread centrarchid species with both riverine and lacustrine populations. After precipitation events, rivers often carry elevated silt loads, where as lakes generally remain free from suspended silt and sediment. To examine the physiological effects of silt on rock bass, we conducted a series of experiments using fish from Lake Opinicon and the Grand River in Ontario. Ultrasonic Doppler flow probes were surgically affixed around the ventral aorta to monitor cardiovascular performance. After recovery from surgery replicated treatment groups were exposed to incremental increases in silt load (made from bentonite slurry), while cardiac output and its two components, heart rate and stroke volume, were measured simultaneously. Although both groups of rock bass responded significantly to low concentrations of silt (10 NTU), the response by riverine rock bass was rapidly extinguished by acclimation or physiological adjustment. Compensatory mechanisms to minimize cardiac (and respiratory) disruption attributable to increases in suspended silt appear to be inherent in rock bass of riverine origin. These fish appear to fully compensate for interference in gas exchange at the gill surfaces 60 min after initial exposure. In contrast, individual lacustrine rock bass were highly variable in their response to elevated silt concentrations. Changes in stroke volume and cardiac output suggested no clear compensatory mechanism or strategy to cope with increased silt levels. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {This study describes the application of a novel technique for obtaining vertical profiles (0-400m above ground level) of PM size distributions in a highly polluted setting dominated by domestic burning of wood and coal. At night, smoke from domestic fires is emitted into a highly stable and shallow katabatic flow layer. This layer is only ∼20-40m in depth and gives rise to very high concentrations that may persist late into the night. The mass size distribution of wood/coal smoke in Christchurch is overwhelmingly dominated by fine particles (<1μm in aerodynamic diameter). The vertical profiles reveal that layers of pollutants (with distinct PM signatures) may be found in such wintertime nocturnal settings. In Christchurch (population ∼400,000) a dominant mechanism appears to be undercutting by shallow drainage flows. This creates elevated layers with a daytime surface PM signature (predominately coarse material with modes at 2.5 and 6.25μm). These results confirm the usefulness of the deployment of miniature optical PM instruments on tethered balloons in cool, humid, polluted conditions. Such measurements allow the proper evaluation of the current generation of air pollution dispersion models. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {AUPHEP was started in 1999 as a 5 years program to investigate the situation of the atmospheric aerosol with respect to effects on human health. At four different sites in Austria (3 urban and one rural site) an extended monitoring program was conducted for PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 as well as particle number concentration for 12 months each. Beside continuous measurements using TEOM and beta attenuation high-volume sampling of PM2.5 and PM10 provided samples for chemical analyses of various ions, heavy metals and organic compounds. Furthermore, carbonaceous material (TC, EC, OC) year round and PAHs on selected days were analyzed. From collocated public monitoring stations also pollutant gases (SO2, NO, NO2, O3, CO) and meteorological components are available. In winter and summer campaigns aerosol size spectra including chemical components were measured for at least one week each. All data are collected in a project data base (CD-ROM). While extensive data analysis will be presented in following papers, some general results are presented within this paper: annual averages for PM1 are between 10 and 20μgm -3, for PM2.5 between 15 and 26mgm-3 and for PM10 between 20 and 38μgm-3. Number concentrations are between 10,000 and 30,000cm-3. Urban concentrations are usually higher in winter, rural concentrations in summer. PM2.5 is in average around 70% of PM10, for PM1 this fraction is about 57%. Several studies on health effects are included in this project: a cross-sectional study on preschool and school children regarding lung function measurements and questionnaires about respiratory impairment in the surrounding area of the monitoring sites as well as time series studies on mortality and respiratory morbidity on the general population. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Individual hemolymph sampling was performed at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, 168, 336, 504 and 672 h during exposure. Every atrazine concentration induced a significant increase in the mean number of circulating hemocytes, without any concentration-response relation. A peak (1.6-fold increase) of hemocyte density was observed after 96 h of exposure. After 504 h, the number of hemocytes remained higher only in the snails exposed to the two highest concentrations. Granulocytes contributed most to the increase in hemocyte density in herbicide-exposed snails. Both short- (24 and 96 h) and long-term (504 h) exposures resulted in significant inhibition of hemocyte phagocytic activity upon E. coli. Over the long-term, phagocytosis recovered for the two lowest concentrations. After 504 h of exposure, every herbicide level resulted in a significant reduction of reactive oxygen species production in E. coli-stimulated hemocytes, which was not observed for short-term exposures. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Several studies regarding particulate matter in air pollution have been performed in Mexico City, but none have focused on environment exposure to particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PPAH), which are related to the occurrence of cardiopulmonary diseases and mortality. On this account, this study presents measurements of personal exposure to PPAH in different outdoor and indoor environments, as well as along roadways in Mexico City. The measurements were done with portable sensors based on photoelectric charging and diffusion charging to determine the PPAH concentrations and the joint active surface of all particles, respectively. The use of these two sensors in parallel is a useful tool to qualitatively identify the major sources and to describe the physical and chemical characteristics of the particles. The highest exposures were found in ambient air near traffic sources, mainly at sites with great influence of diesel vehicles, such as urban transfer bus stations. Roadway measurements showed that Mexican PPAH pollution levels are between those in large cities in Europe and USA. For indoor environments such as residences, shopping centers, restaurants and hospitality venues, it was found that secondhand smoke is the major contributor, however badly calibrated pilot stoves, inefficient ventilation and faulty air-conditioning systems can be additional sources of PPAH. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {To examine hypotheses regarding health effects of particulate matter, we conducted time series studies in Austrian urban and rural areas. Of the pollutants measured, ambient PM2.5 was most consistently associated with parameters of respiratory health. Time series studies applying semiparametric generalized additive models showed significant increases of respiratory hospital admissions (ICD 490-496) at age 65 and older. The early increase of 5.5% in Vienna at a lag of 2 days in males and of 5.6% per 10μg/m3 at a lag of 3 days in females was not observed in a nearby rural area. Another increase of respiratory admissions (mainly COPD) was observed after a lag of 10-11 days. A time series on a panel of 56 healthy preschool children showed a significant impact of the carbonaceous fraction of PM2.5 on tidal breathing pattern assessed by inductive plethysmography. In repeated oscillometric measurements of respiratory resistance in 164 healthy elementary school children not only immediate responses to fine particulates were found but also latent ones, possibly indicating inflammatory changes in airways. It may be speculated that the improvements of urban air quality prevented measurable effects on respiratory mortality. More sensitive indicators, however, still show acute impairments of respiratory function and health in elderly and children which are associated with fine particulates and subfractions related to motor traffic. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Particulate matter (PM), a component of urban air pollution that derives primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels, is responsible for a number of health effects in humans. Recent studies have demonstrated that the fine particles (PM2.5) present in high numbers in PM samples can be more harmful than larger particles, since they are more efficiently retained in the peripheral lung. In the present study, we have investigated the biological effects of PM2.5 on human lung epithelial cell line A549. Morphological analysis performed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy showed that fine particles interact with the cell surface, where they induce evident alterations and, subsequently, are internalized in the cytoplasm. Cytoskeletal components, in particular microfilaments and microtubules, cause modifications upon challenge with PM2.5. Of interest, an early cell response to the fine particulate is an increase of reactive oxygen species content, which can account for the observed cytoskeletal changes and the production of proinflammatory cytokines in A549 cells. In particular, exposure to PM2.5 promoted a dose- and time-dependent release of TNF-α and IL-6 in the cell medium. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The objective of this study was to assess the possible effects of Asian dust storms on the mortality of residents in Taipei, Taiwan, during the period from 1995 to 2000. We identified 39 dust storm episodes, which were classified as index days. Daily deaths on the index days were compared with deaths on the comparison days. We selected two comparison days for each index day, 7 days before the index day and 7 days after the index day. The strongest estimated effects of dust storms were increases of 7.66% in risk for respiratory disease 1 day after the event, 4.92% for total deaths 2 days following the dust storms and 2.59% for circulatory diseases 2 days following the dust storms. However, none of these effects were statistically significant. This study found greater specificity for associations with respiratory deaths, and this increases the likelihood that the association between dust events and daily mortality represents a causal relationship. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Our study found a significant positive association between air pollution and all nonaccidental mortality and specific mortality in both group of population (all ages and elderly) with a greater effect among the elderly, particularly for respiratory mortality. For this case, we observed a greater effect according to distributed lag models (0-5 days) among the elderly, with an estimated increase of 9.2% in the daily number of deaths for 10μg/m3 of daily black smoke [95% CI, 3.4-15.3].

Information was collected via postal surveys on 2744 adults resident in five neighborhoods in Northeast England. Perceptions were compared by individual factors (health status, age, and gender) and locality factors (relative deprivation, proximity to industry and district - Teesside or Sunderland, with different amounts of heavy industry). There was relatively little variation in views about air pollution and health links between neighborhoods. The greatest contrasts were found when comparing those living near or further from industry and between the two districts. Any differences were related more to awareness of illness in the neighborhood thought to be affected by air pollution, rather than belief that a particular disease was linked to air pollution. Chronic illness status and age were sometimes found to be associated with perceptions of disease affected by air pollution, but gender and material deprivation were not central to differences in risk perceptions among the population studied. In understanding public perceptions about the links between air quality and health, research should focus on the characteristics of places as well as of people. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

In addition, using data from the universal Quebec Health Insurance Plan, we identified individuals ≥65 years of age who, one year before death, had a diagnosis of CHF. Fixed-site air pollution monitors in Montreal provided daily mean levels of pollutants. We regressed the logarithm of daily counts of mortality on the daily mean levels of each pollutant, after accounting for seasonal and subseasonal fluctuations in the mortality time series, non-Poisson dispersion, weather variables, and other gaseous and particle pollutants. Using cause of death information, we did not find any associations between daily mortality for CHF and any air pollutants. The analyses of CHF defined from the medical record showed positive associations with coefficient of haze, the extinction coefficient, SO2, and NO2. For example, the mean percent increase in daily mortality for an increase in the coefficient of haze across the interquartile range was 4.32% (95% CI: 0.95-7.80%) and for NO2 it was 4.08% (95% CI: 0.59-7.68%).

Daily emergency room admissions to the Institute of the Heart of the University of São Paulo, as well as data concerning daily air pollutant levels and meteorological variables, were collected from January 1994 to August 1995. Generalized additive Poisson regressions were fitted to the logarithm of the expected values of total emergency room visits due to angina or acute myocardial infarction, controlling for smooth functions of season and weather and indicators for days of the week. All investigated pollutants were positively associated with ischemic cardiovascular disease emergency room visits, and the time lags were relatively short, but only CO presented an effect that was statistically significant. An interquartile range increase in CO was associated with an increase of 6.4% (95% CI: 0.7-12.1) in daily angina or acute myocardial infarction emergency room visits. This result did not change when estimates were done using linear models and natural cubic splines.

Changes in the risk of death by age group, gender, and combined cardiac-respiratory cause of death were estimated for both 1°C and 50-95th percentile increases in humidex using a generalized additive linear model. With air pollution terms in the models, relative risk (RR) point estimates narrowly exceeded 1.0 for all groups. Humidex effects were most apparent for females (RR=1.006, 95% CI=1.004-1.008 per 1°C humidex and RR=1.089, 95% CI=1.058-1.121 for 50th to 95th percentile humidex). When air pollution was omitted from the model, RR in the 50-95th percentile analysis increased less than 1.71% for all groups except females, for which RR decreased 1.42%. Differences in RR per 1°C humidex were all less than 0.12%. Confidence intervals narrowed slightly for all groups investigated. Heat stress has a statistically significant, yet minimal impact on Toronto populations, and air pollution does appear to have a small, but consistent confounding effect on humidex effect estimates. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

The haze episodes in Southeast Asia in 1983, 1984, 1991, 1994, and 1997 imposed threats to the environmental management of Malaysia and increased awareness of the environment. As a consequence, the government established Malaysian Air Quality Guidelines, the Air Pollution Index, and the Haze Action Plan to improve air quality. Air quality monitoring is part of the initial strategy in the pollution prevention program in Malaysia. Review of air pollution in Malaysia is based on the reports of the air quality monitoring in several large cities in Malaysia, which cover air pollutants such as Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM). The results of the monitoring indicate that Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) are the predominant pollutants. Other pollutants such as CO, Ox, SO2, and Pb are also observed in several big cities in Malaysia. The air pollution comes mainly from land transportation, industrial emissions, and open burning sources. Among them, land transportation contributes the most to air pollution.

In light of the known health effects of kerosene usage, this study aimed to quantify the health risk for people living in a densely populated informal settlement known as Cato Crest within the Durban metropolitan area. The pollutants investigated included nitrogen dioxide, benzene and toluene. Nitrogen dioxide is known to affect both respiratory and immune systems, benzene is carcinogenic while toluene has a neurological health end point. All three pollutants are harmful when inhaled. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) health risk assessment (HRA) framework was applied. Information on the exposure patterns of residents in Cato Crest were acquired through questionnaires in which data on fuel use, building structure, cooking habits and time-activity patterns were collected. Air quality monitoring of nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds was also conducted in the households. The time-activity pattern survey revealed that the exposure periods of individuals in Cato Crest were far greater than the default exposure periods used by the US EPA. The results of the HRA showed that the residents of Cato Crest may experience significant health risks as a result of kerosene usage in their homes. Exposure to 1-h nitrogen dioxide concentration is not likely to produce adverse health effects, whereas exposure over a 24-h period indicates a potential health risk to sensitive individuals in two of the households when US EPA exposure values are used and in all of the households when locally derived exposure values are used. Benzene poses a health risk to sensitive individuals in 50% of the households when local exposure parameters are used, whereas there is no health risk associated with exposure to toluene. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Metals investigated included vanadium, chromium, manganese, nickel, copper, and lead. Subjects were monitored for 5 consecutive days during boiler repair overhauls in 1999 (n=20) and 2000 (n=14). In 1999, we found a significant inverse association between log-transformed FENO and PM2.5 metal concentrations. LogFENO changed by -0.03 (95% CI: -0.04, -0.01), -0.56 (95% CI: -0.88, -0.24), -0.09 (95% CI: -0.16, -0.02), and -0.04 (95% CI: -0.07, -0.02) per μg/m3 of PM2.5 vanadium, chromium, manganese, and nickel, respectively. In 2000, no significant associations were observed, most likely due to exposure misclassification resulting from the use of respirators. The inverse association between PM2.5 metal exposure and F ENO in subjects with limited respirator usage suggests that soluble transition metals might be partially responsible for the adverse pulmonary responses seen in workers exposed to ROFA. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

We wanted to test how living environment, occupation and social position were associated with nasal symptoms. Methods: In a postal survey study of a random sample of 12,079 adults, aged 20-59 years living in the southern part of Sweden the relationship between nasal symptoms, socio-economic status and environmental factors was analysed. Results: The response rate was 70% In = 8469) of whom 33% reported significant nasal symptoms. Nasal discharge, thick yellow discharge, a blocked nose, sneezing and itching were strongly associated with living close to heavy traffic or living in cities Most of the nasal symptoms provoked by extrinsic factors were more frequently reported among subjects who lived close to heavy traffic and in cities. Apart from thick yellow discharge and nasal symptoms provoked by damp/cold air which were more common in the socio-economic position "low" no relation to the socio-economic group was found. The prevalence of self-reported hay fever was neither affected by site of living nor by socio-economic status. Nasal symptoms evoked by "allergic" factors were linked to asthma but symptoms evoked by non-allergic factors were linked to chronic bronchitis/emphysema CBE. Conclusions: To conclude, we found a strong relation between geographical site and the prevalence of self-reported nasal symptoms which emphasizes the environment as a risk factor for nasal symptoms. Only by merging the socio-economic groups into "low" and "middle/high" an association to nasal symptoms was apparent.

Information was collected via postal surveys on 2744 adults resident in five neighborhoods in Northeast England. Perceptions were compared by individual factors (health status, age, and gender) and locality factors (relative deprivation, proximity to industry and district - Teesside or Sunderland, with different amounts of heavy industry). There was relatively little variation in views about air pollution and health links between neighborhoods. The greatest contrasts were found when comparing those living near or further from industry and between the two districts. Any differences were related more to awareness of illness in the neighborhood thought to be affected by air pollution, rather than belief that a particular disease was linked to air pollution. Chronic illness status and age were sometimes found to be associated with perceptions of disease affected by air pollution, but gender and material deprivation were not central to differences in risk perceptions among the population studied. In understanding public perceptions about the links between air quality and health, research should focus on the characteristics of places as well as of people. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

   abstract = {The release of Streptomyces albus propagules from contaminated agar and ceiling tile surfaces was studied under controlled environmental conditions in a newly developed aerosolization chamber. The experiments revealed that both spores and cell fragments can be simultaneously released from the colonized surface by relatively gentle air currents of 0.3ms-1. A 100× increase of the air velocity can result in a 50-fold increase in the number of released propagules. The aerosolization rate depends strongly on the type and roughness of the contaminated surface. Up to 90% of available actinomycete propagules can become airborne during the first 10min of the release process. Application of vibration to the surface did not reveal any influence on the aerosolization process of S. albus propagules under the tested conditions. This study has shown that propagules in the fine particle size range can be released in large amounts from contaminated surfaces. Measurement of the number of S. albus fragments in the vicinity of a contaminated area, as an alternative to conventional air or surface sampling, appears to be a promising approach for quantitative exposure assessment. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

In this study, we investigated the association between the fractional concentration of expired nitric oxide (FENO) and exposure to metal constituents of particulate matter with an aerodynamic mass median diameter≤2.5μm (PM2.5) in boilermakers exposed to ROFA and metal fume. Metals investigated included vanadium, chromium, manganese, nickel, copper, and lead. Subjects were monitored for 5 consecutive days during boiler repair overhauls in 1999 (n=20) and 2000 (n=14). In 1999, we found a significant inverse association between log-transformed FENO and PM2.5 metal concentrations. LogFENO changed by -0.03 (95% CI: -0.04, -0.01), -0.56 (95% CI: -0.88, -0.24), -0.09 (95% CI: -0.16, -0.02), and -0.04 (95% CI: -0.07, -0.02) per μg/m3 of PM2.5 vanadium, chromium, manganese, and nickel, respectively. In 2000, no significant associations were observed, most likely due to exposure misclassification resulting from the use of respirators. The inverse association between PM2.5 metal exposure and F ENO in subjects with limited respirator usage suggests that soluble transition metals might be partially responsible for the adverse pulmonary responses seen in workers exposed to ROFA. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

We wanted to test how living environment, occupation and social position were associated with nasal symptoms. Methods: In a postal survey study of a random sample of 12,079 adults, aged 20-59 years living in the southern part of Sweden the relationship between nasal symptoms, socio-economic status and environmental factors was analysed. Results: The response rate was 70% In = 8469) of whom 33% reported significant nasal symptoms. Nasal discharge, thick yellow discharge, a blocked nose, sneezing and itching were strongly associated with living close to heavy traffic or living in cities Most of the nasal symptoms provoked by extrinsic factors were more frequently reported among subjects who lived close to heavy traffic and in cities. Apart from thick yellow discharge and nasal symptoms provoked by damp/cold air which were more common in the socio-economic position "low" no relation to the socio-economic group was found. The prevalence of self-reported hay fever was neither affected by site of living nor by socio-economic status. Nasal symptoms evoked by "allergic" factors were linked to asthma but symptoms evoked by non-allergic factors were linked to chronic bronchitis/emphysema CBE. Conclusions: To conclude, we found a strong relation between geographical site and the prevalence of self-reported nasal symptoms which emphasizes the environment as a risk factor for nasal symptoms. Only by merging the socio-economic groups into "low" and "middle/high" an association to nasal symptoms was apparent. Nasal symptoms evoked by "allergic" factors were linked to asthma but symptoms evoked by "non allergic factors" were linked to CBE. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. Alt rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The closing down of a lindane factory near Rio de Janeiro, over 45 years ago, left an area heavily contaminated with hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH). Remediation by soil liming was applied by government authorities in 1995. This study aims to evaluate the HCH distribution and impact on soil microbiota due to contamination and liming. Microcosm experiments with uncontaminated soil mixed with HCH and lime indicated that lime-promoted dechlorination of HCH molecules led to leaching and volatilization of metabolites. The treatment applied transformed but did not solve the problem as most of the HCH remains in the soil. Reduced microbial respiratory activity was measured in contaminated field samples. Higher respiration rates in uncontaminated soil were reduced by HCH and lime addition; the sole addition of HCH caused a temporary increase in soil respiration, and stimulation occurred with oxygen and/or nutrient addition. A heterotrophic bacterial population around 109CFU/g was found in polluted field soil, some well-known degraders having been isolated. Native soil microbiota showed resistance to high amounts of HCH and alkaline pH. The results allow considering bioremediation rather than chemical treatments to clean up the area. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Viozan™, (Sibenadet HCl, AR-C68397AA) is a dual D2 dopamine receptor, β2-adrenoceptor agonist that combines bronchodilator activity with the sensory afferent modulating effects associated with D2-receptor agonism. Investigation in animal models of key chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) symptoms has demonstrated that sibenadet effectively inhibits sensory nerve activity, thereby reducing reflex cough, mucus production and tachypnoea. The results of the early clinical evaluation of this novel agent are reported. An initial proof of concept study (Study 1) aimed to determine the clinical potential of this novel agent by assessing the effects of three doses of sibenadet therapy relative to placebo, with two commonly used bronchodilators, intended to provide a benchmark against which sibenadet activity could be judged. In all, 701 patients were randomized to one of three sibenadet dose groups (400, 600 or 1000 μg ex valve), salbutamol 200 μg, ipratropium bromide (IB) 40 μg or placebo, all three times daily via pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) for 4 weeks. Once the results of Study 1 had been evaluated, a dose-ranging, study (Study 2) involving 872 patients randomized to receive sibenadet (45, 270, or 495 μg ex actuator), or placebo all three times daily via pMDI, for 6 weeks commenced. Both studies were preceded by a 2-week baseline phase and followed by a 2-week follow up period.The primary efficacy variable identified changes in key COPD symptoms over the treatment period (compared with baseline data) as determined by the novel Breathlessness, Cough and Sputum Scale (BCSS©). In addition, data on lung function, health-related quality of life and adverse events were collected. Patients receiving sibenadet therapy three times daily exhibited statistically significantly greater improvements in BCSS total score than those receiving placebo or bronchodilator therapy alone. A clear dose-response was evident in Study 2. Symptom improvement in this study was also accompanied by improved lung function and health-related quality of life, Sibenadet therapy was well tolerated with an adverse events profile comparable to current bronchodilator therapy. These data were viewed as extremely encouraging, warranting further, large-scale clinical investigation. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

   abstract = {Study objective: To examine the relationship between social deprivation and risk of hospital admission for respiratory infection. Methods and subjects: Ecological study using hospital episode statistics and population census data. Cases were residents of the West Midlands Health Region admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of respiratory infection, acute respiratory infection, pneumonia or influenza over a 5-year period. Postcodes of cases were used to assign Townsend deprivation scores; these were then ranked and divided into five deprivation categories. Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate the magnitude of effect for associations between deprivation category and hospital admission by age and admitting diagnosis. Main results: There were 136755 admissions for respiratory infection, equivalent to an annual admission rate of 27.1 per 1000 population (95% CI = 26.9-27.2). Deprivation was associated with increased admission rates for all respiratory infection (P < 0.0001) and affected all age-groups. The greatest effect was in the 0-4 years age-group with admission rates 91% higher in the most deprived children compared to the least deprived. Hospital admissions for acute respiratory infection and pneumonia were both significantly associated with deprivation (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Respiratory infection is associated with social inequalities in all age-groups, particularly in children. Prevention of respiratory infection could make an important contribution to reducing health inequalities. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In addition, using data from the universal Quebec Health Insurance Plan, we identified individuals ≥65 years of age who, one year before death, had a diagnosis of CHF. Fixed-site air pollution monitors in Montreal provided daily mean levels of pollutants. We regressed the logarithm of daily counts of mortality on the daily mean levels of each pollutant, after accounting for seasonal and subseasonal fluctuations in the mortality time series, non-Poisson dispersion, weather variables, and other gaseous and particle pollutants. Using cause of death information, we did not find any associations between daily mortality for CHF and any air pollutants. The analyses of CHF defined from the medical record showed positive associations with coefficient of haze, the extinction coefficient, SO2, and NO2. For example, the mean percent increase in daily mortality for an increase in the coefficient of haze across the interquartile range was 4.32% (95% CI: 0.95-7.80%) and for NO2 it was 4.08% (95% CI: 0.59-7.68%).

Daily emergency room admissions to the Institute of the Heart of the University of São Paulo, as well as data concerning daily air pollutant levels and meteorological variables, were collected from January 1994 to August 1995. Generalized additive Poisson regressions were fitted to the logarithm of the expected values of total emergency room visits due to angina or acute myocardial infarction, controlling for smooth functions of season and weather and indicators for days of the week. All investigated pollutants were positively associated with ischemic cardiovascular disease emergency room visits, and the time lags were relatively short, but only CO presented an effect that was statistically significant. An interquartile range increase in CO was associated with an increase of 6.4% (95% CI: 0.7-12.1) in daily angina or acute myocardial infarction emergency room visits. This result did not change when estimates were done using linear models and natural cubic splines.

Changes in the risk of death by age group, gender, and combined cardiac-respiratory cause of death were estimated for both 1°C and 50-95th percentile increases in humidex using a generalized additive linear model. With air pollution terms in the models, relative risk (RR) point estimates narrowly exceeded 1.0 for all groups. Humidex effects were most apparent for females (RR=1.006, 95% CI=1.004-1.008 per 1°C humidex and RR=1.089, 95% CI=1.058-1.121 for 50th to 95th percentile humidex). When air pollution was omitted from the model, RR in the 50-95th percentile analysis increased less than 1.71% for all groups except females, for which RR decreased 1.42%. Differences in RR per 1°C humidex were all less than 0.12%. Confidence intervals narrowed slightly for all groups investigated. Heat stress has a statistically significant, yet minimal impact on Toronto populations, and air pollution does appear to have a small, but consistent confounding effect on humidex effect estimates. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

   abstract = {In the early days of abundant resources and minimal development pressures, little attention was paid to growing environmental concerns in Malaysia. The haze episodes in Southeast Asia in 1983, 1984, 1991, 1994, and 1997 imposed threats to the environmental management of Malaysia and increased awareness of the environment. As a consequence, the government established Malaysian Air Quality Guidelines, the Air Pollution Index, and the Haze Action Plan to improve air quality. Air quality monitoring is part of the initial strategy in the pollution prevention program in Malaysia. Review of air pollution in Malaysia is based on the reports of the air quality monitoring in several large cities in Malaysia, which cover air pollutants such as Carbon monoxide (CO), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3), and Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM). The results of the monitoring indicate that Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) are the predominant pollutants. Other pollutants such as CO, Ox, SO2, and Pb are also observed in several big cities in Malaysia. The air pollution comes mainly from land transportation, industrial emissions, and open burning sources. Among them, land transportation contributes the most to air pollution. This paper reviews the results of the ambient air quality monitoring and studies related to air pollution and health impacts. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Salt Lake City EPA Environmental Monitoring for Public Access and Community Tracking (EMPACT) project, initiated in October 1999, is designed to evaluate the usefulness of a newly developed real-time continuous monitor (RAMS) for total (non-volatile plus semi-volatile) PM2.5 mass and the health relevance of PM2.5 measured by this method as compared to other measurements of PM2.5 parameters. Ammonium nitrate and semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOC) are significant components of fine particles in many urban atmospheres. These components however, are not properly measured by current EPA accepted methods, such as the PM2.5 FRM, due to loss of semi-volatile material (SVM) from the filter during sampling. Continuous PM2.5 mass measurements are attempted using methods such as the R&P TEOM monitor. This method however, heats the sample to remove particle-bound water. This results in evaporation of significant amounts of semi-volatile material. Similarly, continuous carbonaceous material monitors are expected to lose semi-volatile organic material during sample collection. Continuous RAMS and collocated TEOM monitor data have been obtained at the EMPACT sampling site in Salt lake City, Utah during a 2-year period. Results obtained for the continuous determination of total PM2.5 mass with the RAMS have been validated by comparison with results obtained from collocated PC-BOSS diffusion denuder integrated samples at the EMPACT sampling site in Salt Lake City, Utah during three intensive sampling periods (winter 1999-2000, summer 2000, and winter 2000-2001). While the RAMS is shown to measure total PM2.5, including semi-volatile nitrate and organic material, commercially available semi-continuous TEOM and C monitors do not reliably measure these species. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {This study was set out to assess the characteristics and significance of metal contents emitted from diesel engines. We found that the emitted concentrations of crust elements (including Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, and Si) were much higher than those of anthropogenic elements (including Ag, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Sr, Ti, V, and Zn) from diesel vehicle engine exhausts under the transient-cycle condition. The emission concentrations of particulate matters from diesel vehicle engine were inversely proportional to the specified engine speeds. To the contrary, the increase of engine speeds resulted in increase of fractions of metal contents in particulate matters. We conducted simple linear regression analysis to relate the emission rates of the metal contents in vehicle exhaust to the consumption rates of metal contents in diesel fuel. This study yielded R2=0.999 which suggests that the emission of the metal contents in vehicle exhaust could be fully explained by the consumption of metal contents in diesel fuel. For illustration, we found that the annual emission rates of both crust and anthropogenic elements from all diesel engine vehicles (=269000 and 58700kgyr-1, respectively) were significantly higher than those from the coal power plant, electrical arc furnace, and coke oven (=90100 and 1660kgyr-1, 2060 and 173kgyr -1, and 60500 and 3740kgyr-1, respectively) in Taiwan area. The relatively high amount of metal contents emitted from diesel engines strongly suggests that the measurement on the control of metal contents in diesel fuel should be taken in the future. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Ground level and vertical measurements of aerosols (PM10) and meteorological parameters in the Salt Lake Valley were conducted as a part of the Vertical Transport and MiXing in the atmospheric boundary layer (VTMX) experiment, conducted during the period 1-18 October 2000. This component of the VTMX experiment was directed toward developing a deeper understanding of the factors affecting the distribution and transport of pollutants in urban areas within complex terrain. The present study focused on the temporal (diurnal) and vertical variation of PM10 concentration during the stable nighttime period as well as the morning and evening transition periods. The temporal variations in the aerosol concentration during these periods was dominated by thermally driven diurnal winds, with only minor influences from background synoptic winds. The increased aerosol concentration between sunrise and the afternoon was associated with the westerly up-slope winds that advected PM10 from the nearest source, the downtown area of Salt Lake City. In mid-afternoon the PM10 concentration decreased significantly due to the arrival of a northwesterly lake breeze near the ground. The lowest aerosol concentrations during the period from late afternoon to early morning are the result of the draining of cleaner air from the mountain slope after the wind shifted from westerly to easterly. The temporal variations in the wind direction and aerosol levels during the nighttime are discussed. A hypothesis is advanced, with some supporting evidence, that periodic variations of the nighttime PM10 concentrations owe to the shedding of vortices from the Wasatch mountain range bordering the lake. The vertical distribution of aerosols is sensitive to the thermal forcing, which exerts the driving influence on thermal circulation within the Salt Lake Valley. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The hourly PM2.5 mass was measured with a Rupprecht and Patashnick TEOM Series 1400a real-time monitor for approximately 2 years (January 1999-November 2000) at the same sites. Concentrations at the two sites were highly correlated, with Manhattan being slightly higher than at the Bronx. The concentrations of HNO3, HCl, NH3 and SO42- were higher during summer than winter, the summer/winter ratios at Manhattan being 3.9, 3.1, 1.5, and 1.9, respectively. The concentrations of HONO and SO2 were lower during summer than winter, the summer/winter ratios at Manhattan being 0.48 and 0.44, respectively. Gaseous HONO concentrations were higher than that of HNO3 except in summer, when the HNO3 was higher. The annual mean concentration of PM2.5 was 15.2μg/m3 at the Bronx, and 15.5μg/m3 at Manhattan (based only on days when data were available from both sites). The monthly mean concentrations at Manhattan ranged from 13.2 to 21.7μg/m3 and were highest in June and July 1999, and lowest in March and April. The monthly mean fraction of PM2.5 as SO42- ranged from 0.17 to 0.31, with the highest values observed during June-September. The hourly mean concentrations of PM2.5 showed a bimodal pattern, with peaks at around 7-8AM and 8-9PM. In general, the second maximum is lower than the morning one, but during summer this is reversed. The contributions from regional and local emissions and the influence of atmospheric transport and chemical reactions on the observed concentrations are discussed in a compendium paper. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {The Air Quality Management community is increasingly turning its attention to urban 'hot-spots' where localised high concentrations of pollutants can arise. One such location is the urban street canyon where dispersion is poorly understood or described by regulatory models because of the complexity of the airflow, turbulence and local influences. Similarly, simple metrics such as PM10 fail to describe the range of sizes, composition, sources and behaviours encompassed by the term 'particle'. A 2-week experimental case study to measure size-segregated aerosol in the size range 4.6nm-10μm at a fine time scale (10min resolution) was undertaken in a typical street canyon in Manchester. The wind direction incident to the canyon, and hence the vortex flow within the canyon, was found to have a large influence on the number concentrations, with values typically 2-10 times greater in perpendicular flow than the estimated inner-urban background. Concentrations were also inversely related to wind speed and directly related to traffic flow. Coarse mode mass concentrations were generally found to follow urban background PM10 concentrations except with a 0-5μgm-3 enhancement related to traffic-induced re-suspension within the canyon. A small pollution episode consisting of coarse material re-suspended by high winds was extended in time within the canyon. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Tobacco smoking simulation experiment was conducted in a test room under different conditions such as cigarette brands, smoking number, and post-smoke decay in forced ventilation or in closed indoor environments. Thirty-seven chemical species were targeted and monitored, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) markers. The results indicate that benzene, d-limonene, styrene, m-ethyltoluene and 1,2,4/1,3,5-trimethylbenzene are correlated well with ETS markers, but toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene are not evidently correlated with ETS markers because there are some potential indoor sources of these compounds. 2,5-dimethylfuran is considered to be a better ETS marker due to the relative stability in different cigarette brands and a good relationship with other ETS markers. The VOCs concentrations emitted by tobacco smoking were linearly associated with the number of cigarettes consumed, and different behaviors were observed in closed indoor environment, of which ETS markers, d-limonene, styrene, trimethylbenzene, etc. decayed fast, whereas benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, etc. decayed slowly and even increased in primary periods of the decay; hence ETS exposure in closed environments is believed to be more dangerous. VOCs concentrations and the relative percentage constituent of ETS markers of different brand cigarettes emissions vary largely, but the relative percentage constituent of ETS markers for the same brand cigarette emissions is similar. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {Epidemiological studies have shown a significant association between ambient particulate matter (PM) exposures and increased mortality and morbidity risk. Power plants are significant emitters of precursor gases of fine particulate matter. To evaluate the public health risk posed by power plants, it is necessary to evaluate population exposure to different pollutants. The concept of intake fraction (the fraction of a pollutant emitted that is eventually inhaled or ingested by a population) has been proposed to provide a simple summary measure of the relationship between emissions and exposure. Currently available intake fraction estimates from developing countries used models that look only at the near field impacts, which may not capture the full impact of a pollution source. This case study demonstrated how the intake fraction of power plant emissions in China can be calculated using a detailed long-range atmospheric dispersion model - CALPUFF. We found that the intake fraction of primary fine particles is roughly on the order of 10-5, while the intake fractions of sulfur dioxide, sulfate and nitrate are on the order of 10-6. These estimates are an order of magnitude higher than the US estimates. We also tested how sensitive the results were to key assumptions within the model. The size distribution of primary particles has a large impact on the intake fraction for primary particles while the background ammonia concentration is an important factor influencing the intake fraction of nitrate. The background ozone concentration has a moderate impact on the intake fraction of sulfate and nitrate. Our analysis shows that this approach is applicable to a developing country and it provides reasonable population exposure estimates. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {UK public houses generally allow smoking to occur and consequently customer ETS exposure can take place. To address this, in 1999 the UK Government and the hospitality industry initiated the Public Places Charter (PPC) to increase non-smoking facilities and provide better ventilation in public houses. A study involving 60 UK pubs, located in Greater Manchester, was conducted to investigate the effects of smoking area status and ventilation on ETS concentrations. ETS markers RSP, UVPM, FPM, SolPM and nicotine were sampled and analysed using established methodologies. ETS marker concentrations were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the smoking areas compared to the non-smoking areas of pubs that contained both smoking and non-smoking sections. Median concentrations of RSP and nicotine were reduced by 18% and 68%, respectively, in non-smoking areas. UVPM, FPM and SolPM median concentrations were reduced by 27%, 34% and 39%, demonstrating the increased tobacco-specificity of the particulate markers and the impact of non-smoking areas. Levels of particulate phase ETS markers were also found to be higher in the smoking sections of pubs that allowed smoking throughout compared to the smoking sections of pubs with other areas where smoking was prohibited. The presence of a non-smoking section has the effect of reducing concentrations even in the smoking areas. This may be caused by migration of smoke into the non-smoking section thereby diluting the smoking area or by smokers tending to avoid pubs with non-smoking areas thus reducing source strengths in the smoking areas of these pubs. Nicotine concentrations were not found to be significantly different in smoking areas of the two types of establishment indicating that nicotine is not as mobile in these environments and tends to remain in the smoking areas. This result, together with the much higher reductions in nicotine concentrations between smoking and non-smoking areas compared to other markers, suggests that nicotine is not the most suitable marker to use in these environments as an indicator of the effectiveness of tobacco control policies. The use of ventilation systems (sophisticated HVAC systems and extractor fans in either the on or off mode) did not have a significant effect (P > 0.05) on ETS marker concentrations in either the smoking or non-smoking areas. The PPC aims to reduce non-smoking customers' exposure through segregation and ventilation and provide customer choice though appropriate signs. This study indicates that although ETS levels are lower in non-smoking sections and signs will assist customers in reducing their exposure, some exposure will still occur because ETS was detected in non-smoking areas. Existing ventilation provision was not effective in reducing exposure and signs advertising ventilated premises may be misleading to customers. Improvements in the design and management of ventilation systems in pubs and bars are required to reduce customer exposure to ETS, if the aims of the PPC are to be met. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In light of the known health effects of kerosene usage, this study aimed to quantify the health risk for people living in a densely populated informal settlement known as Cato Crest within the Durban metropolitan area. The pollutants investigated included nitrogen dioxide, benzene and toluene. Nitrogen dioxide is known to affect both respiratory and immune systems, benzene is carcinogenic while toluene has a neurological health end point. All three pollutants are harmful when inhaled. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) health risk assessment (HRA) framework was applied. Information on the exposure patterns of residents in Cato Crest were acquired through questionnaires in which data on fuel use, building structure, cooking habits and time-activity patterns were collected. Air quality monitoring of nitrogen dioxide and volatile organic compounds was also conducted in the households. The time-activity pattern survey revealed that the exposure periods of individuals in Cato Crest were far greater than the default exposure periods used by the US EPA. The results of the HRA showed that the residents of Cato Crest may experience significant health risks as a result of kerosene usage in their homes. Exposure to 1-h nitrogen dioxide concentration is not likely to produce adverse health effects, whereas exposure over a 24-h period indicates a potential health risk to sensitive individuals in two of the households when US EPA exposure values are used and in all of the households when locally derived exposure values are used. Benzene poses a health risk to sensitive individuals in 50% of the households when local exposure parameters are used, whereas there is no health risk associated with exposure to toluene. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {Three research flights were conducted during August 2001 as part of the PNW2001 field study in the Puget Sound region. Each flight presented a case study of unique sources, meteorological conditions, and spatial distributions of pollutants. On 10 August, an urban smog episode was sampled downwind of the Puget Sound Seattle-Vancouver corridor containing high mixing ratios of O3 (∼80ppbv) and high aerosol scattering coefficients (σsp) (∼35Mm-1). The ozone and σsp measured during this flight were typical of summer pollution events in the Puget Sound region. The AIRPACT forecast model (MM5-CALMET-CALGRID) showed variable results when compared to surface measurements. In addition, predicted surface O3 maxima were several hours too early and fell off sharply relative to observations. AIRPACT generally under-predicted upper-level O3 concentrations and misplaced the observed O3 maxima. On 16 August, a second pollution region was encountered in a broad layer between 2 and 4.5km above a well-defined temperature inversion. Meteorological analysis and satellite imagery suggest the high O3 mixing ratios (60ppbv) and very high σsp (80Mm-1) were from fires burning in Washington, Oregon, and Northern California. IMPROVE aerosol chemistry data from sites in the Cascade Mountains showed evidence of biomass burning emissions reaching the surface 2 days prior to this flight. The last flight, on 20 August, sampled slightly polluted background conditions in the region. Ozone levels reached only 30ppbv and σsp reached 20Mm-1 at the surface, but was much lower aloft. Therefore, this flight was representative of background conditions during the summer in this region. The results from these research flights provide evidence of enhanced O3 and σsp, extending to 4km altitude over Puget Sound, during the summer months from varying sources. They further demonstrate the current capability of the AIRPACT O3 forecast system and, in one case, illustrate the need to include biomass-burning emissions in the model forecasts. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Study objective: The main purpose of this paper was to assess the impact of the outdoor and indoor air quality on the growth rate of preadolescent children after accounting for parental height and potential confounders. The data were collected from a cohort prospective epidemiological study on the effect of air pollution on respiratory diseases in children in Krakow. Participants: Of the 1044 children covered by the study, the records were complete for 958 children. Characteristics of the outdoor air pollution level in the residence area was based on the communal air pollutants, such as SPM (suspended particulate matter) and SO2. In the city center (highly polluted area) the mean level of SPM over a 5-year period for the winter season was 103.5 μg/m3 and that of SO2 was 86.9 μ μg/m3; the corresponding values in the summer season were 32.3 μg/m3 and 41.8 μg/m3. The body growth rates of children were assessed by their height changes over a 2-year period. Main results: The body growth rates over the 2-year period in children from the highly polluted area was lower by 1.5 cm than those from the control area. Of the total growth rate variability explained by the multivariate model over the follow-up, about 3.1% has been explained by air pollution in the residence area. The compromising effect of higher air pollution in the residence area on height gain was about the same in shorter and taller children. Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that a child's growth rate is related to the postnatal air pollution level in the residence area. The results may have important implications for epidemiological studies on lung function in children related to environmental exposures. As the height gain is lower in exposed subjects and this does produce a height deficit, the estimates of adjusted lung function to body size may be biased. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry was performed on all kidney samples. The presence of inclusion bodies and karyocytomegaly was scored. Six adult rats out of 21 (28.6%) showed kariocytomegaly and intranuclear inclusion bodies of the renal proximal tubules, characteristic of lead toxicity.

The six rats which showed the characteristic histological alterations ascribed to lead, had lead concentrations statistically higher than the three control rats (4 mg/g wet wt. versus 0.09 mg/g wet wt., P<0.001) and than the captured wild rats. Intranuclear inclusion bodies were found in rats with kidney lead concentrations greater than 0.6 mg/g wet weight. There were significant di1erences between the four areas of capture. The incidence of intranuclear inclusion bodies and karyocytomegaly in proximal tubular cells was higher in rats with high lead levels detected by spectrophotometry. The present results indicate a renal lead concentration of 0.6 mg/g wet weight as a threshold to detect histologic kidney changes due to lead absorption.

During the sampling period, a total of 80 CO, 80 PM10 and 56 PM2.5 samples were conducted in four popular commuting modes (subway, air-conditioned bus, non-air-conditioned bus and taxi) while running in typical urban routes. The results show that the PM10 as well as CO level is greatly influenced by the mode of transport. The highest mean PM10 and CO level was obtained in a non-air-conditioned bus (203 μg m-3) and in an air-conditioned taxi (28.7 ppm), respectively. Noticeably, the exposure levels in subway are lower than those in the roadway transports. The ventilation condition of the transport is also a crucial factor affecting the in-vehicle level. There was statistically significant difference of PM10(p<0.01) and CO (p<0.01) level in taxi and PM10(p<0.01) level in bus between natural and mechanical ventilation. In this study, the effect of driving time has minor impact on the in-vehicle level. The exposure levels were only slightly lower in afternoon non-peak hour than in evening peak hour. This is related to the fact that the road traffic in the selected urban routes is dominated by the extensive use of public transports, which provide service at regular intervals regardless of the time of day. The PM2.5 inter-microenvironment variation is similar to the pattern of PM10. The PM2.5 to PM10 ratio in the transports was high, ranging from 76% to 83%.

   abstract = {Deposition of element-specific particulate matter in the respiratory system of a Caucasian-type healthy adult male and female was computed by a stochastic lung deposition model for different reference levels of physical exertion using mass size distributions in the aerodynamic diameter interval of 0.125-16 μm experimentally determined in urban environments. Particles with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than about 0.3 μm are deposited in the whole respiratory system decreasingly with rising physical exertion, while the opposite is observed for particles with an aerodynamic diameter larger than about 0.7 μm (except for the highest physical activity). It is the light exercise that causes the largest extrathoracic (ET) deposition efficiency of the particles in this last diameter range, and, consequently, the smallest tracheobronchial and acinar depositions. The results obtained indicate that ET deposition depends primarily on the size distribution of the inhaled particles, while physical exertion plays a minor role. In contrast, deposition fractions of different aerosol species in the lungs are very similar to each other for a given physical exertion, despite the rather diverse size distributions of some species, but depend significantly on the subject's physical exertion. The differential deposition curves generally exhibit two peaks, one in the tracheobronchial and one in the acinar region. Both differential and regional deposition fractions do not change in a monotonical fashion with physical exertion but display maximum values approximately at the exertion level corresponding to the switching point between the nose-breathing mode and the combined nose- and mouth-breathing mode. Deposition rates (mass doses), however, increase monotonically with physical exertion due to increased ventilation rates, and more particles reach the deeper parts of the lung. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The season wise shares of PM10 and PM2.5 to PM are computed. Results indicate highest contribution of PM10 to PM during local summer/premonsoon while the contribution of PM2.5 to PM peaks during local winter. These shares are lowest during monsoon months. Average values of PM10 and PM2.5 were found to be around 50 and 43 μg m-3 under ambient conditions. For making an environmental assessment these values are corrected for humidity changes and reduced to a constant RH level of 50%. An order of magnitude estimate is made of the sea salt contribution to the total based on recent measurements during the INDOEX. After these apportionments, it is found that even though the PM10 concentration is well below the standards set by several national environmental agencies, the PM2.5 concentration appears to be quite critical.

The pH and conductivity K of water-soluble matters of PM10 and PM2.5 were determined, and the water-soluble fraction of the sample was followed to identify the total carbon (TC), total organic carbon (TOC), inorganic carbon (IC), elements, NO3-, SO42- and NH3-N. The experimental results show that water-soluble matters of PM10 and PM2.5 in Nanjing are acidic, and the pH of PM2.5 is lower than PM10. Conductivity of water-soluble species of PM10 and PM2.5 aerosols varied over a wide range from 1087 to 225 μs/cm. Conductivity between PM10 and PM2.5 has a linear correlationship, and the equation is Y = 0.8459X + 44.74, r2 = 0.9376 (Y: conductivity of PM2.5, X: conductivity of PM10). TOC make up the majority of TC and accounts for 3.17-14.13% of PM10 and/or PM2.5 loadings, while IC only accounts for 0.12-0.47% of PM10 and/or PM2.5 mass. Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, Ti, V and Zn, 17 elements were detected in water-soluble matters of PM10 and/or PM2.5. Ca, K and Na are the most abundant chemical components, which account for more than 95% of total water-soluble elements (TWSE). Of all the five sites, TWSE accounts for 1.80-6.13% of the particle mass and 61.28-72.73% of TWSE of PM10 is enriched in fine particles (< 2.5 μm in diameter). Nitrate (NO3-), sulfate (SO42-), ammonia and ammonium (NH3-N) were determined. The highest level of nitrate was 15.49 μg/m3 for PM10 and 12.66 μg/m3 for PM2.5 at site FZ. As was the case for nitrate, the highest level of sulfate was also presented at the same site, which was 28.22 μg/m3 for PM10 and 21.48 μg/m3 for PM2.5. However, a higher level of ammonia and ammonium was presented at site ZS, which was 36.05 μg/m3 for PM10 and 22.06 μg/m3 for PM2.5. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The development of ozone control strategies requires analysing the sensitivity of the dispersion model used to changes in emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX) and volatile organic compounds. The ozone response to variations in road traffic and total anthropogenic emissions is evaluated for two different summer ozone episodes in the Greater Madrid Area (GMA). This study uses the TVM model and a transport/chemistry module in which different chemical mechanisms (EMEP, RACM) are implemented. The results show that the areas of maximum impact and ozone responses are notably influenced by the different transport and dispersion patterns established in the area. However, the contribution of anthropogenic sources other than road traffic is patent in both episodes. Strategies based only on decreasing road traffic emissions were not sufficient for an effective control of the air quality in the GMA. Moreover, certain discrepancies observed in the predicted trends, as a response to these control strategies posed, reflect the importance of variations in the precursors balance. The ozone production regime associated to these ozone episodes and the sensitivity of the ozone response to changes in this balance has been investigated. A chemical indicator has been used to deepen in that evaluation. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

   abstract = {Particle measurements were conducted at a road site 15km north of the city of Gothenburg for 3 weeks in June 2000. The size distribution between 10 and 368nm was measured continuously by using a differential mobility particle sizer (DMPS) system. PM2.5 was sampled on a daily basis with subsequent elemental analysis using EDXRF-spectroscopy. The road is a straight four-lane road with a speed limit of 90kph. The road passing the site is flat with no elevations where the vehicles run on a steady workload and with constant speed. The traffic intensity is about 20,000 cars per workday and 13,000 vehicles per day during weekends. The diesel fuel used in Sweden is low in sulphur content (<10ppm) and therefore the diesel vehicles passing the site contribute less to particle emissions in comparison with other studies. A correlation between PM2.5 and accumulation mode particles (100-368nm) was observed. However, no significant correlation was found between number concentrations of ultrafine particles (10-100nm) and PM2.5 or the accumulation mode number concentration. The particle distribution between 10 and 368nm showed great dependency on wind speed and wind direction, where the wind speed was the dominant factor for ultrafine (10-100nm) particle concentrations. The difference in traffic intensity between workday and weekend together with wind data made it possible to single out the traffic contribution to particle emissions and measure the size distribution. The results presented in combination with previous studies show that both PM2.5 and the mass of accumulation mode particles are bad estimates for ultrafine particles. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

   abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a powerful tool for the characterization of nanoparticles allowing to obtain fundamental parameters of morphology such as the size of individual particles, the number of particles per aggregate, the size distribution and finally the AFM allows one to determine the volume. All these parameters are accessible for the native aspect of the particles while AFM works under ambient temperature and pressure. We present here the analysis of wood combustion particles and their morphological parameters. Using our results for the 3D values, we were able to calculate the fractal dimension (Df) of the aggregates. As the Df is characteristic to the aggregation regime that particles undergo, we determined that wood particle aggregates follow a diffusion limited aggregation regime (Df=1.95). In parallel, in-situ analysis of the hydration effect has been studied in water at pH 7 and shows that the morphology is significantly influenced by the hydration. The composition observed by analytical electron microscopy (AEM) and atomic emission spectrometry (AES) enabled us to correlate the in-situ measurements by AFM with the hydration behavior of these particles and the fractal dimension. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {Measurements of particles < 10 μm (PM10) and particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pPAH) were performed in different passenger train coaches between Zürich and Berne, the most busy intercity connection in Switzerland. All trains are electrified and the indoor air quality is regulated by a mechanical ventilation system. In the smoker sections, pPAH levels were on average about 250 ng m-3, PM10 levels about 950 μg m-3. In the non-smoker section, pPAH levels were about 45 ng m-3 and PM10 levels about 210 μg m-3. Our observations suggest that smoking is the most important source of pPAH and PM10. The spatial variation within the coaches indicates that pPAHs spread out from the smoker compartments into the non-smoker compartments. For PM10, resuspended material may also be a source of airborne PM10 but the contribution within this non-stop connection with most of the passengers being seated all the time was probably small. The influence of outdoor PM10 and pPAH on indoor levels was negligible. Both pollutants, pPAH and PM10 were largely elevated in the smoker as well as in the non-smoker compartments. Despite this fact, a questionnaire on the quality of travelling showed that most of the passengers felt well and only a small proportion felt uneasy. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {Atmospheric particulate matter, from three sites in the city of Campos dos Goytacazes, and smoke samples from the burning of sugarcane leaves and bagasse were analyzed for biomass burning emissions. Samples were acquired using a standard high-volume air sampler; extracts were prepared and fractionated into aromatic and polar compounds. These fractions were subjected to gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses. Polar and aromatic fractions were identified and quantified. Compounds such as levoglucosan, galactosan, mannosan were found in the polar fractions, and some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the aromatic fractions. Concentrations of levoglucosan ranged from 0.15 to 1.65ng/m3, 0.36 to 6.83ng/m3 and 0.19 to 28.42ng/m3 at the downtown Corpo de Bombeiros, suburban (Universidade Estadual do Norte Fluminense) and countryside (Lake de Cima, LC) sites; and from 10.55 to 35.06ng/m3 and 2.7ng/m3 in the smoke samples from the burnt leaves and bagasse, respectively. The LC site is, at face value, a non-polluted countryside area, surrounded by sugarcane plantations. This fact explains why the highest concentrations of levoglucosan were detected there. Sugarcane burning is not the main source of toxic compounds, such as PAH, e.g. benzo(a)pyrene, in the atmospheric particulate matter. No or small concentrations of PAHs were found in the sugarcane leaves/bagasse burning samples. Their presence in the studied sites can be ascribed to vehicular exhaust. Therefore, these are the two major sources of atmospheric pollution in this area. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Hourly data of PM10 concentration collected from an air quality-monitoring network has been analyzed over Taiwan from 1994 to 1999. Fourteen sites from 72 monitoring stations were selected to evaluate the spatial and seasonal variations in the regions of north, southwest, south, east and National Park. The selected monitoring sites are located in a suburban environment, except Nantz and Linyuan that are located in industrial areas. Moreover, Yangming and Hengchuen are located in National Park. Spatial and seasonal variations of PM10 concentrations are rather large over Taiwan. Annual average in south is approximately six times higher than in National parks. In northern sites, the highest concentration occurs in March-May, which is attributed to the occurrence of dust storms in arid regions of central Asia and the transport of dust by northeasterly monsoon. A marked seasonal variation of PM10 concentrations can be observed both in southwestern and southern regions. The pattern is characterized by high concentrations in winter and low in summer. Appearance of the highest monthly PM10 concentration in winter of south may be in part due to the lowest number of monthly precipitation days and low temperature, both of which occurred in winter. The frequency of PM10 daily mean concentration for exceeded 150μgm-3 is 15% during winter in south, which reflects the serious pollution problem there. Monitoring sites in National Park are representatives of remote environments, but the PM10 concentrations are still affected by the dust storms and human activities. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   abstract = {Metal constituents of filters collected from 1996 through 1998 from five monitoring network stations of Mexico City, were identified using ionization argon coupled plasma. Nine metals were quantified: cadmium, chromium, copper, manganese, nickel, lead, titanium, iron and vanadium. The statistical analysis shows that in general the metal concentration diminished from 1996 to 1998 in total suspended particles and PM10 although there are some exceptions. The correlation between TSP and PM10 shows that there is a higher proportion of metals in the respirable fraction than in the particles with bigger diameter. Lead content did not exceed the standard concentration of 1.5μg/m3; with an average value of 0.09 in PM10 and 0.17, in TSP and the highest values of this metal were 1.03 and 0.96 for PM10 and TSP, respectively, both in January of 1996. The study of size and shape by scanning electronic microscopy led us to identify particles from natural soils and clays, from combustion and from industrial processes. Copyright © 2001 .},

Sampling was carried out using Gent stacked filter unit sampler at a sampling station (traffic representative) in Beijing city. Two hundred and ten samples were collected during 1999 and 2000 in two size fractions of PM10 (coarse) and PM2.5 (fine). About 45 elements were determined for most of the samples by instrumental neutron activation analysis. Enrichment factor analysis and Factor Analysis were performed based on data determined. Possible sources of the APM were preliminarily identified. Some interesting correlation was observed between sandstorm episode and the variation of relevant element concentrations. In general, during the sandstorm episodes the concentrations of crust elements with natural origin increase dramatically and the increase of fine fraction is usually higher than that of coarse fraction. On the contrary, the pollution elements of local origin decrease during sandstorm episodes. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},
